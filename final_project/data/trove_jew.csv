"  Morality  for  the  modern  Jew   Title:   The  Jewish  Moral  Virtues   Authors  Eugene  B  Horowitz  and   Frances  Weinman  Schwartz   Publisher;  The  Jewish  Publication   Society,  $55.00   Reviewer:  Michelle  Stein-Evers   THE  literature  of  practical  wis   dom,  Musar,  has  guided  generar  tions  of  Jews  in  matters  of  piety  throughout  the  ages.  Indeed,  the  Musar  movement  of  the  19th  century,  which,  led  by  Rabbi  Israel  Salanter,  historically  taught  ethics  in  theyeshiv  ot,  still  lives  in  more  traditional  com  munities.  By  contrast,  this  book,  writ  ten  by  Eugene  Borowitz  and  Frances  Schwartz,  teachers  at  the  rabbinic  seminary  of  the  Reform  movement,  New  York’s  Hebrew  Union  College,  is  firmly  outside  that  Musar  movement.   The  Jewish  Moral  Virtues  arose  out  of  a  course  which  Borowitz  taught,  based  on  the  untranslated,  but  recent,  Israeli  edition  of  Sefer  Maalot  Hamiddotby  13th-century  Roman  Jew  Yehiel  b  Yekutiel  b  Binyamin  Harofe.  He  was  a  scribe,  a  man  who  lived  before  Jews  had  personal  social  free  dom.  His  choice  of  values,  collected  in  his  Sefer,  focuses  on  those  which  enrich  one’s  personal  life.   For  seven  years  Borowitz  went  through  Harofe’s  Mediaeval  moral  handbook,  concentrating  on  the  24  values  listed  in  the  text  with  his  rabbinical  students.  The  students  each  researched  a  particular  value  and  that  research  forms  the  back  bone  of  the  resultant  book,  each  chapter  focusing  on  a  different  value,  such  as  wisdom,  compas   sion,  lovingkindness  and  charity.   Each  virtue  is  examined  in  depth,  and  examples  are  given  as  to  how  it  can  best  be  realised  in  our  modem  age.  The  translations  of  some  of  the   Hebrew  terms  used  are  sometimes  different  to  what  is  expected  (emunah  as  “trustworthiness”,  not  the  more  commonly  accepted  “faith”),  but  when  that  is  done,  it  is  explained  and,  in  the  end,  seems  to  make  the  terms  more  understandable.   The  prose  has  been  reworked  to  reflect  the  current  preoccupation  with  sexism.  Language  has  been  “demasculinised”  in  order  to  make  the  text’s  message  more  accessible  to  readers.  In  some  chapters,  one  can  hear  or  read  that  feminine  voice,  as  represented  by  Schwartz.  That  con  versation  between  the  masculine  (represented  by  Borowitz)  and  femi  nine  adds  to  the  intimacy  and  imme  diacy  of  the  text.   The  result  is  a  pleasant  marriage  of  scholarly  information,  homey  insights  and  examples  from  modem  daily  life.  Each  chapter  ends  with  a  collection  of  Jewish  folk  aphorisms,  quotes  from  Talmud  and  other  sources,  which  tie  the  concerns  of  the  topic  up  nicely.  It  is  a  book  that  can  be  read  through  and  enjoyed  in  order,  or  dipped  into  for  personal  reflection.  But  upon  reaching  the  end  of  a  chap  ter  or  the  book,  one  feels  that  one  has  been  blessed  with  a  new  sense  of  what  makes  a  Jewish  life  work  in  these  times  of  moral  insecurity.   Because  this  book  is  not  written  like  the  more  traditional,  pietistic  texts  of  Jewish  morals  and  living,  it  will  easily  resonate  among  those  who   like  their  Judaism  to  be  more  philo  sophical  and  less  traditionally  rab  binic.  Borowitz,  the  most  eminent  the  ologian  at  Hebrew  Union  College,  has  made  his  career  re-examining  Jewish  theology  and  its  workability  in  the  modem  and  post-modem  eras.  He  has  written  extensively  on  the  dilem  mas  modem  Jews  find  themselves  in,  trying  to  decide  which  part  of  one’s  life  is  Jewish  and  which  part  modem.  His  1993  book,  Renewing  the  Covenant  A  Theology  for  die  Post-mod  ern  Jew,  examines  in  detail  these  dilemmas  from  a  philosophical  van  tage  point.  Taken  together  with  The  Jewish  Moral  Virtues,  the  two  answer  many  questions  posed  by  members  of  the  community  who  choose  to  live  modem  lives  but  might  have  lost  Jewish  direction.   As  no-one  really  knows  why  Harofe  chose  some  values  over  others  (there  is,  for  example,  a  chapter  devoted  to  wealth,  but  not  to  justice),  the  choice  of  virtues  might  seem  odd.  But  the  timelessness  of  the  problem—name  ly,  what  are  the  qualities  we  hold  dear  as  Jews  and  how  would  we  imple  ment  them  in  active  and  challenging  lives  —  becomes  evident  when  we  look  at  Harofe’s  list  of  values.  It  is  com  forting  to  think  that  generations  have  stood  here  before  us  with  the  same  existential  questions  and  have  found  comfort  in  the  same  eternal  values.   In  the  epilogue,  “Post-Modem  Musaf,  the  writers  look  at  the  mod  em  civic  virtues  of  social  justice,  free  dom  and  democracy  and  at  what  they  consider  to  be  the  three  most  impor  tant  virtues:  tolerance,  hope  and  bal  ance.  To  them,  modernity  is  unbear   able  without  these,  and  without  faith  in  the  “Senior  Partner”  there  isn’t  much  of  a  Jewish  future.   This  is  a  friendly,  touching  book,  which  no  matter  how  you  look  at  it,  seeks  to  gently  guide  and  heal.  It  speaks  in  a  soft,  but  serious,  voice   about  the  hard  decisions  with  which  we  are  faced  and  the  virtues  that  can  make  those  sometimes  difficult  choic  es  easier  to  bear.

"  JERUSALEM:  One  of  the  13  Iranian  Jews  on  trial  in  the  southern  Iranian  city  of  Shiraz  has  “admitted”  spying  for  Israel.   It  is  unclear  whether  Hamid  Danny  Tefileen  —  whose  “confes  sion”  was  screened  by  Iranian  State  Television  —  will  take  the  fall  for  the  entire  group,  or  if  his  “confession”  will  provide  ammunition  for  punishing  some  or  all  of  the  accused.  Tefileen  is  believed  to  be  the  leader  of  the  13.   According  to  Israel  Radio,  Tefileen,  one  of  13  Jews  being  tried  for  espionage  and  harming  state  security,  “admitted”  being  paid  and  trained  by  Israel’s  Mossad  secret  service  in  order  to  transfer  information  about  Iran.  His  lawyer  said  that  Tefileen  received  money  from  Israel.  A  devoutly  religious  man,  he  admitted  visiting   Israel  in  1994.   In  speculating  on  why  Tefileen,  an  impoverished  trader,  had  “confessed”  to  spying,  observers  believe  that  he  may  have  been  facing  other  trumped-up  charges,  such  as  drug  possession  or  smuggling.  He  may  have  been  offered  leniency  if  he  confessed  to  the  spying  charge;  or  perhaps  the  freedom  of  his  brother,  Omid,  was  dangled  before  him.  Omid  is  one  of  three  who  was  released  on  bail  in  February,  and  is  likely  to  be  pardoned.   Either  way,  said  Malcolm  Hoenlein,  executive  vice-chairman  of  the  Conference  of  Presidents  of  Major  American  Jewish  Organisations,  Tefileen  and  the  rest  are  innocent.  “If  this  doesn’t  give  all  the  appearances  of  a  set-up,  I  don’t  know  what  does,”  he  said.  “Listen,  you  sit  in  jail  for  a  year,  in  conditions  no  one  knows  about.  How  can  we  judge  someone  in  that  situation?”   “If  this  doesn’t  give  all  the  appearances  of  a   set-up,  I  don’t  know  what  does.”   Tefileen’s  court-appointed  lawyer,  Shirzad  Rahmani,  told  reporters  that  the  “confession”  is  not  enough  to  convict.  Under  Iranian  law,  Rahmani  noted,  the  state  has  to  prove  its  case  with  evidence.  “There  may  have  been  confessions,  there  may  have  been  an  intention  to  spy,  there  may  have  been  several  trips  to  Israel  and  there  may  have  been  payments,”  he  said.  “But  if  infor  mation  damaging  to  Iran  and  beneficial  to  Israel  was  not  actually  exchanged,  there  can  be  no  charge  of  espionage.”   Tefileen  was  the  first  of  the  13  to  be  arrested.  He  has  been  in  detention  for  a  year.  He  reportedly  asked  the  judge  to  show  mercy.  Espionage  is  punishable  in  Iran  by  death.  Tefileen  was  the  only  suspect  brought  to  the  court  when  the  trial  opened.  A  court  spokesman  said  that  the  trial  is  expected  to  last  six-to-seven  months..  The  hearings  are  being  held  behind  closed  doors.  However  reports  say  that  large  numbers  of  relatives,  foreign  observers  and  diplomats  and  two  of  the  Jews  who  were  released  on  bail  gathered  outside  the  courtroom.   After  the  hearing,  the  Iranian  authorities  accused  Tefileen  of  spying  for  “the  love  of  Israel”  —  and  for  the  money.  Israel  stead  fastly  denies  the  link.  “We  don’t  have  anything  new  to  say  from  what  we  have  said  in  the  past,”  Israeli  Foreign  Ministry  spokesman  Aviv  Sharon  told  reporters  in  Israel.  “We  don’t  have  any  connection  with  any  of  those  who  stand  trial  now  in  Iran.”   But  it  is  the  Israeli  stamp  in  Tefileen’s  passport  that  seems  to  be,  from  Iran’s  perspective,  the  smoking-gun  for  the  entire  case,  said  Hoenlein.  “Without  him,  there’s  no  case,”  said  Hoenlein,  who  has  been  closely  monitoring  developments  taking  place  in  Iran.  “Getting  him  to  confess  was  crucial.”   In  this  and  all  Iranian  court  cases,  the  judge  also  acts  as  inves  tigator,  prosecutor  and  jury,  which  observers  say  is  clearly  a   recipe  for  judicial  abuse.

"  PARTISAN   SAM  UPSKi   AS  a  delegate  at  last  week’s  World  Economic  Forum  (boo,  hiss!)  who,  like  many  others  inside  the  cabal  of  capitalism,  has  serious  reservations  about  globalisation  (hurray,  applause!),  one  recurring  theme  is  worth  noting  this  Rosh   Hashana.   Quite  a  segue.  From  globalisation  to  repen  tance.  Well,  not  quite.  The  theme  I  had  in  mind  was  the  WEFs  repeated  emphasis  in  Melbourne  last  week  —  whether  it  came  from  Bill  Gates  or  the  Singapore  technocrats—on  the  importance  of  “lifelong  learning""  in  the  new  economy.  Amazing.  CEOs  and  government  leaders  are  dis  covering  what  the  rabbis  have  known,  preached  and  practised  for  about  25  centuries.  “Men  darf   lemen""—”  We  have  to  learn.”   The  rabbis,  of  course,  meant  learning  Torah.  And  they  meant  learning  it  all  life  long.  The  wiser  Jews  of  modernity,  such  as  Rabbi  Samson  Raphael  Hirsch,  turned  this  into  “We  have  to  learn  other  things  as  well  as  Torah”.  But  then,  as  the  20th  century  unfolded,  the  traditional  Jewish  commitment  to  education  became  wide  ly  secularised  (by  the  Zionists  and  Bundists  as  well  as  the  assimilationists)  into  “We  have  to  learn  everything  but  Torah”.   Encouragingly,  in  recent  years,  the  pendulum  has  swung  back,  at  least  somewhat.  The  bur   geoning  of  Jewish  studies  in  Israel  and  the  Diaspora,  a  still  numerically  small  but  influential  generation  of  modern/Orthodox  and  non  Orthodox,  secular  and  religious,  proponents  of  being  Jewishly  literate  as  well  as  secularly  edu  cated,  and  the  multi-media  revolution  itself,  have  all  contributed  to  the  shift  in  attitude.   Which,  as  we  approach  this  globalised  Rosh  Hashana,  leaves  us  where?  With  hope  for  the  Jewish  future,  that’s  where.  Quantitatively  as  well  as  qualitatively.  Globalisation  and  its  dis  contents  offer  Jews  great  opportunities  as  well  as  great  challenges.  For  amidst  all  the  pes  simistic  predictions,  let’s  recall  that  Jews  were  the  first,  and  certainly  the  longest-surviving,  globalised  people  with  “lifelong  learning”  as  a  fundamental.  That  basic  resource,  however   Globalisation  and  assimilation  are  minor-league  dangers.   Provided  we  don't  forget  that  the  one  constant  counter-force  has   been  commitment  to  lifelong  learning.”   buried  under  the  mounds  of  modernity,  is  still  there  to  be  revisited,  built  upon,  and  adapted  for  Jewish  renewal.   There  are  two  traps,  however,  in  how  we  move  to  exploit  our  assets.  The  first  trap  is  to  assume  that  the  vast  majority  of  Jews  under  40  are  university  graduates  and  so  interested  in  the  life  of  the  mind.  In  fact,  the  figures  suggest  that  (in  Australia  at  least)  only  about  half  of  our  younger  generation  are  graduates.  And  while  that’s  a  higher  figure  than  the  general  popula  tion,  it  doesn’t  follow  that  all  are  interested  in  ongoing  education  outside  their  work  roles,  or   that  our  non-graduates  are  uninterested  in  pur  suing  Jewish  studies  in  adulthood.   Still,  let’s  agree  that  we  start  with  a  relatively  well-educated,  if  often  Jewishly  illiterate,  younger  generation.  And  that  graduates  or  not,  everybody  in  the  new  economy  is  going  to  have  to  keep  learning  until  retirement  and  beyond.  Provided  the  community  can  grasp  the  radical  notion,  therefore,  that  continuing  Jewish  educa  tion  (post-dayschool)  is  as  important  to  our  future  as  the  dayschools  were  50  years  ago  (and  still  are  in  large  measure),  we  can  actually  do  something  to  withstand  globalisation’s  threats  to  cultural  and  communal  identity.   The  second  trap,  that  of  knowing  exactly  what  we  have  to  teach  without  trying  to  find  out  what  those  we’re  trying  to  reach  might  want  to  learn,   has  been  eloquently  summarised  by  Rabbi  Irwin  Kula,  who  heads  the  New  York-based  National  Jewish  Centre  for  Learning  and  Leadership.  As  Kula  has  put  it,  the  Jewish  conti  nuity  industry  may  disagree  amongst  them  selves  as  to  what  should  be  transmitted,  but  they  generally  agree  it  means  passing  on  some  predetermined  “essence”  of  Judaism  or  some  “core”  experience  to  save  Diaspora  Jewry  from   the  survival  “crisis”.   But  Kula  then  asks  a  provocative  question  which  we  might  ponder  this  Rosh  Hashana.  What  if  there’s  no  “crisis”  in  Diaspora  Jewish  life,   at  least  in  terms  of  individual  Jewish  identity;  Consider  the  same  data:  while  one  in  every  two  marriages  of  an  American  Jew  is  to  someone  who’s  not  Jewish,  and  while  only  one  third  of  American  Jews  bother  to  belong  to  a  Jewish  organisation,  participate  in  a  synagogue,  or  con  sider  that  travel  to  Israel  matters,  90  percent  told  the  researchers  that  they  were  “proud  to  be   Jewish.”   Now  it’s  easy  to  argue  that  all  that  those  fig  ures  show  is  that  “pride”  in  being  Jewish  today,  in  a  world  where  the  traditional  borders,  physi  cal  and  cultural,  are  breaking  down,  does  not  extend  to  doing  Jewish.  But  it’s  also  possible  to  conclude,  as  does  Kula,  that  measuring  the  vital  ity  and  potential  of  Jewish  life  today  requires   other  criteria.   As  an  example,  he  asks  us  to  imagine  what  the  demographers  of  the  immediate  post-Temple  era  might  have  concluded  if  they  had  had  to  focus  their  attention  on  the  absence  of  animal  sacrifice.  To  quote  from  a  survey  report  circa  300  CE:  “Sacrifice,  and  the  belief  in  its  continued  importance  are  way  down,  thus  Jewish  identity  and  continuity  are  fast  eroding.”   As  with  all  provocative  thinkers  Kula,  leaves  himself  wide  open  on  some  fronts.  But  his  basic  challenge  is  worth  serious  consideration:  name  ly,  that  Judaism  and  Jewish  continuity  have  often  faced  adaptability  and  adjustment  to  trau  matic  change  and  upheaval.   Compared  to  those  experiences,  globalisation  and  assimilation  are  minor-league  dangers.  Provided,  of  course,  we  don’t  forget  that  the  one  constant  counter-force  throughout  has  been  that  commitment  to  “lifelong  learning.”   Shana  torn  umetuka. ",2000-09-22
"  The  wandering  Jew   ASK  THE  RABBI   Rabbi  Raymond  Apple   THERE  is  a  plant  which  bears  the  name  Wan  o  dering  Jew  because  it  is  has  a  tendency  to   spread.  The  name  was  probably  given  with  out  conscious  antisemitic  malice.  There  is  also  a  bird  called  Wandering  Jew,  and  even  a  card  game  and  a  game  of  dice.  However,  in  Christian  legend  there  is  certainly  a  mythical  figure  called  the  Wandering  Jew  who  embod  ies  anti-Jewish  animus.  The  underlying  notion  is  that  the  Jews  are  destined  to  wan  der  and  be  reviled  because  they  rejected   Jesus.   Not  until  the  13th  century  did  it  become  a  clearly  antisemitic  legend,  often  linked  with  the  tradition  that  an  officer  of  the  high  priesthood  struck  Jesus  on  the  way  to  the  ‘'""cross  and  Jesus  condemned  him  to  suffer   punishment  until  the  so-called  second  com  ing.  (“You  will  go  on  forever  until  I  return”  is  what  Jesus  is  said  to  have  told  him.)  The  Wandering  Jew  is  said  to  be  called  Aha  suerus,  the  same  name  as  the  Persian  king  in  the  story  of  Mordechai  and  Esther.   Centuries  of  anti-Jewish  prejudice  inex  orably  conditioned  Christian  communities  to  see  the  Jew  as  a  pathetic  sinner  doomed  by  his  rejection  of  Jesus.  The  Wandering  Jew  vwas  given  different  names  in  different  ver  sions  of  the  story  and  became  the  central  character  in  a  sheaf  of  poems,  novels  and  artistic  and  musical  works,  though  the  tragedy  of  the  Holocaust  has  largely  dis  credited  the  notion.  However,  some  funda  mentalist  Christian  circles  who  hang  on  to  the  story  find  it  hard  to  come  to  terms  with  the  vitality,  dignity  and  creativity  of  the  Jew  ish  people  and  the  vibrancy  of  the  State  of   Israel.   ■  Reprinted  from  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple’s  V  email  list:  torah@greatsynagogue.org.au.

"  Jewish  news   I  AM  intrigued  that  the  Australian  Jewish  News  devoted  so  much  space  to  the  millennium  and  the  Sydney  Jews  who  observed  it  (AJN  7/1/00).   After  all,  it  may  be  an  important  event  for  our  Christian  friends,  but  has  no  Jewish  significance.  The  mainstream  media  gave  it  saturation  coverage.   Secondly,  it  is  not  the  actual  millennium  of  the  event  it  celebrates.  Thirdly,  why  should  a  Jewish  newspaper  cover  the  celebration  of  a  millennium  which  began  with  massacres  of  Jews  in  Germany  and  elsewhere  (the  Crusades)  and  also  ended  with  massacres  of  Jews  in  Germany  and  elsewhere  (the  Shoah)?   Of  course,  most  Sydney  Jews,  regard  less  of  level  of  Jewish  observance,  watched  the  fireworks.  Some  Sydney  Jews  also  celebrate  Xmas.

"  Jewish  writing   I  APPRECIATE  Paul  Kraus’  letter  (AJN  23/6/00)  as  it  demonstrates  the  suc  cess  of  one  of  my  aims  in  editing  the  anthology  Enough  Already—to  excite  response  out  of  an  examination  of  the   issues.   In  my  foreword,  I  stated  that  my  motivation  was  to  explore  the  con  cerns  preoccupying  Australian  Jewish  writers,  born  post-war,  in  the  last  ten  years.  I  was  spurred  on  by  Nancy  Keesing’s  remark  in  1978  that  “there  are  not,  and  never  have  been,  many  Australian  Jewish  writers  of  fic   tion”.   Mr  Kraus  seems  to  miss  the  point  when  he  states  that  the  Holocaust  is  a   key  theme.  It  was  not  the  Holocaust  itself,  but  its  shadow  hanging  over  this  generation  of  writers  that  informs  a  large  number  of  stories.  I  wanted  to  probe  the  “experiences,  obsessions  and  angst  of  children  of  survivors”;  the  writings  could  only  have  been  selected  from  the  material  available.   At  no  time  did  I  attempt  a  precon  ceived  approach  to  Jewish  identity.  The  theme  of  identity  was  intended  to  be  loose.  Jewish  artists  and  writers  encompass  the  broadest  diversity.  They  work  in  one  of  the  most  vibrant  ly  multicultural'societies  in  the  world,  and  this  is  reflected.  In  every  genera  tion,  Jewish  artists  have  been  involved  in  the  presentation  of  their  creative  endeavours  in  a  liberating  fashion.  The  same  could  be  said  of  artists  from  other  religious  back  grounds.  Without  Modigliani,  Schiele  and  Philip  Roth,  Western  culture   would  be  the  poorer.  Should  Salman  Rushdie  have  thought  twice?   As  for  his  outrage  at  my  Bar  Mitzvah  of  a  Nazi,  satire  has  been  cru  cial  in  the  armoury  of  Jewish  survival.  Using  this  device,  I  considered  it  valid  to  investigate  the  absurdity  of  German  Jews  who  sought  to  embrace  Nazism,  so  skewed  with  jingoism  had  they  become.  The  paradox  they  rep  resented  lent  itself  to  my  develop  ment  of  a  Kafkaesque  scenario,  root  ed  in  fact.   As  for  borrowing  the  “Nazi  defini  tion  of  Jewish  identity”,  it  was  tongue  in-cheek.  Insensitive,  it  could  be  argued,  but  no  malicious  intent.  It  served  as  a  functional  method  of  explaining  the  inclusion  of  writers  not  Jewish  by  formal  definition.   One  of  my  pleasures  as  former  director  of  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  was  the  awakening  of  aware  ness  of  Jewish  roots  among  visitors.  Hence  my  interest  in  including  writ  ers  from  the  edge  of  Judaism,  such  as  Judy  Horocek,  whose  Jewish  father   was  reused  as  a  Catholic.  Is  it  neces   sary  that  my  selection  for  a  Jewish  anthology  be  narrow  and  exclusion  ary  to  “accurately  reflect  contempo  rary  Jewish  life  and  thought”  as  defined  by  Mr  Kraus?   1  invite  him,  and  others  sharing  his  views,  to  explain  how  Enough  Already  inaccurately  reflects  contemporary  Jewish  life  and  thought,  and  how  “this  anthology  does  little  to  promote  Jewish  writing  or  culture  to  the  wider  community”.

"  UTILISING  multi-media,  art  and  design  to  take  visitors  on  a  journey  through  the  history  and  major  events  of  Jewish  culture,  a  new  exhibition  has  opened  at  the  Jewish  Museum  of  Australia   in  Melbourne.   Entitled  The  Timeline  of  Jewish  History,  it  was  opened  by  Victorian  Minister  for  the  Arts  and  Education  Mary  Delahunty  and  museum  patron  Sir  Zelman  Cowan.  The  exhibition  incorporates  300  filmic  scenes  displayed  in  conjunction  with  text,  images  and  objects  to  explore  a  number  of  themes,  including  the  origins  of  the  Jews  as  a  nation  and  the  diversity  of  Jewish  history  and   culture.   Senator  Kay  Patterson,  Sir  Zelman  Cowen,  Pauline   Gandei  and  MLC  Andrea  Coote.   Jewish  Museum  of  Australia  director  Helen  Light  said  they  had  formulated  the  exhibition  for  a  broad  audience.  “We  developed  the  exhibition  so  that  it  is  engaging,  entertaining  and  relevant  to  the  wider  community,  as  well  as  the  Jewish  community.  The  challenge  was  to  encompass  a  rich,  complex,  long  and  dynamic  history  in  a  small,  permanent  exhibition  space.”   The  exhibition  has  been  influenced  by  theatre  director  Barrie  Kosky,  Pratt  Foundation  chief  executive  Sam  Lipski  and  Radio  National  pre   senter  Dr  Rachael  Kohn.   Mr  Lipski:  “The  Jewish  Museum  acts  as  a  bridge  to  greater  understanding,  promoting  tol  erance  between  all  people  through  appreciation  of  the  richness  and  diversity  of  Jewish  life,  his  tory  and  culture.”   Victorian  Minister  for  the  Arts  and  Education  Mary  Delahunty ",2000-05-19
"  MY  sincere  congratulations  for  your  coverage  of  the  Jewish  gay  and  lesbian  float  in  the  Mardi  Gras.  I  have  only  previously  bought  one  copy  of  the  Jewish  News,  and  since  this  event  has  raised  its  challenging  head,  I  have  bought  all  three.   As  you  will  see  by  my  signature,  I  carry  a  well  known  Jewish  name.  My  father  was  the  descen  dant  of  generations  of  Cohens  in  Australia,  the  original  one  arriving  here  in  the  1830s.  He  was  the  first  in  his  family  to  marry  out.  He  took  that  seriously,  and  while  he  continued  to  practise  as  a  Jew,  he  and  my  mother’s  five  children  were  raised  with  almost  no  knowledge,  understanding  or  respect  for  the  Jewish  religion  and  culture.   I  grew  up  believing  it  must  be  a  bad  thing  to  be  Jewish.  In  how  many  other  mixed  marriages  would  children  not  learn  of  the  culture  of  both  parents?  Unfortunately,  my  father  died  when  1  was  16,  so  I  missed  out  on  the  opportunity  of  learning  from  him  later.   In  adult  life,  while  living  in  Adelaide,  I  became  a  member  of  a  Jewish  feminist  lesbian  group  who  accepted  me  for  who  I  am  and  gave  me  the  opportunity  to  learn  and  value  my  Jewish  her  itage.  I  still  consider  them  my  Jewish  family  and  will  be  going  to  Adelaide  to  celebrate  Pesach  with  them.  I  am  not  religious,  but  I  am  of  Jewish  heritage  and  I  want  to  be  proud  of  that.  I  have  often  felt  more  comfortable  to  be  out  as  a  lesbian  than  as  a  Jew.   The  fact  that  during  the  Holocaust  not  only  Jews  were  murdered,  but  also  lesbian  and  gay  Jews,  makes  me  wonder  would  the  voices  who  currently  deny  us  the  right  to  be  part  of  the  greater  Jewish  community  have  also  not  sup  ported  us  then  —  even  if  we  were  their  children,  relatives  or  friends?  Your  courage  is  to  be  applauded.  Thank-you  for  your  support.   Dinah  Cohen  Bondi,  NSW ",2000-04-07
"  Exploring  Jewish  identity   TWO  visiting  Israeli  scholars  discussed  Jewish  history  and  Israeli  identity  at  a  talk  organised  by  the  Joint  Committee  for  Jewish  Higher  Education,  NSW  Friends  of  the  Hebrew  University,  Mandelbaum  House  and  Hakoah  Club.   Hebrew  University  History  Professor  Yom  Tov  Assis  and  Ben-Gurion  University  History  Professor  Han  Troen  were  both  visiting  pro  fessors  at  the  University  of  Sydney  and  lec  tured  throughout  the  community.  Professor  Assis  was  hosted  by  the  NSW  Friends  of  the  Hebrew  University  and  Professor  Troen  was  scholar-in-residence  at  Mandelbaum  House.   Both  speakers  drew  attention  to  the  posi  tive  reconstruction  of  Jewish  life  and  identity  after  catastrophes  in  Jewish  history  —  the  Expulsion  from  Spain  in  1492  and  the  Holocaust.  The  discussion  was  chaired  by  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  past  president   Peter  Wertheim.   Professor  Assis  spoke  about  the  Expulsions  from  Spain  and  Portugal  at  the  end  of  the  15th  century,  covering  involuntary  mass  conver  sions,  forced  individual  conversions  and  the  Inquisition  when  Sephardi  Jews  experienced  persecution,  yet  managed  to  preserve  their  identity.  They  eventually  emigrated  to  the   Ottoman  Empire,  the  only  area  which  tolerat  ed  a  Jewish  presence  in  that  region.   He  drew  attention  to  a  recent  heightened  awareness  of  Sephardi  history  and  culture  and  an  intense  interest  in  university  research   in  this  field.   Professor  Troen  spoke  of  the  shifting  cen  tres  of  Jewish  life  in  the  last  two  centuries.  The  Jewish  exodus  from  Europe,  which  began  in  the  19th  century  and  was  accelerated  by  the  Shoah,  moved  the  Jewish  centre  of  gravity  to  Israel  and  the  English-speaking  countries,  with  Israel  a  Jewish  cultural  and  spiritual  cen  tre.  Moreover,  from  being  a  pre-modern  peo  ple  living  predominantly  in  rural  regions,  the  Jews  had  become  the  most  modern  of  people,  residing  predominantly  in  cities.   Professor  Troen  also  analysed  the  differ  ences  between  the  self-perceptions  of  Israeli  Jews  and  Diaspora  Jews.  Israelis  are  brought  up  with  the  ethos  of  self-determination  and  see  themselves  as  citizens  of  a  state  which  they  have  created.  They  constantly  seek  and  find  evidence  of  their  ancient  roots  in  the  soil  of  Eretz  Yisrael  with  its  wealth  of  archaeologi  cal  material.  In  the  Diaspora,  on  the  other  hand,  Jews  have  to  negotiate  with  the  domi  nant  cultures  about  the  terms  on  which  they   will  exist  as  Jews  and  as  communities.   Professor  Troen  expressed  optimism  about  the  continued  strength  and  vitality  of  the  Jewish  people,  stressing  that  an  important  bond  uniting  Jews  across  time  and  space  is  engagement  with  shared  classical  texts.  Universities  supplement  Jewish  institutions  in  providing  opportunities  for  familiarity,  study  and  research  into  these  sources,  he  said.

"  Jewish  youth  denied  refuge  in  Australia   AN  American  teenager  has  tried  unsuccessful  ly  to  claim  refugee  status  in  Australia,  citing  fear  of  religious  persecution  from  his  mother,  an  ultra-Orthodox  Jew.   The  Federal  Court  in  Sydney  has  upheld  a  decision  by  the  Refugee  Review  Tribunal  to  refuse  his  application.   The  bid  appears  to  be  part  of  a  battle  for  cus  tody  between  the  youth’s  divorced  parents.  His  father  is  an  Australian  citizen  living  in  Australia,  while  his  mother  lives  in  the  United  States.   The  youth  appeared  before  the  tribunal  last  year  with  legal  representation,  but  was  repre  sented  in  the  Federal  Court  before  Justice   Catherine  Branson  by  his  father.  His  mother   was  described  as  “an  enthusiastic  follower  of  an  ultra-Orthodox  Jewish  sect”  and  a  member  of  a  “cult”  who  had  abused  him  over  a  long  period.  It  was  claimed  that  he  was  abused  by  his  foster  families  and  members  of  the  ultra  Orthodox  community.   The  youth  claimed  to  know  of  a  murder  and  organised  criminal  activities  in  the  community,  had  refused  to  become  a  “priest”  and  stated  that  his  legal  guardian  and  the  judge  in  his  cus  tody  case  were  members  of  the  same  commu  nity.  The  tribunal  accepted  these  as  facts,  although  not  to  the  extent  claimed.   The  tribunal  accepted  that  the  teenager  did  not  wish  to  live  an  Orthodox  religious  life.  He  listed  Reform  Judaism  as  his  religion  on  his  application  for  a  protection  visa.  The  tribunal  agreed  that  his  fears  of  harm  if  he  returned  to  the  US  were  well-founded  and  sufficiently  seri  ous  to  amount  to  persecution,  but  found  that  the  main  reason  for  harm  was  not  religious  in  origin,  but  because  of  his  refusal  to  conform  and  his  violation  of  authority.   It  concluded  that  he  had  been  “embroiled  in  a  very  sad  and  acrimonious  custody  dispute,  and  has  been  abused  by  a  dysfunctional  and  fanatically  religious  mother,  as  well  as  abusive  members  of  her  community”.   It  also  concluded  that  he  would  be  entitled  to  the  usual  benefits  of  his  US  citizenship  and  pro  tection  of  his  human  rights  if  he  returned,  par  ticularly  as  the  most  recent  US  Family  Court  order  had  removed  his  mother’s  legal  control  over  him.  Whilst  sympathetic  to  his  “tragic  plight”,  the  Federal  Court  rejected  the  appeal. ",2000-06-09
"  Brandon  Cofcsai   SIGNING  a  Jewish  player  would  be  problematic  for  Aussie  Rules  club-owner  Joseph  Gutnick.   President  of  the  Melbourne  Football  Club   (known  as  the  Demons),  Mr  Gutnick  said  before   last  year’s  Australian   Melbourne  Football  Club  president  Joseph  Gutnick   Football  League  national  draft  that  recruiting  a  Jewish  player  would  “create  a  problem”  for  him.   Rabbi  and  director  of  Melbourne’s  Caulfield   Chabad  House,  the  mining  magnate  admitted  that  he  would  be  forced  to  resign  if  his  club  drafted  a  Jewish   player.   Demons  football  operations  manager  Danny  Corcoran  said  Mr  Gutnick  had  pointed  out  that  selecting  a  Jewish  player  would  be  a  “sensitive”  issue  for  him,  but  at  no  stage  did  he  instruct  the  club  not  to  draft  Jewish  youngster  Ezra  Poyas.   Poyas,  a  former  Sandringham  Dragons  under  18  player,  was  drafted  by  the  Richmond  club.  Poyas’  father,  Sam,  played  for  Ajax  during  the   1960s.   Mr  Gutnick  told  the  Melbourne  Herald-Sun  last  week  from  London,  where  he  was  on  a  business  trip,  that  he  would  be  compromised  if  a  Jewish  player  did  not  observe  Shabbat.   “I  am  very  much  involved  in  the  club,  but  [recruiting  a  Jewish  player]  would  compromise  me,  and  therefore  I  would  not  be  able  to  be  pres   ident  and  I  would  stand  aside  without  a  doubt,”  he  said.  “If  there  was  a  Jewish  recruit  and  Melbourne  wanted  him,  I  would  insist  the  club  take  him  because  they  have  to  get  the  best  play  ers.  I  would  not  stand  in  their  way.  1  would  stand  aside  as  president,  but  I  would  continue  to  sup  port  the  club.  I  had  a  duty  to  tell  the  committee  that  with  me,  there  would  be  an  issue  with  Poyas.  But  there  certainly  wasn’t  a  directive  from  me  not  to  pick  him.”   Former  Australian  Jewish  News  acting  editor  and  author  of  the  Recently-released  books  Diamonds  and  Demons,  David  Bernstein,  said  that  had  a  Jewish  player  been  drafted  by  the  Demons,  Mr  Gutnick’s  position  would  simply   have  become  “untenable”.   “Joe  simply  cannot,  as  an  Orthodox  religious  Jew,  turn  a  blind  eye  to  a  Jewish  player  playing  on  the  Sabbath  in  his  side.  And  what  he  would  have  done  had  that  arisen—and  you  can  only  specu  late  —  is  that  his  position  may  have  become  untenable.  He  may  have  had  to  quit.  Joseph  would  simply  not  be  able  to  function;  it  would  be  an  impossible  situation  for  him.”   Another  Jewish  teenage  player,  and  Poyas’  team-mate  at  the  Dragons,  Jeremy  Dukes,  was  drafted  by  Carlton.   The  last  Jewish  footballer  to  play  in  the  AFL  was  current  Ajax  full  forward  Julian  Kirzner,  who  played  with  Essendon,  Carlton  and  North   Melbourne  in  the  mid-1990s.

"  International   was  a   NEW  YORK:  One  of  the  13  Iranian  Jews  accused  of  spying  for  Israel,  has  reportedly  admitted  that  he  had   lied  in  his  so-called  confession.   Faramaz  Kashi,  one  of  the  eight  who  allegedly  “confessed”  to  spying  and  implicated  his  brother,  said  the   confession  was  untrue.   In  court  in  Shiraz  last  week,  six  of  the  accused  are  reported  to  have   met  face-to-face  for  the  first  time   since  their  imprisonment  15  months  ago.  The  verdict  is  expected  early   this  month.   Several  Jewish-owned  businesses  in  Iran  have  been  attacked  in  recent   days,  with  one,  in  Teheran,  being  set  on  fire.  In  addition,  Jewish  school  children  and  adults  in  the  work   place  have  suffered  public  harass   ment.  The  authorities  have   responded  to  requests  for  protec  tion  by  assigning  security  forces  to  synagogues  and  other  Jewish  insti   tutions.   The  attacks  come  in  the  wake  of  the  trial  of  the  13.  The  trial,  which  has  been  closed  to  observers,  has  seen  eight  of  the  13  allegedly  con  fess  and  five  plead  innocent.  The  so  called  confessions  are  believed  to   have  been  scripted  by  the  Iranian   authorities.   Meanwhile,  several  thousand  American  Jews  held  another  prayer  vigil  in  New  York  —  again  a  stone’s  throw  from  the  Iranian  Mission  to  the  United  Nations.   The  New  York  gathering  would  probably  have  been  much  larger  had  it  not  been  “sabotaged”  by  top   Jewish  community  leaders,  charged  a  sponsor  of  the  vigil,  Rabbi  Avi  Weiss,  president  of  the  Coalition  for  Jewish  Concerns-Amcha.   The  vigil  had  been  advertised  in  the  New  York  Times  and  on  two  radio  stations  —  but  Weiss’  event  clashed  with  behind-the  scenes  Jewish  lobbying  efforts  to  spare  the  Jews  the  death  penalty  or  long  prison  sentences.   The  rift  illustrates  the  divergent  strategies  for  how  best  to  pressure  Iran  —  robust  street  action  or  the  quiet  diplomacy  advocated  by  the  Conference  of  Presidents  of  Major  American  Jewish  Organisations.  Rabbi  Weiss  points  to  the  impact  of  massive  rallies  in  the  1980s  on  behalf  of  Soviet  Jewry  and  how  it  encouraged  people  like  Natan  Sharansky,  the  former  Soviet  Jewish  dissident  who  now  serves  as  Israel’s  Interior  Minister.   “If  prisoners  sense  they  are  not  alone,  they  gain  a  certain  amount  of  strength,”  he  said.  “We  want  the  Iranian  Jews  to  know  their  suffering  is  our  suffering.”   Noting  that  Sharansky  had  voiced  support  for  the  vigil,  he  added:  “I  am  incredulous  that  16  months  after  these  imprisonments,  we  have  not  been  able  to  put  100,000  people  out   on  the  streets  of  New  York.”   Rabbi  Abraham  Cooper,  associate  dean  of  the  Simon  Wiesenthal  Centre,  co-sponsor  of  the  vigil,  joined  Rabbi  Weiss.  “We  want  Iran’s  Jewish  community  taken  off  the  radar  screen”  of  the  Iranian   Iranian  Jews  pray  at  the  Western  Wall  for  the  13  Iranian  Jews  charged  with  spying  for  Israel.   Photo:  Isranet   Government,  he  said.  “We  do  not  want  to  make  the  treatment  of  Jews   a  long-term  thorn  in  the  side  of  bilat   eral  relations  between  America  and  Iran.”   Before  the  vigil,  Malcolm  Hoenlein,  executive  vice-chairman  of  the  Presidents  Conference,  said  it  would  work  against  his  group’s  efforts.  Several  at  the  vigil  alleged   that  Hoenlein  had  discouraged  numerous  organisations  from  par  ticipating.  Hoenlein,  whose  group  had  sponsored  a  previous  vigil,   denied  tne  charge.   JIA ",2000-06-02

"  The  sad  tale  of  the  last  Jew  of  Auschwitz   Hevb  Keim   JERUSALEM:  He  was,  according  to  locals,  the  last  Jew  living  in  the  Polish  city  of  Oswiecim,  a  town  better  known  by  its  German  name  —  Auschwitz.   His  name  was  Shimshon  Klueger  and  he  lived,  said  Polish  guides  at  the  concentration  camp,  as  a  recluse  in  a  basement  hovel—alone,  tortured,  still  believing,  like  some  tormented  character  out  of  an  Elie  Wiesel  novel,  that  the  war  continued  to  rage.   Michael  Berl,  director  of  Morasha  Heritage  Seminars  —  a  Jerusalem-based  centre  that  runs  Holocaust  educational  programs  to  Europe  —  first  heard  of  Klueger  about  a  decade  ago.   Visiting  Auschwitz,  Berl  asked  one  of  the  guides  whether  any  Jews  still  lived  in  the  city,  and  was  told  that  there  was  one  man,  but  that  it  was  impossible  to  see  him.  “All  the  guides  knew  of  him,  but  they  said  no  one  could  talk  to  him   because  he  was  locked  inside  his  room  and  would  not  come  out.”   Berl  went  looking  anyway.  “That  year  we  were  travelling  with  a  young  woman  whose  father  was  a  survivor  and  had  given  her  some  money  to  dis  tribute  to  two  Jews  in  Poland,”  Berl  says.  “We   found  one  person  in  Warsaw,  and  then  when  we  heard  of  Klueger,  she  insisted  she  wanted  to  give  the  rest  of  the  money  to  him.”   Berl  found  the  man’s  home.  “It  was  down  a   whole  mess  of  steps,  off  a  city  street,  in  this  beat  up  looking  hovel;  he  lived  like  a  hermit.  Were  I  a  policeman,  I  would  have  walked  by  this  place  a  hundred  times  a  day  and  never  thought  that  someone  actually  lived  there;  it  looked  like  it  was   in  such  a  shambles.”   With  the  girl  in  tow,  Berl  went  to  the  door,  knocked  and  stammered  something  in  Yiddish.  Klueger  replied:  ""Gay  avek,  gay  avek!  (Go  away,  go  away!)”.   Berl  left,  after  depositing  a  few  coins  in  a  wood   en  bowl  outside  the  man’s  door  —  the  same   bowl  used  by  townspeople  to  leave  Klueger  food,  coffee  and  water  over  the  years  following   the  war.  “I  remember  hearing  the  creak  of  the  door,  and  looking  behind  me  and  seeing  a  hand  go  out  reaching  for  the  bowl,”  Berl  says.  “And   that  was  it.”   Every  year  since  then,  Berl  would  inquire  after  Klueger.  He  learned  that  Klueger  was  a  Belzer  Chassid  before  the  war,  and  that  his  family  had  lived  next  to  one  of  the  town’s  synagogues.  Two  years  ago,  Berl  was  told  that  the  elderly  Jew  had  been  taken  from  his  home  and  placed  in  a  local  hospital.  He  died  this  month  at  the  age  of  72  —   the  last  Jew  of  Auschwitz.   Berl,  just  by  chance,  was  there  to  bury  him  on  a  sunny  June  afternoon  a  little  over  two  weeks  ago.  He  was  there  along  with  34  high  school  stu  dents  from  the  Ramaz  Upper  School  in  New  York  City,  tracing  modem  Jewish  history  among  the  cemeteries,  death  camps  and  desolate  syna  gogues  of  Poland.   “The  townspeople  knew  Klueger  was  a  Jew,  and  they  knew  there  was  a  rabbi  in  Krakow,”  Berl  recalls.  “So  when  he  died,  they  called  the  rabbi  —  his  name  is  Sasha  —  who  knew  I  was  in  the  area  with  a  group  of  religious  kids  from  New  York.  He  tracked  us  down  on  a  bus  some  four  hours  out  of  Krakow.”   The  kids  felt  we  had  to  do  something  for  him,  and  that  burying  him  with  a   minyan  would  be  a  beautiful  thing.""   The  group  was  asked  to  go  to  Auschwitz  to  make  a  minyan  and  give  the  man  a  Halachic  Jewish  burial.  The  Krakow  rabbi,  a  young  rabbi  who  had  not  yet  had  experience  ritually  prepar  ing  a  body  for  burial,  was  walked  through  the  process—via  mobile  phone  —  by  Vicky  Berglas,  a  historian  for  the  group  who  is  a  member  of  the  Chevra  Kadisha  in  Kamei  Shomron.  Although  it  was  close  to  Shabbat,  the  group  decided  to  make  the  journey  to  Auschwitz  to  bury  Klueger.   “Berl  asked  if  there  was  anybody  on  the  bus  who  didn’t  want  to  do  this,”  said  Benjamin  Yunis,  a  17-year  old  Ramaz  student.  “Nobody  raised   their  hand.”   As  to  why  he  was  interested  in  going  four  hours  out  of  his  way  to  bury  a  man  he  never  heard  of  or  laid  eyes  on,  Yunis  says:  “I  thought  it  was  the  right  thing  to  do.  The  least  that  we  could   do  for  the  last  Jew  in  Auschwitz  was  give  him  a  proper  Jewish  burial.”   TTie  Jewish  community  in  the  southern  Polish  village  of  Oswiecim  was  founded  in  middle  of  the  16th  century.  In  1921  it  numbered  5000,  consti  tuting  40  percent  of  the  town’s  population.   When  Berl  and  his  group  arrived  at  the  old  Jewish  cemetery  in  Auschwitz,  there  were  a  cou  ple  of  non-Jewish  townspeople  on  hand,  a.  Jew  from  a  neighbouring  village,  the  rabbi  from  Krakow  and  Polish  pall-bearers.  “They  wore  these  strange  looking  black  capes  and  hats,”  Berl  says  of  the  pallbearers.  “It  looked  like  it  was  something  out  of  the  Middle  Ages.  We  got  off  the   bus,  had  a  rabbi  with  us,  and  took  over  from  there.""   The  students,  says  the  Ramaz  rabbi  accompa  nying  the  group,  Yossi  Weiser,  wanted  to  bury  Klueger.  “Michael  [Berl]  told  us  on  the  bus  the  man’s  story,  how  he  hadn’t  left  his  house  in  years,  was  a  broken  person,  a  tortured  soul,”  says  Weiser.  “Obviously,  he  was  haunted  by  what  he  saw.  One  can  only  imagine  what  this  poor  man  was  thinking.  The  kids  felt  we  had  to  do  something  for  him,  and  that  burying  him  with  a  minyan  would  be  a  beautiful  thing.”   The  students  lifted  the  coffin,  placed  it  into  the  ground  and  threw  clay  onto  the  casket.  The  rabbi  gave  a  brief  eulogy.  The  El  Maleh  Rahamim  prayer  was  chanted,  followed  by  Kaddish.   “The  Kabbala  speaks  about  gathering  the  sparks  of  holiness,”  Weiser  says.  “When  you  go  to  Poland  and  see  evidence  of  unfinished  lives  that  were  not  brought  to  completion,  when  you  go  into  the  old  shules  where  things  are  ruined,  you  feel  that  there  is  holiness  lying  around  that  has  to  be  picked  up  and  brought  to  its  comple  tion.  Like  this  man,  something  had  to  be  done  to  bring  things  full-circle.  That  he  had  more  than  30  Jewish  youths  by  his  grave  who  will  now  remem  ber  him  —  that  was  something.”   Berl,  who  has  travelled  to  Poland  more  than  20  times,  says  the  experience  “knocked  me  out.  I  was  helping  perform  a  Jewish  ritual  that  will  never  again  be  performed  in  this  city.  There  will  never  be  another  Jewish  burial  in  Oswiecim.  It  means  that  the  door  is  closed  on  this  town—fin  ished.  Another  door  in  the  history  of  Polish  Jewry  has  been  slammed  shut.”   Jerusalem  Post ",2000-06-23
"  VIEWPOINT   INANE   ARMSTRONG   JUSTINE’S  voice  sparkled  with  excitement.  “It’s  going  to  be  fantastic,  Mum,’  she  told  me.  “We  had  our  meeting  last  night  about  the  float  for  the  Mardi  Gras.  We’ve  got  more  people  wanting  to  be  involved  than  we  expected,  which  is  great.  We’re  going  to  wear  T-shirts  with  Magen  Davids  on  them  and  we’re  learning  a  dance  routine.”   There  would  be  some  parents  and  heterosex  ual  supporters  joining  them.  “Naturally,  I’d  love  you  to  take  part  too,  and  I  think  you’d  have  a  lot  of  fun,  but  I’ll  understand  if  you  don’t  want  to,”   she  added.   My  heart  was  already  hammering,  and  I  could  feel  my  hands  trembling.  The  idea  of  walking  through  the  streets  of  Sydney  in  the  Gay  and  Lesbian  Mardi  Gras  as  part  of  a  noticeably  Jewish  group  pressed  all  my  panic  buttons.  I  spent  my  childhood  in  Poland  during  and  after  the  Holocaust  having  to  conceal  the  fact  that  I  was  Jewish,  and  this  has  left  me  with  a  lifelong  anxiety  about  publicly  parading  my  Jewish  iden  tity.  Being  Jewish  was  something  you  didn’t  advertise  in  public,  but  kept  private  and  invisi   ble.   I'd  always  thought  of  the  Mardi  Gras  Parade  as  flamboyant,  raunchy  and   dominated  by  exactly  the  wrong  kind  of  people   Like  having  a  gay  child.  In  any  case,  I’d  always  thought  of  the  Mardi  Gras  Parade  as  flamboyant,  raunchy  and  dominated  by  exactly  the  wrong  kind  of  people,  the  ones  who  reinforce  the  worst  stereotypes  of  homosexuals.  It  seemed  to  me  that  it  attracted  those  who  came  to  gawk  and  giggle  at  the  weird  participants,  outlandish  cos  tumes  and  bare  flesh.  There  was  no  way  I  was  going  to  be  part  of  that.   A  week  or  so  later,  my  son  Jonathan  asked  me  what  I  thought  about  taking  part  as  a  supporter,  as  he  has  done  for  the  past  three  years.  He  lis  tened  patiently  while  I  explained  my  reasons,  and  then  said:  “I  think  it’s  important  for  families  to  take  part  to  show  their  support.  If  more  rela  tives  and  friends  join  the  parade,  people  will  realise  that  gays  are  normal  people  with  normal  families  who  care  about  them.”   From  that  moment  on,  my  mind  churned  as  I  struggled  with  the  dilemma.  On  one  hand,  I  clung  to  my  views  and  anxieties,  but  at  the  same  time,  I  sensed  that  Jonathan  was  right.  But  the  more  I  thought  and  agonised,  the  more  I  went  around  in  circles.  Nothing  was  getting  resolved.   Four  days  before  the  Mardi  Gras,  I  happened  to  be  at  Bondi  Beach,  hovering  on  the  edge  of  the  water,  wincing  with  every  freezing  splash,  until  suddenly  I  stopped  worrying  how  cold  the  water  would  feel  and  just  plunged  in.  When  1  got  home,  I  decided  to  stop  thinking  about  it.  All  my  opinions  and  feelings  were  valid,  but  I  wanted  to  be  with  my  daughter,  find  that’s  what  I  was  going  to  do.  And  since  the  thought  of  wearing  a  Star  of  David  on  my  T-shirt  made  my  chest  tighten  with   apprehension,  I  wouldn’t  wear  it.   In  the  late  afternoon  of  the  day  of  the  parade,  as  we  walked  through  the  city  towards  our  meet  ing-point,  1  was  struck  by  the  terrific  atmosphere  of  camaraderie  between  the  bystanders  and  the  participants.  I  had  plenty  of  time  to  wander  around,  chat  with  other  people  and  admire  the  creative  floats  and  intricate  costumes.  But  when  I  came  back  to  our  float  and  saw  the  hot-pink  Magen  David  placards  that  most  of  our  group  were  holding,  my  stomach  knotted  with  appre   hension.   Finally,  the  parade  began.  There  seemed  to  be  quite  a  few  religious  floats,  and  as  they  passed  us,  Catholics,  Uniting  Church  members  and  Quakers  waved  to  us  and  called  out  friendly  comments.  Jonathan  pointed  to  the  banner  on   the  Koori  float,  which  was  about  Aboriginal  rec  onciliation  and  diversity,  and  it  struck  me  that  this  was  what  this  whole  parade  was  really  about  —  acceptance  of  our  human  differences  and  a  celebration  of  diversity.   Finally,  it  was  our  turn  to  move  off.  1  felt  a  surge  of  excitement  as  the  truck  with  its  huge  Magen  David,  and  the  infectious  beat  of  Havenu  Shalom  Aleichem,  began  moving  along  the  city  street.  Behind  the  truck  came  our  lively  dancers,  whose  pink  placards  made  a  distinctive  but  tasteful  black-and-pink  pattern  of  colour  and  movement  as  they  danced  down  Oxford  Street.  Right  in  the  very  front,  dancing  her  feet  off,  eyes  shining,  was  Justine,  obviously  having  the  time  of  her  life,  dancing  beside  her  partner,  Lucie.   In  front  of  me,  a  sea  of  pink  placards  in  the  shape  of  Stars  of  David  bobbed  joyously  in  time   Jewish  participants  in  the  Sydney  Mardi  Gras.   to  the  music.  Now  it  was  our  turn,  and  i  took  a   deep  breath  as  our  supporters’  group  turned  into  Oxford  Street.  How  would  the  bystanders   react  to  us?   All  around  us,  down  the  entire  length  of  Oxford  Street,  crowds  had  lined  up  as  much  as  ten  deep,  just  waiting  to  see  us.  Walking  beside  me  with  a  banner  that  said  “Proud  Brother”,  Jonathan  pointed.  Above  us,  every  window,  bal  cony  and  roof-top  was  crammed  with  people  leaning  out,  craning  their  heads,  hanging  out  of  every  building.  And  as  we  passed,  they  waved,  clapped,  cheered,  swayed  in  time  to  the  music  and  called  out  “Happy  Mardi  Gras!""  Those  stand  ing  in  the  street  tried  to  shake  our  hands.  We  could  feel  goodwill  and  warmth  reaching  out  to  us  in  the  most  accepting  and  powerful  sensation  of  solidarity  and  acceptance  I’ve  ever  felt.   What  made  this  even  more  exhilarating  was  that  apart  from  walking  beside  my  son,  I  had  two  of  my  closest  friends  there  as  well,  jumping  up  and  down  with  excitement.  We  couldn’t  stop  saying  incredulously:  “Isn’t  this  amazing!”   As  I  waved  back  to  the  cheering  crowds,  shook  the  hands  that  reached  out  to  me,  and  wished  them  “Happy  Mardi  Gras”  in  return,  I  felt  euphoric.  This  felt  like  a  victory  march,  a  ticker   tape  parade.  And  in  a  sense,  that’s  what  it  was.  A  collective  victory  for  the  Jewish  gays  and  les  bians  who  were  breaking  down  sexual  and  reli  gious  barriers.  But  for  me,  it  was  a  personal  vic  tory  as  well  because  1  was  overcoming  decades  of  anxieties  —  anxieties  about  showing  that  1  was  Jewish  and  about  having  a  gay  child.  Coming  out,  you  might  say.   As  he  waved  happily  to  the  crowds,  Jonathan  suddenly  said:  “Tonight  1  feel  really  proud  to  be  Jewish”.  I  felt  choked  up.  After  all  the  persecu  tion  I’ve  lived  through,  to  see  him  walking  so  confidently  among  this  throng,  to  have  my  daughter  choose  to  march  as  a  Jew  in  this  parade,  and  for  me  to  be  marching  with  them,  was  absolutely  miraculous.   1  felt  proud  of  my  daughter,  who  has  the  courage  to  stand  up  for  herself  and  the  leader  ship  to  inspire  others,  proud  of  my  son  who  stands  up  for  what  he  believes  in,  and  proud  of  my  husband  who  supports  us  all.  Proud  too  of  this  city  which,  with  bigoted  exceptions,  has  taken  this  celebration  of  diversity  to  its  big   heart.   ■  Diane  Armstrong  is  a  Sydney  writer  and  the   author  of  Mosaic.

"  Letters   Admitting  one’s  Jewish  heritage   THE  AJN  of  4/2/00  contained  two  arti  cles  of  more  than  usual  interest.  They  related  to  two  eminent  figures  with  Australian  Jewish  backgrounds,  one  assimilated  and  the  other  very  much  identified  with  his  origins.   The  first  is  Sir  Gustav  Nossal,  Australian  of  the  Year,  and  the  latter  Rabbi  Dr  Shimon  Cowen,  eldest  son  of  Sir  Zelman  Cowen.  He  is  a  Lubavitch  Jew,  combining  love  of  Judaism  with  secular  knowledge,  particularly  mod  em  social  philosophy.  He  seeks  to  combat  assimilation  through  outreach  to  those  lured  away  from  Judaism.   By  contrast,  eminent  scientist  Sir  Gustav  Nossal  is  the  scion  of  an  Austrian  Jewish  family  which  migrated  in  1939  to  Australia.  His  grandparents  left  the  Jewish  fold  to  join  the  Catholic  Church.  Sir  Gustav’s  father  was  bap  tised  as  a  Lutheran.  His  sons,  including  Sir  Gustav,  attended  Catholic  schools  and  married  Catholic  girls.   Jewish  readers,  no  less  than  others,  express  goodwill  and  congratulations  to  Sir  Gustav.  He  has  the  right  to  feel  pride  in  his  Jewish  lineage,  which  he  first  began  to  value  as  a  professor  at  Stanford  University,  where  he  found  that  virtually  all  the  famous  professors   and  Nobel  laureates  were  Jewish.   Your  reporter  Stefan  Bialoguski  sug  gests  that  “perhaps  it  is  the  genetic  memory  passed  through  his  father’s  lineage  that  has  left  Sir  Gustav  sharing  the  Jewish  affiliation  for  learning,  right  eousness  and  justice”;  Sir  Gustav  is  much  concerned  with  the  need  for  rec  onciliation  and  improvement  of  the  condition  of  the  Aboriginal  people.   This  is  by  no  means  the  first  time  that  what  is  loosely  referred  to  as  the  “Jewish  heritage”  of  leading  Australians  is  raised.  A  non-Jew  recently  spoke  of  a  Jewish  judge  in  such  terms;  a  political  activist  was  reported  as  claiming  that  this  heritage  was  appropriate  to  his   work.   The  ethos  of  tolerance  and  accept  ance  of  diversity  have  made  it  easier  for  Australian  Jews  to  practise  their  reli  gion.  However,  Judaism  derives  from  the  Torah.  Non-Jews,  however  well  meaning,  are  not  heirs  of  the  Torah.  It  is  one  thing  for  a  person  to  recognise  Jewish  genes  in  his  or  her  make-up,  it  is  another  when  such  a  person  has  no  direct  affiliation  with  the  Jewish  com  munity  and  remains  aloof  from  it.   The  lesson  of  history  shows  that  Judaism  has  survived  because  of  the  sacrifices  which  were  made.  If,  as  a  Roman  theologian  said,  “the  blood  of   the  martyrs  is  the  seed  of  the  Church"",  how  much  more  so,  sad  though  it  be,  is  this  true  of  Judaism.   Chanukah  is  not  alone  in  demon  strating  how  our  forbears  resisted  the  tyranny  of  hostile  civilisations,  result  ing  in  victory  of  the  few  against  the  many.  It  has  always  been  necessary  to  distinguish  between  Jewish  integration  with  society  and  the  process  of  assimi  lation  in  abandoning  Jewish  roots.   Your  reporter  is  commended  on  his  perception  “of  a  family  history  that  embraces  the  greatest  tragedies  to  befall  modem  Jewry:  the  Holocaust  and  assimilation”.  No  admiration  for  a  personality  can  mask  the  concern  of  Jews  for  the  losses  incurred  by  assimi  lation.  The  text  in  Song  of  Solomon  —  “They  made  me  keeper  of  the  vine  yards;  but  my  own  vineyard  have  I  not  kept”  —  is  a  reference  to  those  who  leave  the  Jewish  faith.   We  may  rejoice  that  there  are  many  who  happily  acknowledge  their  Jewish  heritage,  yet  it  is  regrettable  in  the  extreme  that  so  much  talent  has  been  lost  to  Jewry  because  of  those  who  pre  ferred  the  path  of  assimilation.

"  The  Jewish-gav  issue:  The  debate  continues   JUDAISM  and  the  rabbinate  do  not  criticise  lifestyles,  per  se.

By  engaging  in  and  supporting  the  flaunting  of  lifestyles  which  denigrate  family  values,  those  who  openly  support  homosexual  activities  are  rebuilding  the  gas  chambers  of  the  Holocaust,  as  potential  future  generations  would  not  eventu   ate.   Some  “members”  —  I  dispute  their  right  to  be  called  Jews  because  of  this  —  of  the  community  have  been  deceived  into  joining  a  casual  “feel  good”  lifestyle,  which  is  renowned  for  being  prone  to  immunity  deficiencies.  Those  activities  are  akin  to  missionaries  and  other  conversionary  attempts,  all  undermining  of  Jewish  communal   values.   But  the  tum-up  now  comes  from  within  the  community  with  the  open  support  of  so-called  community  leaders”,  many  of  whom  have  com  pletely  misunderstood  the  issues.  Judaism  always  supports  the  underdog,  but  not  when  the  underdog  becomes  a  cancer  or  a  disease  —  just  as  Jews  supported  nationalism  until  it  started  to   attack  them.   The  above  is  not  intended  to  criticise  those  who,  for  physical  or  chemical  reasons,  are  attracted  to  same-sex  relationships.  It  is  intended  to  criticise  those  who  either  unthinkingly,  or  with  intent,  support  and  promote  the  blatant  attempt  to  undermine  our  religions  principles.  Judaism  is  a  whole-life  religion,  not  a  weekend  belief.   Joe  Newman   North  Bondi,  NSW ",2000-04-07
"  Lieberman:  Black-Jewish  tensions  revive   Sharon  Santhsr   WASHINGTON:  Senator  Joseph  Lieberman’s  attempts  last  week  to  allay  the  concerns  of  some  black  lead  ers  about  his  position  on  affirmative  action  showed  political  nous  —  but  also  demonstrated  that  old  tensions  die  hard.   Despite  a  sense  that  ties  between  Jews  and  blacks  have  improved  in  recent  years,  the  Democratic  vice  presidential  candidate’s  emergence  into  the  public  spotlight  has  revived  issues  of  contention  —  and  revived  concerns  about  black  antisemitism.   Lieberman  had  to  clarify  his  posi   tion  on  affirmative  action  to  the  Democratic  National  Committee’s  Black  Caucus  as  soon  as  he  arrived  in  Los  Angeles  for  the  convention.  “I  have  supported  affirmative  action,  I  do  support  affirmative  action  and  I  will  support  affirmative  action,”  he  told  the  group.   And  in  his  acceptance  speech,  he  said  he  favoured  President  Bill  Clinton’s  “mend  it,  don’t  end  it”  approach  to  affirmative  action.   Democratic  Congresswoman  Maxine  Waters,  who  led  the  fight  to  force  Lieberman  to  explain  his  posi  tion,  seemed  appeased.  The  outspo  ken  congresswoman  said  she  felt  bet  ter  after  the  issue  had  been  clarified.   Lieberman  and  other  Democratic   officials  also  touted  the  senator’s  long  record  of  support  for  civil  rights:  he  travelled  to  Mississippi  in  the  1960s  to  register  black  voters,  while  in  the  Senate  he  voted  to  continue  affirma  tive  action  programs  in  1995,  and  three  years  later  helped  to  stop  the  elimination  of  a  federal  program  that  helps  women  and  minorities  win  high  way  construction  contracts.   While  he  did  indicate  his  support  for  California’s  Proposition  209  —  a  1996  failed  initiative  that  would  have  abolished  state-funded  affirmative  action  programs,  Lieberman  has  said  he  did  not  agree  with  its  details  and  never  endorsed  the  legislation.  At  the  same  time,  he  has  said  he  is  troubled  by  racial  quotas.   The  Democratic  platform  makes  it  clear  that  Gore  opposes  efforts  to  roll  back  affirmative  action  programs.   While  Lieberman  seemed  to  assuage  the  concerns  of  many  party  blacks,  the  incident  brought  to  the  surface  an  issue  that  has  long  been  a  point  of  contention  between  blacks   and  Jews.   Murray  Friedman,  an  American  Jewish  historian  and  author  of  What  Went  Wrong:  The  Creation  and  Collapse  of  the  Black-Jewish  Alliance,  said  there  was  a  feeling  in  the  black  community  years  ago  that  Jewish  agencies  stood  in  the  way  of  affirma   tive  action.   In  the  landmark  1977  case  of  Regents  of  the  University  of  California  versus  Bakke,  the  Supreme  Court  found  that  race  can  be  considered  as  a  factor  in  the  medical  school  admis  sions  process,  but  cannot  be  the  deciding  factor.   The  Anti-Defamation  League,  the  American  Jewish  Committee  and  the  American  Jewish  Congress  all  filed   Vice-presidential  candidate  Joseph  Ueberman  addresses  the  Black  Caucus  In  Los  Angeles.   Photo:  JTA   briefs  in  support  of  the  white  medical  student  applicant  (Bakke)  who  had  challenged  the  racial  quota  system.   Today,  affirmative  action  remains  a  difficult  issue  within  the  Jewish  com  munity.  The  Orthodox  Union,  for  example,  is  more  sympathetic  to  a   class-based  model  of  affirmative  action  rather  than  a  race-based  one,  according  to  Nathan  Diament,  the  director  of  its  Institute  for  Public  Affairs.  The  group  eschews  quotas  and  supports  assistance  to  people   Tensions  could  keep  ebbing  and  flowing  as  antisemitic  remarks  come  from  parts  of  the  black  community,  say   observers.   based  on  individual  need,  rather  than  membership  in  a  particular  racial  and  ethnic  group.   While  there  are  nuanced  differences   among  Jewish  organisations,  the  con  sensus  appears  to  support  “properly  structured”  affirmative  action  policies,  according  to  a  two-year  study  by  the  Jewish  Council  for  Public  Affairs.  The  study  found  a  range  of  opinions  in  the  community  on  affirmative  action.  But  the  majority,  according  to  the  study,  support  “policies  or  programs  that  consider  race  as  one  among  many  rel  evant  factors,  that  accept  or  reward  only  individuals  judged  to  be  quali  fied,  and  that  do  not  include  quotas”.   Meanwhile,  Lieberman  is  receiving  support  from  prominent  black  leaders  and  organisations.  Civil  rights  leader  Jesse  Jackson  took  the  opportunity  to  turn  the  issue  around  as  he  told  a  cheering  crowd  at  the  convention  that  “Gore  ended  the  quota  of  zero  of  Jewish  Americans  on  the  national  tick  et  last  week.  This  was  a  bold  act  of  affirmative  action.”   Perhaps  trying  to  halt  further  dam  age,  veteran  civil  rights  leader   Democratic  Congressman  John  Lewis  said:  “We  need  a  man  like  Joe  Lieberman  to  walk  with  us”.   In  the  National  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Coloured  People  Legislative  Report  Card  on  the  106th  Congress,  Lieberman  received  100  percent  for  his  voting  record  on  civil  rights  issues.  Julian  Bond,  chairman  of  the  NAACP’s  board  of  directors,  said  American  Jews  have  been  more  sup  portive  of  civil  rights  than  have  other  non-minority  Americans.   The  affirmative  action  issue  will   probably  die  down  and  won’t  spark  a  renewal  of  tensions,  most  experts  agree.  “I  don’t  see  this  as  a  dominant  issue  at  the  moment,”  said  Friedman,  who  heads  the  American  Jewish  Committee  office  in  Philadelphia.   Julius  Lester,  a  Professor  of  Judaic  and  Near  Eastern  Studies  at  the  University  of  Massachusetts,  said  he  thinks  tensions  between  the  two   groups  have  diminished.  “In  my  trav  els  around  the  country,  1  find  blacks  are  more  curious  about  Judaism,  that  more  blacks  are  converting  to  Judaism,  and  this  is  in  contrast  to  very  different  attitudes  I  encountered  a  decade  ago,”  said  Lester,  an  African  American  who  converted  to  Judaism  years  ago.   A  clear  indication  of  the  change,  Lester  says,  was  the  response  of  the  NAACP  to  the  leader  of  the  Dallas  chapter  who  made  antisemitic  remarks  about  Lieberman  being  the  vice-presidential  nominee.  The  NAACP  immediately  denounced  the  comments  Lee  Alcorn  made,  and  Alcorn  was  forced  to  resign.  “My  own   sense  is  that  tensions  between  blacks  and  Jews  is  at  its  lowest  in  quite  some  time,”  Lester  said.   But  according  to  a  1998  Anti  Defamation  League  poll  of  Americans’  attitudes  about  Jews,  blacks  are  three  times  more  likely  to  hold  antisemitic  beliefs  than  whites  are.   That  finding  of  growing  anti  semitism  among  blacks  is  challenged  by  Rabbi  Marc  Schneier,  president  of  the  Foundation  for  Ethnic  Understanding,  which  works  to  foster  relations  between  Jews  and  blacks.  A  1998  poll  by  the  organisation  sur  veyed  500  Jews  and  500  blacks  and  found  growing  co-operation  between  the  groups.   According  to  Abraham  Foxman,  the  ADL’s  national  director,  the  polls  are  not  comparable  because  of  the  way  they  were  conducted.  He  said  he  wished  the  foundation’s  survey  con   elusions  were  right,  and  that  his  group  was  so  troubled  by  the  findings  of  the  ADL  survey  that  it  doubled  the  sam  ples  twice  —  and  still  got  the  same  results.  “It’s  a  very  distressing,  dis  turbing  statistic,”  he  said.   Indeed,  tensions  could  keep  ebbing  and  flowing  as  antisemitic  remarks  come  from  parts  of  the  black  commu  nity,  say  observers.   The  latest  incident  was  an  editorial  in  the  Amsterdam  News  —  a  major  black  newspaper  in  New  York  City  —  which  suggested  that  Gore  bought  the  Jewish  vote  by  selecting  Lieberman  as  his  running  mate.   Schneier  views  the  remarks  as  exceptions  to  the  rule.  “We  must  dis  tance  ourselves  from  the  rhetoric  and  diatribe  of  a  few  who  look  to  exacer  bate  tensions  between  our  two  com  munities,”  he  said.

"  Jewish  leaders   “Christian  values”   Bernard  Rreedsnan   JEWISH  community  leaders  have  chal  lenged  the  right  of  church  organisations  acting  as  federal  job  agencies  to  ignore  anti-discrimination  laws  and  say  they  will  employ  only  those  people  with  “Christian   values”.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  acting  president  Jo  Gostin  said  that  “the  ECAJ  will  definitely  write  to  the  govern  ment  seeking  clarification  about  what  the  parameters  will  be  in  the  employment   process.   “If  there  are  going  to  be  guidelines  estab  lished  by  these  organisations  and  they  are  specific  on  Christian  values  we  will  protest  very  definitely.”   Jewish  community  concern  follows  recent  published  comments  from  Wesley  Mission  public  relations  manager  David  McGovern,  which  Sydney  solicitor  and  Woollahra  Labor  councillor  George  Newhouse  condemned  as  “offensive  and  bigoted”  and  the  sort  of  argument  “you  would  expect  to  hear  from  a  white   supremacist”.   In  an  article  published  in  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald  this  month,  Mr  McGovern  said  organisations  like  the  Wesley  Mission  had  long  maintained  a  policy  of  having  “Christian  belief”  as  an  occupational  requirement.  This  was  because  they  had  found  that  “Christians  make  the  best  staff”,  would  “do  their  job  better”,  were  not  moti  vated  solely  by  money  and  were  “often  will  ing  to  go  that  extra  mile”.   Continued  page  4   George  Newhouse   Jewish  leaders  challenge  “Christian  values”   Continued  from  page  3   Employment  Services  Minister  Tony  Abbott  subsequently  inflamed  the  controversy  when  he  defended  the  right  of  church  organisations  to  “uphold  their  own  ethos”  by  employ  ing  people  holding  Christian  beliefs.   The  Wesley  Mission  is  one  of  at  least  four  major  Christian  organisa  tions  to  have  won  contracts  poten  tially  worth  a  total  of  $1.5  billion  as  job  placement  agencies  under  the  federal  government’s  privatised  Job  Network  program.   The  Christian  agencies  —  Salvation  Army  Employment  Plus,  Mission  Australia,  Centacare  Australia  Ltd  and  Wesley  Uniting  Employment—are  among  the  top  20  successful  tenderers  for  Job  Network  agencies.  The  Salvation  Army  and  Mission  Australia  head  the  list,  each  with  potential  incomes  running  into   hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.   Victorian  Supreme  Court  Justice  Howard  Nathan:  “This  proposal  invites  almost  certain  constitutional  challenge.  Separation  of  church  and  state  is  one  of  the  constitutional  prin  ciples  we  imported  from  the  United  States  and  they,  in  turn,  imported  as  a  product  of  the  Enlightenment.   “This  is  a  principle  we  should  be  vigilant  in  upholding  and  Section  116  of  our  Constitution,  although  not  as  direct  as  its  American  parent,  does   prohibit  religious  tests  for  the  hold  ing  of  public  office.   “Where  the  government  authoris  es  religious  bodies  to  operate  some  of  its  functions,  it  cannot  permit  the  carrying  out  of  these  functions  to  be  proscribed  by  religious  belief  or  lack  of  it.  Preservation  of  public  harmony  suggests  it  would  be  best  either  to  abandon  the  proposal  or  for  the  organisations  to  expand  the  cate  gories  of  people  they  intend  to  employ.”   New  South  Wales  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  acting  president  Amanda  Gordon:  “Christians  don’t  have  a  stranglehold  on  the  values  that  make  the  best  employers  or  employees.  Arguments  that  Christians  make  the  best  employees  are  ingredients  that  can  lead  to  bigotry  and  hatred.   “I  don’t  argue  against  the  rights  of  Christian  organisations  to  employ  Christians  in  church  work  or  other  religious  activities.  They  are  perfect  ly  entitled  to  do  so  just  as  Jewish  organisations  employ  Jews  in  activi  ties  connected  with  their  faith.  If  the  churches  can  act  in  a  secular  man  ner,  well  and  good.  But  if  they  see  the  jobs  placement  program  as  part  of  their  religious  ministry,  then  the  gov  ernment  should  not  be  giving  them   funds.   “There  should  be  no  discrimina  tion  on  religious  grounds  in  the  way  they  select  staff  otherwise  non   Christians  are  not  going  to  get  a  look   in.   “It  will  be  vital  to  monitor  the  situ  ation  and  politicians  should  be  receptive  to  the  views  of  their  elec  torate  on  this  issue.  There  is  a  need  for  a  change  in  the  law  to  ensure  that  the  freedom  from  anti-discrimination  legislation  enjoyed  by  religious  organisations  does  not  extend  to  their  role  as  employers  in  job  place   ment.""   Meanwhile,  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunities  Commissioner  Chris  Sidoti  backed  Labor  and  the  Australian  Democrats  who  want  leg  islation  to  outlaw  discrimination  by  employment  agencies  run  by  reli  gious  organisations.   At  present,  the  federal  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunity  Commission  Act  allows  religious  organisations  to  discriminate  “to  avoid  injury  to  the  religious  suscepti  bilities  of  adherents”  of  a  religion  or   creed.   And  a  warning  tetter  has  reported  ly  been  sent  from  the  Employment,  Workplace  Relations  and  Small  Business  Department  to  Job  Network  agencies  reminding  them  that  clause  13  of  their  contracts  requires  them  to  provide  Job  Network  services  “with  out  any  unlawful  discrimination”.   ■  Seepage  11 ",2000-01-21
"  Breathing  life  into  Jewish  practice   ShiraSebban   HOW  Jewish  your  children  will  be  depends  on  your  family  environment.  Parents  who  don’t  maintain  a  Jewish  home  shouldn’t  be  disappointed  if  their  children  “don’t  internalise  a  Jewish  identity  and  make  a  commit  ment  to  Jewish  living”.   American  Professor  Ron  Wolfson  has  devoted  years  to  promoting  Jewish  family  education.  “Kids  may  learn  about  Judaism  at  school,  but  what’s  the  point  if  they  don’t  have  any  Jewish  life  at  home?”  he  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.  “What  works  is  a  combination  of  family  first,  school  and  synagogue.  All  studies  of  Jewish   identity  say  that  the  family  is  the  pri  mary  influence  on  how  Jewish  your  children  will  be.   “That’s  not  to  say  that  school,  youth  groups  and  trips  to  Israel  aren’t  important.  They’re  crucial  because  the  family  can’t  do  it  alone.  But  I  don’t  understand  it,  if  everyone  runs  to  syn  agogue  all  day  on  Rosh  Hashana  and  Yom  Kippur,  and  comes  home  to  no  Shabbat  or  Jewish  conversation.”   Revitalising  synagogues  is  another  of  Professor  Wolfson’s  concerns.  “When  people  say  they’re  looking  for  spiritual  expression  or  community,  we  understand  them  to  want  to  answer  what  we  call  the  four  questions  of  Jewish  spirituality:  What  is  the  mean  ing  of  my  life?  What  am  I  supposed  to  be  doing  besides  making  money  and  raising  a  family?  What  is  my  connec  tion  to  a  community?  Where  is  God’s  presence  in  my  life?   “Synagogues  ought  to  be  communi  ties  where  these  questions,  if  not  answered,  at  least  have  people  who  can  help  you  begin  to  answer  them.  They’re  places  where  people  are  com  mitted  to  finding  spiritual  purpose  and  a  sense  of  God.”   Since  1996,  Professor  Wolfson  has  been  running  “Synagogue  2000:  A  Trans-Denominational  Project  for  the  Synagogue  of  the  21st  Century”  (S2K),  together  with  Liturgy  Professor  and  Rabbi  Larry  Hoffman,  whom  he  calls  “one  of  the  world’s  experts  on  Jewish  worship”.   They  are  currently  working  with  45  synagogues  across  the  US,  each  of  which  has  created  a  team  represent  ing  clergy,  lay  leaders  and  members  on  the  periphery.  Each  team  commits  to  meeting  at  least  once  a  month  for  three  years  to  discuss  and  act  on  six   issues  —  prayer,  change,  study,  good  deeds  and  social  justice,  the  ambience  of  a  welcoming  community,  and  heal  ing.  “In  many  synagogues,  the  regulars  feel  comfortable,  but  strangers  are  ignored.  We’ve  found  that  people  need  training  in  how  to  welcome  people.”   While  most  synagogues  have  a  small  core  of  regulars,  the  challenge  is  to  attract  more  people,  he  said.  “Our  approach  is  trans-ideological.  We’re  more  interested  in  strategies  than  in  getting  hung  up  on  differences  in  ide  ologies  ...  What  we’ve  learned  is  that  different  modes  of  worship  work  for  different  people.”   Bom  in  Omaha,  Nebraska,  Professor  Wolfson  grew  up  in  a  Conservative  household  and  was  active  in  his  local  synagogue  and  youth  group.  “As  I’ve  grown  older,  I’ve  come  to  respect  all  strands  of  Jewish  experience,  and  what  strikes  me  are  the  similarities  of  needs  expressed  across  the  spectrum.  Singing,  for  example,  is  one  of  the  windows  to  the  soul.  The  opportunity  to  sing  together  as  a  community  transcends  denomi  national  lines  and  is  an  opening  for  people  who  have,  in  the  past,  been  turned  off.  It’s  a  challenge  to  find  expe  riences  of  Jewish  worship  for  people,  who  don’t  have  access  skills  or  knowl  edge  of  tefilla  [prayer]  and  yet  are  looking  for  some  kind  of  authentic  experience  of  Jewish  prayer.”   Deciding  not  to  become  a  rabbi,  he  opted  to  specialise  in  Jewish  educa  tion  and  has  been  based  at  the  University  of  Judaism,  an  independent  school  of  higher  Jewish  learning  in  Los  Angeles,  for  the  past  25  years,  where  he  trains  teachers  at  all  levels,  from  early  childhood  through  high  school.  He  is  also  director  of  the   Professor  Ron  WoHson   Whizin  Centre  for  the  Jewish  Future.  An  academic  think-tank,  it  was  estab  lished  more  than  10  years  ago  to  focus  on  “what  we  believe  will  be  the  three  pillars  of  the  Jewish  community  in  the  21st  century:  family,  synagogue  and  Jewish  community”.   He  has  also  written  four  books,  known  as  The  Art  of  Jewish  Living  series,  which  aim  to  teach  Jewish  fam   ilies  how  to  celebrate  at  home.   His  advice  is  to  “take  Jewish  living   one  step  at  a  time.  For  most  Jews,  it’s  difficult  to  adopt  it  all  at  once  if  they  didn’t  grow  up  with  it  My  approach  to  Jewish  learning  is  one  of  empower  ment  I  want  to  give  people  informa  tion  about  traditional  Jewish  practice,  and  ideas  on  how  to  eliminate  obsta  cles  and  make  Judaism  come  alive  for  them  in  a  meaningful  way.”   The  website  for  Synagogue  2000  is  www.s2k.org ",2000-12-01
"  Personal  insight  into  Jewish  roots   Stefan  BlaBogUski   DANIELLA  Torsch  didn’t  even  know  that  she  was  Jewish  until  she  was  11.  Now,  a  “detective  hunt”  in  the  Czech  Republic  has  led  the  associ  ate  producer  of  SBS  Television’s  Insight  program  to  trace  many  aspects  of  her  personal  history.   Taking  a  year  off  to  trace  her  roots,  Ms  Torsch  travelled  from  her  home  in  Balmain  to  Berlin,  Brno  —  cultural  capital  of  Moravia  —  and  near  by  Boskovice,  where  her  family  once  lived,  and  was  pleasantly  surprised  by  the  size  and  confi  dence  of  the  Jewish  community  which  she  encountered  in  the  Czech  Republic.   “I'm  sure  a  lot  of  people  who  haven’t  been  to  the  Czech  Republic  since  the  war  would  get  a  shock  because  there’s  a  Jewish  presence  now  that  hasn’t  been  there  for  50  years,”  she  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  on  her  return.  “There’s  an  interest  in  Judaism  and  a  willingness  by  the  government  to  listen  to  the  community.  There’s  a  strong  and  proud  Jewish  presence  in  Prague  which  surprised  me;  to  find  it  in  Brno,  I  found  very  encouraging  ”   In  Bmo,  Ms  Torsch  met  historian  Jaroslav  Klenovsky  who,  although  not  Jewish,  is  an  expert  on  Jewish  sites  in  the  area  and  is  involved  in  a  major  exhibition  opening  on  December  18  called  Jewish  Moravia,  Jewish  Bmo.   “Mr  Klenovsky  was  very  generous.  He  gave  me  a  day  of  his  time  and  showed  me  around.  He  took  me  to  the  archives,  and  I  found  my  great  grandmother’s  address.  We  went  to  the  ceme  tery  and  I  was  able  to  find  my  great-grandfather’s  grave  more  quickly,  thanks  to  his  help  in  trans  lating  from  Czech  to  German.  He  did  a  lot  of  archival  research  for  me  before  I  even  arrived.”   The  Jewish  presence  in  Bmo  dates  back  to  the  13th  century.  Jews  were  expelled  in  1454  and   Danlella  Torsch  In  front  of  a  poster  promoting  the  Jewish  Moravia,  Jewish  Brno  exhibition.   banned  for  400  years,  returning  after  1848,  when  a  wave  of  liberalisation  swept  Europe.  The  Jewish  population  had  reached  12,000  by  1939  and  now  numbers  just  300.   The  trip  to  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  was  as  much  an  inner  journey  as  an  intercontinental  one  for  Ms  Torsch,  who  hopes  to  use  the  infor  mation  she  gathered  to  compile  a  family  history.  “My  family  came  to  Australia  in  1948.  My  parents  never  talked  about  their  background;  they  were  traumatised  by  the  Holocaust”   Ironically,  in  their  attempt  to  destroy  Jewish  civilisation  during  the  war,  the  Germans  and  their  Czech  collaborators  ended  up  saving  the   country’s  Judaica  by  emptying  synagogues  and  homes  and  taking  the  precious  artefacts  to  the  relative  security  of  Prague.  But  their  plans  to  stuff  the  Judaica  into  a  museum  depicting  an  extinct  culture  came  to  naught  The  exhibition  in  Bmo  is  part  of  a  larger  cultural  expo  which  includes  Jewish  theatre  and  classical  music  and   will  see  many  of  those  artefacts  “coming  home”  for  the  first  time  in  more  than  half-a-century.

Ms  Torsch:  “The  Czech  Republic  passed  a  law  this  year  that  gives  back  the  synagogues  and  the  cemeteries  to  the  Jewish  community.  It’s  a  mixed  blessing  because  the  community  has  no  money  and  a  lot  of  the  people  left  are  very  old  and  they  now  have  this  huge  responsibility.  Many  of  the  synagogues  are  beautiful,  but  in  a  shocking  condition  after  50  years  of   Communism.   “The  Diaspora  has  a  responsibility  not  only  to  Israel,  but  also  to  places  like  the  Czech  Republic,  where  money  is  in  very  limited  sup  ply.  They  are  struggling  to  recover  from  a  diffi  cult  period  of  Communism,  and  before  that,  Nazism.  In  helping  to  publicise  the  Bmo  exhibi  tion,  I  wanted  to  give  something  back.  I  have  got  back  a  lot  of  my  past,  thanks  to  people  like  Mr  Klenovsky,  and  I  want  to  give  something  back.” ",2000-11-24
"  A  Jewish  constitution?   BARAK’S  recent  announcement  of  the  establishment  of  a  working   group  to  draft  a  constitution  catapults  the  issue  of  religion  and   state  in  Israel  to  the  forefront  of  debate.   This  is  not  entirely  new.  The  Declaration  of  Independence,  Megillat  Atzma  ’ut  included  no  reference  to  God;  only  Rabbi  Maimon’s  signature,  included  the  letters  n""'ntj?2,  which  supplemented  the  concluding  compromise  phrase  to  the  effect  that  the  declaration  was  signed  with   trust  beTzur  Yisrael—in  the  Rock  of  Israel.   Ben-Gurion  established  the  so-called  status  quo,  which  determined  the  Jewish  flavour  of  the  modem  state.  Shabbat  and  festivals  were  official  holidays,  religious  authorities  continued  to  maintain  responsibility  for  personal  matters  including  marriage  and  divorce  (a  situation  in  existence  since  Ottoman  times)  and  there  were  provisions  established  for  army  exemptions  for  yeshivah  students  and  religious  girls.  There  were  two  government  educational  streams  (secular  and  religious),  and  a  ministry  was  established  for  religious  affairs.   For  three  decades,  the  Orthodox  —  and  particularly  those  not  associated  with  the  National  Religious  Party  or  modem  Orthodox  philosophies  —  limited  their  participation  in  state  activities.  They  lived  their  lives  on  a  semi-independent  baas,  laigely  ignoring  army  service  or  the  government  educational  streams,  funding  their  own  educational  initiatives  in  conjunction  with  finance  from  overseas.  As  nonne  wanted  to  engage  in  a  major  conflict,  a  modus  vivendi  developed,  although   tensions  surfaced  from  time  to  time.   Change  began  with  the  advent  of  the  1977  Begin  Government,  which  coincided  with  changing  demographics  in  the  Orthodox  community.   Practically  all  of  the  Orthodox  communities  saw  the  opportunities  to  use  increased  numbers  of  second  and  third  generation  haredi  voters  to  political  advantage.  After  all,  Orthodox  families  were  just  as  entitled  as   ""What  purpose  is  there  for  Israel  if  not  as  a  Jewish  state?  And  if  it  is  to  be  a  specifically  Jewish  state,  whose  Jewish   values  will  prevail?""   others  to  benefit  from  the  state-funded  education.  Given  that  they  had  larger  families,  why  shouldn’t  they  receive  increased  social  welfare  family  assistance  payments?   On  the  other  hand,  they  saw  no  need  to  change  the  army  exemption  clause,  even  though  numbers  had  increased  —  most  Western  countries  with  compulsory  military  service  exempted  theological  students.   Then  two  new  elements  entered  the  fray.  First,  the  religious  parties  in  government  became  increasingly  associated  with  right-wing  territorial  views;  second,  there  was  a  resurgence  of  Sephardi  pride  and  voting  power,  which  was  associated  with  more  traditional  religious  views.  That  Sephardi  political  orientation  was  also  partially  coloured  by  a  perception  that  the  Sephardi  immigrants  had  been  poorly  treated  in  the  early  years  of  the  state  by  a  disparaging  Eastern  European  elite  that  controlled  the  echelons  of  power.  Hence  the  power  of  Shas,  which  came  from  nowhere  to  become  the  third  largest  party  on  the  Israeli  political  spectrum  by  the  90s.   Unfortunately,  as  always,  matters  were  exacerbated  by  the  dominance  of  the  secular  media.  As  the  secular  and  middle-of-the-road  Israeli  public  awoke  to  the  changes,  they  realised  that  they  faced  a  loss  of  privileged  position  —  while  limitations  on  available  government  funds  meant  an  increasing  focus  on  those  seen  as  receiving  funds  while  not  fully  contributing  to  Israeli  society.  For  the  purpose  of  that  criticism,  Israeli  society  was  of  course  defined  in  pre-existing  and  largely  secular  terms.  Even  the  fact  that  Orthodox  values  encouraged  large  families  (with  concomitant  implications  for  the  welfare  budget)  was  criticised  —  despite  its  important  contribution  towards  demographic  balance  between  Jews  and  others  in  the  country  as  a  whole,  let  alone  in  Jerusalem.  Inevitably,  there  were  differences  between  those  who  chose  tire  supreme  value  of  Torah  over  military  service.   Those  who  attempted  to  bridge  the  divide  became  captives  of  coalition  politics;  the  lack  of  understanding  of  Orthodox  values  was  exacerbated  by  focusing  on  those  who  had  abused  the  privilege.  The  controversy  over  the  report  by  the  Tal  Commission  is  but  the  latest  chapter  in  this  saga.   Those  who  seek  to  draw  up  a  constitution  for  the  State  of  Israel  are  going  to  have  to  wrestle  with  balancing  democracy  with  religious  as  well  as  secular  values.  A  favoured  position  for  Judaism  cannot  be  compatible  with  pure  democracy  (if  such  exists);  yet  what  purpose  is  there  for  Israel  if  not  as  a  Jewish  state?  And  if  it  is  to  be  a  specifically  Jewish  state,  whose  Jewish  values  will  prevail?   Over  the  years  many  warned  that  once  Israel  resolves  its  outstanding  issues  with  its  neighbours,  the  real  battle  —  the  internal  one  —  would  begin.  Although  we  are  still  far  from  resolving  the  external  conflict,  it  appears  that  with  the  proposal  to  draw  up  a  constitution,  the  first  shots  in  the  internal  conflict  may  well  have  been  fired.

"  Opinion   Letters   news   I  WRITE  in  response  to  Wallace  Beakin’s  letter  claiming  that  the  Australian  Jewish  News  is  a  mouth  piece  of  the  Australian  Labor  Party.   The  Howard  government  has  prid  ed  itself  on  its  economic  manage  ment.  Most  conservative  people  would  probably  approve  of  this.  However,  its  social  policy  has  been  problematic  since  1996.  Its  attitudes  to  the  Aboriginal  people,  and  the  Stolen  Generation  in  particular,  have  been  heavy-handed,  insensitive  and   at  times  untruthful.  Prime  Minister  Howard’s  stubborn  refusal  to  offer  the  apology  requested  by  the  Council  for  Reconciliation  resulted  in  250,000  people  crossing  the  Harbour  Bridge  to  show  support  for  reconciliation.   Questions  of  basic  human  rights,  justice  and  fairness  are  news,  and  are  a  legitimate  topic  for  the  AJN.  Mr  Beakin  should  read  the  parts  which  interest  him  and  leave  those  that   don’t.  I  read  the  paper  every  week  and  skip  the  bits  which  don’t  interest  me,  just  as  I  do  with  the  daily  papers.   The  fact  that  Jewish/Aboriginal  interaction  occurs,  that  Jews  are  not  only  straight  but  gay,  that  Jews  are  involved  in  e-business,  that  Israel  has  been  a  host  to  Aboriginal  people  interested  in  seeing  how  communal  living  works  in  that  country,  are  all  legitimate  items  of  news  for  a  paper  which  purports  to  be  for  the  whole,  and  not  just  part  of,  the  Jewish  com  munity.   The  fact  that  many  Jewish  commu  nal  organisations  chose  to  march  on  May  28  is  just  as  legitimate  an  item  of  news  for  the  Jewish  communal  news  paper  as  is  any  Jewish  sportsperson,  musician,  labor  activist  and  so  on.   The  editorial  on  “The  power  of  truth  and  reconciliation”  (AJN  26/5/00),  was  one  of  the  finest  expla  nations  of  why  an  apology  is  needed  and  made  me  very  proud  of  “our""  Jewish  News.

"  Jewish  perspectives  on  genome  findings   VIEWPOINT   AGNES  BANK1ER   THE  announcement  of  the  completion  of  a  draft  of  the  human  genome  has  sparked  publicity  and  excitement,  flagged  by  US  President  Bill  Clinton  and  British  Prime  minister  Tony  Blair  as  “the  dawn  of  a  new  era;  the  elimination  of  all  human  disease”.   There  were  newspaper  headlines  such  as  “A  gift  to  humanity”  and  “Beginning  to  read  the  Book  of  Life”.  Not  surprisingly,  for  many  this  brings  significant  confusion.  What  does  it  all  mean?  What  is  the  Jewish  perspective  and  is  there  a  Jewish  perspective  at  all?   The  genetic  code  has  been  chopped  up  and  the  “letters”  in  the  “paragraphs”  are  now  known  as  a  draft,  yet  to  be  confirmed  and  ordered  and  their  meaning  interpreted.  There  is  no  universal  agreement  on  the  specific  interpretation  of  what  it  is  that  has  been  discovered.   At  a  recent  meeting  of  the  European  Society  of  Human  Genetics,  the  plenary  session  on  the  Human  Genome  Project  reported  that  in  fact  about  70  percent  of  the  genome  had  been  sequenced  and  only  20  percent  of  this  had  been  ordered.  It  was  suspected  that  the  privately  owned  Celera  Genomics  had  sequenced  more,  but  details  were  lacking.  Of  the  23  pairs  of  chro  mosomes,  only  the  smallest  chromosomes  (numbers  21  and  22)  have  been  fully  sequenced.  Of  a  possible  80,000  genes,  we  know  about  some  6000  and  can  test  whether  or  not  they  carry  the  normal  or  altered  (disease-caus  ing)  sequence.  We  know  very  little  about  the  control  of  specific  genes  and  how  they  interact  with  each  other.  Even  if  the  reading  of  the  code  is  not  yet  a  reality,  genetic  research  in  the  past  decade  has  opened  new  possibilities  which  are  both  exciting  and  a  cause  for  caution.   It  is  a  major  breakthrough  that  gene  testing  not  only  confirms  the  diagnosis  in  a  person  with  symptoms  and  signs,  but  can  also  provide  pre   dictive  tests.  These  tests  may  predict  whether  a  currently  healthy  family  member  will  develop  the  condition  in  the  future,  whether  they  are  at  risk  of  having  affected  children  or  provide  tests  during  pregnancy  to  check  if  the  foetus  is  affect   ed.   In  an  IVF  setting,  pre-implantation  genetic  diagnosis  can  allow  the  unaffected  embryo  to  be  selected  pre-pregnancy!

A  small  sample  can  provide  genetic  identification  in   forensic  work.   The  identification  of  genes  providing  genetic  susceptibility  in  complex  disorders  will  soon   make  it  possible  to  produce  more  targeted  treatment  options  through  pharmaco-genetics.   Whilst  gene  therapy  (replacing  faulty  genes)  is  the  subject  of  much  research,  it  has  only  been  achieved  rarely,  and  so  far  in  a  limited  way.  Stem  cell  research  and  therapeutic  cloning  may  offer  other  treatment  options.  Those  who  believe  in  genetic  determinism  predict  that  much  of  our  personality  and  behaviour  may  be  explained  in   the  near  future  by  identifying  specific  genes.   There  are  almost  as  many  Jewish  perspec  tives  as  there  are  Jews  in  our  community.  If  one  takes  the  perspective  of  traditional  Judaism,  one  would  assume  that  the  time  has  come  for   inis  Knowieuge  Ul  UIC  iiuutcui  genuine  LKJ  uc   revealed  to  us,  and  it  is  in  our  hands  to  use  this  knowledge  for  “good”  or  “evil”.  Each  individual  has  free  will  and  is  accountable.  To  the  Creationist  or  the  Orthodox  Jew,  the  elegant  simplicity  of  a  four-nucleotide  alphabet  of  the  genetic  code  and  its  intricate  and  complex  con  trol  mechanisms  is  a  proof  of  a  Divine  Plan,  the  work  of  the  Creator.   The  fact  that  many  proteins  and  genetic  codes  between  species  are  highly  conserved  (have  similar  codes)  is  the  proof  of  evolution  to  some  and  a  proof  of  a  Divine  design  to  others.  And  the  fact  that  on  the  markers  tested  there  is  reportedly  no  difference  between  races  will  prove  to  some  that  we  have  evolved  from  prim  itive  man  and  to  others  that  we  originate  from  the  one  Adam.  Each  of  us  differs  from  the  other  by  several  billion  base  pairs,  so  each  can  be  seen  as  a  unique  creation.   Craig  Venter  from  Celera  Genomics  observed  that  in  his  experience  the  human  spirit  is  impor  tant  and  stated  that  “we  are  clearly  much,  much  more  than  the  sum  totals  of  our  genes”.  Those  who  believe  that  each  man  has  a  soul  do  not  believe  that  a  genetic  code  will  ever  fully  define  a  human  being.  No  two  clones  (if  man  were  to  produce  them)  can  ever  be  the  same  because  each  would  have  a  unique  soul  and  his  person  al  existential  relationship  with  the  Creator.   As  Jews,  we  have  been  politically  active  champions  of  human  rights.  The  Human  Genome  Project  will  provide  new  opportunities  to  ensure  that  the  new  knowledge  is  made  avail  able  fairly  to  all  people  and  that  those  found  to  carry  a  genetic  burden  are  not  the  subject  of  discrimination  or  social  injustice.  We  have  always  valued  knowledge  and  autonomy,  respecting  individual  choice.  The  new  knowl  edge  generated  through  the  Human  Genome  Project,  like  all  knowledge  for  a  Jew,  is  to  be  acquired,  analysed  and  applied  in  a  responsible  manner.  We  will  need  to  make  deliberate  choic  es  because  we  are  accountable.

"  J  ewish  Brigade:  Our  unsung  heroes   VIEWPOINT   LEN  RflAHEMOFF   ON  August  29,1939  —  five  days  before  England  declared  war  on  Germany  —  Dr  Chaim  Weizmann  wrote  to  the  British  Prime  Minister,  assuring  him  that  the  Jews  of  Palestine  would  “stand  by  Great  Britain  and  fight  on  the  side  of  the  democracies”.   Despite  the  bitter  disappointment  from  the  British  Cabinet’s  White  Paper  of  May  1939,  which  had  as  its  aim  the  cessation  of  Jewish  migration  to  Palestine,  the  Jewish  Agency  in  Jerusalem  again  reassured  the  Prime  Minister  on  September  3,1939:  “The  Jewish  community  has  a  threefold  concern:  the  protection  of  the  Jewish  Homeland,  the  welfare  of  the  Jewish  people,  the  victory  of  the  British  Empire.”   On  the  same  day,  the  Jews  of  Palestine  were  committed  by  a  decision  of  the  Jewish  Agency  and  the  General  Council  of  the  Jews  of  Palestine  (Va’adLeumi)  to  register  as  volunteers  to  serve  the  needs  of  the  Jewish  community  in  terms  of  the  economy  and  security,  as  well  as  putting  themselves  at  the  disposal  of  the  British  mili  tary.   From  this  beginning  —  the  registration  of  86,000  men  and  50,000  women  signifying  readi  ness  to  serve  —  the  seeds  of  the  Jewish  Brigade   were  sown.   Again  in  December  1939,  Dr  Weizmann  pro  posed  the  training  of  Palestinian  Jews  as  junior  officers  in  order  that  a  Jewish  military  unit  could  be  formed.  There  was  no  response.   When  Italy  entered  the  war  in  June  1940,  and  another  plea  by  Dr  Weizmann  went  unheeded,  he  wrote  to  the  new  Prime  Minister,  Winston  Churchill.  He  pointed  emotionally  to  “[the]  grave  responsibility  [that]  would  attach  to  the  British  Government”  for  the  catastrophe  that  could   Soldiers  of  the  Jewish  Brigade  with  Holocaust  survivors  at  a  camp  on  the  Italian-Austrian  border.   befall  Palestinian  Jewry  if  British  forces  were  to  withdraw  without  a  Jewish  army  having  been  formed  and  trained.   His  words  seemed  to  have  some  effect.  A  limit  ed  scheme  was  approved  for  the  formation  of  Jewish  units  to  be  formed  within  the  British  Army  in  Palestine.  But  further  postponements  thwart  ed  implementation  of  the  scheme,  and  in  October  1941  Dr  Weizmann  was  notified  that  the  plan,  while  originally  approved,  was,  because  of  “prac  tical  difficulties  and  lack  of  equipment”,  not  con  sidered  feasible  and  therefore  rejected.  It  was  apparent  that  political  considerations  were  uppermost  in  the  minds  of  the  British  Cabinet.   Although  there  was  a  small  but  gradual  evolu  tion  of  units  in  Palestine  comprising  only  Jews  as  the  war  unfolded,  it  is  necessary  to  understand  this  background  —  with  all  its  frustration,  failure  and  lost  opportunity—in  order  to  appreciate  the  emotions  that  must  have  teen  present  when,  in   autumn  1944,  authority  for  the  formation  of  a  “Jewish  Brigade  group”  was  officially  granted.   The  Jewish  Brigade,  consisting  of  approxi  mately  5000  soldiers  in  infantry,  artillery  and  service  units,  was  placed  under  the  command  of  a  Canadian-born  Jew,  Brigadier  Ernest  Benjamin.   When  the  Jewish  Brigade  took  part  in  some  of  the  final  battles  of  the  war  on  the  Italian  front  in  May  1945  —  notably  the  battle  of  the  Senio  River  Valley  near  Bologna—it  had  its  first  contact  with  Holocaust  survivors.  Although  it  was  decommis  sioned  in  the  summer  of  1946,  it  was  the  skills  and  tenacity  learned  as  disciplined  soldiers  that  enabled  members,  working  with  other  equally  motivated  and  single-minded  groups,  to  secure  the  miracle  of  Jewish  deliverance.   The  common  denominators  of  fighting  for  the  redemption  of  their  country  coupled  with  the   establishment  of  a  Jewish  State  now  had  an  added  dimension  —  the  liberation  and  trans   porting  to  Palestine  of  the  survivors  of  the  death  camps,  together  with  other  remnants  of  European  Jewry  who  had  managed  to  stay  alive.   The  struggle  documented  and  popularised  in  such  stories  as  Exodus  is  well-known,  including  the  British  Labour  Government’s  continued  refusal  to  permit  mass  migration  to  Palestine.  But  there  was  no  stopping  the  dedicated  mission  of  Jewish  refugees  to  reach  Palestine.   Aided  not  only  by  the  Jewish  Brigade,  but  also  by  members  of  the  Palmach  (which  contained  elements  of  the  Brigade)  and  other  heroic  ele  ments,  the  movement  to  bring  the  survivors  of  war-tom  Europe  to  their  national  homeland  ulti  mately  succeeded.   The  main  activities  of  the  Jewish  Brigade  cen  tred  around  rescuing  survivors  in  concentration  camps  in  Austria  and  Germany.  When  the  enor  mity  of  the  task  became  apparent,  camps  were  set  up  in  Italy,  where  the  rescued  were  housed  before  undertaking  the  journey  to  Palestine.  This  lifesaving  work  is  not  only  a  story  of  heroism  and  daring,  but  one  which  demonstrated  the  ingenu  ity  of  undercover  plans  which  sought  to  achieve  the  goal  of  rescuing  as  many  people  as  possible  in  the  shortest  possible  time.   One  marvels  at  the  logistics—supplying  food,  clothing,  documentation  and  other  necessities  to  thousands  of  people,  broken  in  spirit  and  health  and  who  had  lost  all  their  possessions.   Of  the  range  of  factors  leading  to  the  adoption  by  the  United  Nations  of  the  resolution  which  established  the  State  of  Israel,  the  decisive  one  was  the  demand  by  survivors  for  a  refuge.   To  pay  tribute  to  this  period  of  Jewish  history,  particularly  to  the  Jewish  Brigade,  a  major  func  tion  is  being  organised  in  Sydney.  In  preparing  this  “Evening  of  Tribute”,  an  invitation  is  extend  ed  to  members  of  the  community  to  attend  an  information  afternoon  at  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  on  August  13  at  3pm,  where  a  docu  mentary  will  be  screened  and  an  invitation  issued  for  participation  in  the  project.  Interest  may  be  expressed  by  contacting  (02)  8569  7130  or  email  jewish.brigades@mbox.com.au   ■  Len  Mahemoff  is  a  project  officer  with  B’nai  B’rith  Singers. ",2000-07-28
"  THE  Jewish  vote  is  always  an  intriguing  sideshow  in  fin   American  election.  In  the  context  of  the  current  extraordi  nary  presidential  contest,  however,  it  has  acquired  far  more  than  curiosity  value,  proving  to  be  one  of  numerous  crucial  factors  which  will  ultimately  determine  the  identity  of  the  man  who  will  take  up  office  in  the  White  House  on  January  20  next   year.   The  country  that  has  always  prided  itself  as  the  bastion  of  democracy  is  floundering  in  a  mire  of  ballot  recounts  and  legal  challenges  which  seem  more  properly  to  belong  in  a  political  environment  unused  to  the  complexities  of  elections.  Indeed,  a  Zimbabwe  Government  minister  was  unable  to  resist  taking  a  swipe  at  the  United  States  this  week,  offering  to  fly  to  Washington  to  help  oversee  its  electoral  process  —  an  obvious  retort  to  recent  American  criticism  of  Zimbabwe’s  political  system,  which  is  riddled  with  corruption.   While  the  quagmire  in  Florida  is  being  sorted  out,  it  is  interest  ing  to  note  that  it  was  the  choices  —  and  errors  —  of  thousands  of  Jewish  voters  which  have  played  a  key  role  in  the  outcome  of  the  election.  The  Jewish  population  of  the  US  is  not  such  a  sig  nificant  proportion  of  the  whole  that  the  Jewish  vote  should  mat  ter  decisively;  but  several  demographic  and  social  factors  have  combined  to  give  that  vote  a  disproportionate  influence.   One  is  the  concentration  of  Jewish  voters  in  several  key  states,  including  Florida,  where  a  poorly-designed  ballot  paper  misled  many  voters  into  casting  their  votes  for  Pat  Buchanan  instead  of  A1  Gore.  Buchanan  himself  has  admitted  that  he  gained  many  votes  to  which  he  was  probably  not  entitled.  The  irony  of  such  a  vote  is  that  Buchanan  is  known  for  his  antisemitic  and  racist  views,  yet  he  gained  five  times  as  many  votes  from  an  area  with  a  strong  Jewish  presence  than  he  did  from  the  surrounding  regions.   Florida,  particularly  Palm  Beach,  where  the  controversy  cen  tres,  is  a  cliche  of  American  Jewish  life  —  core  material  for  come  dians  such  as  Jackie  Mason,  who  observe  the  extraordinary  anthropology  of  the  heavily  Jewish  retirement  communities.  Jews  tend  to  vote  Democrat,  even  in  places  like  Palm  Beach,  where  they  are  often  affluent  and  on  economic  grounds  alone  might  be  expected  to  swing  right.  Indeed,  it  is  one  of  the  anomalies  of  the  Jewish  vote  that  as  migrants  who  struggled  to  achieve,  many  have  retained  liberal  principles,  continuing  to  vote  as  if  they  are  still  indigent  migrants,  despite  having  attained  material  success.   Also  relevant  is  the  fact  that  in  an  election  which  drew  a  nation  al  turnout  of  little  over  50  percent,  the  majority  of  Jewish  voters  embraced  their  right  to  vote.  This  is  no  social  accident,  the  com  bination  of  a  history  of  disenfranchisement  and  current  high  level  of  education  and  commitment  to  social  values  making  many  of  them  deeply  involved  citizens.   There  is  another  —  major  —  Jewish  factor  in  this  presiden   tial  race:  Senator  Joseph  Lieberman,  Gore’s  running  mate  and  the  first  Jew  in  history  with  a  realistic  chance  of  becoming  Vice-President  of  the  United  States.  Lieberman  is  not  merely  Jewish,  he  is  religiously  observant,  and  he  is  outspoken  about  it.  In  fact,  he  drew  flak  on  a  number  of  occasions  from  Jewish  quarters  during  the  campaign  for  his  open  espousal  of  the  need  for  faith  in  an  electoral  context  in  which  the  mandatory  sep  aration  of  Church  and  State  must  be  balanced  with  an  electorate  which  is  far  more  religious  than  Australia’s,  and  which  likes  to  feel  that  its  candidates  believe  in  something.   From  the  Jewish  point  of  view,  probably  the  most  significant  factor  of  the  election  was  that  for  the  most  part,  Lieberman’s  Jewishness  became  a  non-issue.  After  the  initial  flurry  over  what  Lieberman  would  do  in  a  Shabbat  emergency,  and  the  flush  of  worldwide  reflected  naches  that  there  could  be  a  Second  Lady  named  Hadassah,  most  American  voters,  Jewish  and  non-Jewish,  got  on  with  the  job,  understanding  that  a  candidate’s  faith  and  religious  practice  were  essentially  none  of  their  business.   In  fact,  it  is  when  the  strongly  Jewish  identity  of  a  potential  Vice-President  of  the  United  States  can  become  a  non-issue  that  true  equality  has  been  achieved.  In  that  sense,  whoever  finally  wins  this  extraordinary  election,  Lieberman’s  candidacy  has  already  given  American  Jews,  and  by  extension  Jews  around  the   world,  a  vital  boost.   Meanwhile,  the  fact  that  the  system  might  produce  a  President  (George  Bush)  who  failed  to  win  the  majority  of  American  votes  means  that  it  is  fundamentally  flawed.  Each  state  is  allocated  a  set  number  of  votes  in  what  is  termed  the  electoral  college,  and  the  candidate  who  carries  the  state  wins  all  the  electoral  college  votes  for  that  state  —  which  is  where  the  flaw  lies,  for  he  or  she  might  have  in  fact  won  only  51  percent  of  the  votes  of  that  par  ticular  state.  The  American  electoral  system  demands  to  be  looked  at  —  although  changing  it  would  ultimately  require  an  amendment  to  the  US  Constitution,  which  could  take  years.

"  TU  b’Shvat,  the  New  Year  for  Trees,  would  have  to  rate  as   one  of  the  least  observed  Jewish  festivals,  particularly   here  in  Australia.   Part  of  the  reason  is  the  coincidence  of  the  Jewish  and  Western  calendars.  Just  as  Chanukah  tends  to  be  overplayed  because  of  Christmas  or  because  it  falls  when  schools  are  looking  for  an  end-of-year  concert  theme,  Tu  b’Shvat  tends  to  get  lost  in  the  summer  ellipsis.  Rabbis  shrug,  knowing  that  large  sections  of  their  congregations  are  away,  schools  are  closed  and  it’s  just  not  a  good  time  to  focus  a  community  on  any  function  or  issue.   It  is  an  irony  and  a  shame  that  Tu  b’Shvat,  which  is  observed  this  year  on  Saturday,  January  22,  so  often  falls  between  the  cracks.  In  a  generation  when  so  many  of  us,  particularly  so  many  younger  Jews,  are  looking  for  ways  to  link  our  secular  and  Jewish  commitments  and  to  find  social  and  ethical  impe  tus  in  Jewish  observance,  a  day  dedicated  to  environmental  concerns  should  be  grasped  and  elevated.   Tu  b’Shvat  has  its  origins  in  the  practical  observances  of  an  agricultural  society.  Over  the  past  2000  years,  Jews  have  been  urbanised  so  thoroughly  that  many  of  the  harvest  festivals  —  not  only  Tu  b’Shvat,  but  also  Succot  and  Shavuot,  and  even  Pesach  —  have  lost  a  substantial  segment  of  their  original  meaning.  Of  course,  Judaism  being  as  multi-faceted  as  it  is,  most  festivals  have  other  religious  and  cultural  meanings,  which  have  filled  the  void.  But  the  agricultural  elements  are  often  lost,  most  particularly  in  the  southern  hemisphere  when  it  seems  a  little  bizarre  to  shiver  in  a  succah  during  early  spring,  instead  of  enjoying  a  balmy  autumn.  Anyone  who  has  ever  tried  to  plant  something  for  Tu  b’Shvat  and  seen  it  whith  er  in  an  Australian  summer  knows  that  observance  of  agricul  tural  festivals  can  be  virtually  impossible  in  the  wrong  hemi  sphere.   But  beyond  the  literalism  of  traditional  observance,  agricul  tural  festivals  offer  a  great  opportunity  for  reflection  for  the  modern  Jew  who  is  socially  and  politically  aware.  Over  the  past  couple  of  generations,  there  has  been  a  growing  aware  ness  that  continuous  urbanisation  and  industrialisation  comes  at  an  enormous  cost.  The  20th  century  may  well  be  remem  bered  as  the  turning-point  for  Western  societies  which,  until  recently,  ploughed  on  with  “progress”  —  so  often  a  misnomer  —  oblivious  to  the  damage  left  behind.  The  environmental  movement  has  arisen  to  remind  us  that  we  cannot  ignore  the  natural  world,  that  to  distance  ourselves  from  the  soil  and  the  sea  will  ultimately  destroy  everything  we  have  built.   Jewish  20th-century  experience  has  also  reminded  us  of   the  importance  of  agriculture.  The  cliche  of  Zionism  is  the  desert  blooming.  It  is  the  justifiable  boast  of  the  Jewish  National  Fund  —  and  a  damning  indictment  of  mankind  —  that  Israel  was  the  only  country  in  the  world  to  end  the  20th-cen  tury  with  more  frees  than  it  had  at  the  beginning  of  the  centu  ry.  Israel  is  often  cited  as  a  country  which  offers  international  aid  and  expertise  in  agriculture.  The  Zionist  enterprise  has   Ijpng  been  identified  with  a  return  no^iust  to  the  land  of  Israel,   but  also  to  an  appreciation  of  land,  nature  and  agriculture.   Of  coprse,  Israel  has  been  far  from  perfect  in  this  process?  As1  Australians  know  only  too  well,  in  50  year^the  u$3ustri  alisecl  state  has  also  created  a  pollution  problem.  The  appalling  state  of  the  Yarkon  River  into  which  100  Australian  athletes  fell  at  the  1997  Maccabiah  Games  is  but  one  example  of  a  much  wider  problem.  In  the  bridge  tragedy  fallout,  the  focus  has  been  understandably  on  the  bridge  that  should  never  have  broken;  but  the  river  should  not  be  so  grossly  pol  luted  either,  and  .we  support  wholeheartedly  the  Australians  in  Israel  who  are  now  involved  in  cleaning  the  river.   Here  in  Australia,  many  prominent  Jews  are  involved  in  the  leadership  of  the  environmental  movement,  as  is  so  common  in  the  vanguard  of  many  socially  progressive  movements.  But  there  are  also  businesses  and  individuals  who  have  yet  to  take  stock  of  one  of  the  most  pressing  issues  of  our  time.   We  are  only  at  the  beginning  of  a  movement  which  will  hope  fully  make  environmental  issues  a  matter  of  crucial  and  con  tinuous  consideration  for  consumers,  for  manufacturers,  for  decision-makers;and  for  private  households.  The  imperatives  here  are  both  personal  and  political,  and  it  is  noteworthy  that  these  are  matters  which  seem  to  have  been  grasped  most  thoroughly  by  the  youngest  members  of  our  community.  It  is  they,  after  all,  who  have  the  most  stake  in  the  future.  Our  youth  groups  have  taken  on  such  tasks  as  recycling,  partici  pating  in  clean-up  days  and  considering  carefully  the  environ  mental  safety  of  products  they  buy.  All  communal  organisa  tions  and  individuals  should  be  following  their  lead.  Professionally  and  personally,  in  our  business  lives  and  home  lives,  it  is  incumbent  upon  us  all  to  be  aware  of  the  precious   ness  of  natural  resources.   Environmental  awareness  is  a  Jewish  imperative,  part  of  the  traditional  task  of  tikkun  olam  —  healing  the  world.  We  forget  it  at  our  peril. ",2000-01-21
"  SEtira  Se&amp;lta   SYDNEY  writer  Mark  Braham  has  alleged  that  die  London  Jewish  Chronicle  is  involved  in  a  “sinister  and  malicious  plot”  or  “conspiracy  to  kill  the  sale”  of  his  latest  book  and  to  “destroy”  his  “reputation  as  a  writer”.   He  has  submitted  a  complaint  to  this  effect  to  the  London  Beth  Din  and  is  considering  legal   action.   Jewish  Chronicle  editor  Ned  Temko  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  the  paper  “utterly  rejects  the  suggestions  made  by  Mr  Braham”.   Mr  Braham’s  book,  Stronger  Than  Fiction:  Jews  and  Christians  are  Natural  Allies,  published  by  London’s  Minerva  Press  last  year,  was  reviewed  in  the  Jewish  Chronicle  last  December.   Under  the  headline  “Listing  from  one  preju  dice  to  another”,  the  reviewer,  Liberal  Jewish  Synagogue  Senior  Rabbi  David  Goldberg,  describes  the  book  as  a  “hectoring,  one-dimen  sional,  smug,  in-your-face  collection  of  autobi  ography  and  (using  the  word  loosely)  ‘think  pieces’  from  antipodean  journals”,  which  has  “all  the  literary  merit  of  a  shopping  list...  of  the  author’s  pet  prejudices”.   The  book  has  “all  the  literary  merit  of  a  shopping  list...  of  the  author's  pet  prejudices”  -  Jewish  Chronicle   As  for  Mr  Braham,  the  review  continues,  he  is  a  “no-nonsense  Torah-true  Jew...  whose  50-year  marriage,  four  children  and  16  grandchildren,  all  equally  observant,  appear  uniquely  to  qualify  him  to  hold  forth  on  the  dangers  of  Reform,  sec  ular  Zionism,  homosexuality  and  a  range  of   other  issues”.   Conceding  that  “amid  the  bluster  are  a  couple  of  arguments  that  merit  consideration”,  Rabbi  Goldberg  concludes  that  “no  rational  discourse  is  possible  with  someone  ...  who  cites,  as  con  clusive  proof  that  non-Orthodox  Judaism  equals  extinction,  the  statistic  that  there  are  no  Jewish   Mark  Braham  ...  seeking  a  Din   Torah  (Torah  judgment)  from  the  London  Beth  Din.   Right:  The  cover  of  Mr  Braham's  book.   descendants  today  in  the  Reform  branch  of  his  wife’s  family.   “Surely  Orthodoxy  can  find   subtler  advocates  than  this.  1   await  with  sinking  heart  the  inevitable  letter  from  Mr  Braham  putting  me  right.”   However,  the  Jewish  Chronicle  did  not  publish  the  letter  which  Mr  Braham  wrote  in  response,  or  a  letter  from  a  reader  supporting  his  book.   Rabbi  Goldberg  “implied  that  my  reply  was  bound  to  be  published  because  that’s  journalis  tic  ethics”,  Mr  Braham  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.  “Why  should  the  letters  editor  reject  both  letters,  which  were  the  normal  response  of  an   author  and  reader?”   In  his  letter,  Mr  Braham  accused  Rabbi   Goldberg  of  using  “a  formula  that  would  not  nor  mally  disgrace  the  pages  of  a  respectable  publi  cation:  select  items  from  the  book  which,  when  taken  out  of  context,  appear  far-fetched,  ignore  the  main  theme  and  condemn  the  book  out  right”.   Rabbi  Goldberg  omitted  to  mention  the  important  theme  contained  in  the  book’s  sub  title,  Jews  and  Christians  are  Natural  Allies,  Mr  Braham  wrote,  “and  your  sub-editor  supported  the  ruse  by  leaving  it  out  of  the  title”.   Mr  Braham  initiated  a  protracted  correspon  dence  with  Jewish  Chronicle  literary  editor  Gerald  Jacobs,  maintaining  that  “David  Goldberg  had  no  qualifications  whatsoever  for  reviewing  the  book  with  any  kind  of  objectivity.  He  is  a  senior  minister  of  a  religious  faction,  which  I  have  dismissed  in  the  book  as  pseudo  Judaism.  His  position  confronted  with  the  kind   of  evidence  I  have  produced  to  under   mine  his  corrupted  view  of  Judaism  is  rendered  untenable.  The  evidence  is  in  his  review,  which  makes  no  attempt  to  answer  my  religious  arguments,  but  consists  solely  of  a  somewhat  puerile  attempt  to  condemn  me  as  a  ‘prejudiced  fundamentalist’  with  whom  ‘no  rational  discourse  is  possi  ble’.”   Moreover,  Rabbi  Goldberg  ignored  “99  percent  of  what  else  the  book  is  saying”,  Mr  Braham  charged.  “There  are  dozens  of  highly  qualified  and  competent  Orthodox  rabbis  in  the  UK  who  could  have  been  called  upon  to  review  the  book,  as  well  as  any  num   ber  of  war  historians  ...  Each  of  the  author’s  ‘prejudices’  are  explained  and  highly  qualified,  and  thus  qualified  represent  the  considered  ‘prejudices’  of  Orthodox  rabbis  and  scholars  throughout  the  world.”   Mr  Jacobs  “strenuously  rejected”  Mr  Braham’s  accusations  and  defended  the  choice  of  reviewer.  “Reviewers  are  not  chosen  idly  and  I  am  convinced  that  (a)  David  Goldberg  was  well-qualified  to  review  your  book  and  (b)  his  opinions  are  honestly  expressed,”  he  wrote  to   Mr  Braham.   “We  have  commissioned  an  experienced,  intelligent  and  articulate  reviewer  whose  over  whelmingly  critical  review  has  upset  the  author  —  yourself.  There  is  nothing  unusual  in  this  and  certainly  nothing  sinister  or  biased  ...  Rabbi  Goldberg  has  always  demonstrated  profession  al  integrity...  Reviewers  are  not  constrained  into  commenting  on  any  particular  aspect  or  aspects  of  the  book  and  they  are  certainly  not  expected  to  rehearse  its  contents  in  full.""   The  book’s  sub-title  had  not  been  printed  so  as  to  save  “valuable  space”,  and  “only  a  small  minority  of  the  number  of  letters  we  receive  can  be  published”,  Mr  Jacobs  explained.  “Among  several  astonishing  statements  made  in  your  let  ter”  he  told  Mr  Braham,  “the  suggestion  that  this  newspaper  would  indulge  in  a  ‘conspiracy  to  kill  the  sale’  of  your  book  is  patently  absurd”.   Nevertheless,  Mr  Braham  made  representa  tions  to  the  Press  Complaints  Commission  in  London,  which,  he  said,  “could  not  deal  with  my  complaint  as  it  doesn’t  come  within  their  code  of  practice,  but  forwarded  it  to  the  Jewish   Chronicle"".   Alistair  Hall  of  the  Press  Complaints  Commission  wrote  to  Mr  Braham  that  “there  was  no  breach  of  the  code”  under  which  “news  papers  are  entitled  to  take  a  partisan  view  pro  vided  they  distinguish  between  comment,  con  jecture  and  fact”.   Mr  Braham  has  now  turned  to  the  London  Beth  Din,  seeking  a  Din  Torah  (Torah  judgment)  against  the  newspaper,  Mr  Jacobs  and  Rabbi  Goldberg.  “I’ve  also  submitted  the  case  to  a  solicitor  in  London,  but  will  only  resort  to  legal  action  if  the  parties  refuse  to  attend  the  Beth  Din   for  an  arbitration.”   The  book  had  been  positively  received  in  Australia,  Mr  Braham  said.  But  in  the  UK,  “the  Jewish  Chronicle  has  a  huge  following,  not  only  in  the  Jewish  community,  and  it  influences  the  general  media.  For  many  weeks  after  the  review  appeared,  my  publishers  found  the  market  quite  dead  and  couldn’t  get  any  other  reviews.”   Interest  in  the  UK  has  picked  up  recently,  however,  with  several  religious  publications,  including  two  other  Jewish  newspapers,  indi  cating  that  they  will  review  the  book.

"  Sir  Gustav  proud  of  Jewish  roots   Stefan  Bialoguski   THE  joie  de  vivre  of  Australian  of  the  Year  Sir  Gustav  Nossal  is  enough  to  brighten  the  darkest  day.   True,  being  named  the  quintes  sential  Australian  means  he  has  plenty  to  celebrate,  the  only  cloud  on  the  horizon  being  the  “very  pleasant  chore”  of  replying  to  hun  dreds  of  congratulatory  letters  piled  on  his  desk.   But  lingering  perceptibly  behind  his  conviviality  is  a  family  history  that  embraces  the  two  greatest  tragedies  to  befall  modern  Jewry:  the  Holocaust  and  assimilation.  On  both  counts,  the  story  he  tells  with  the  charming  erudition  of  a  Peter  Ustinov  is  one  that  is  all  too  com  mon  among  post-Enlightenment  European  Jews.   However,  perhaps  it  is  the  genet  ic  memory  passed  through  his  father’s  lineage  that  has  left  Sir  Gustav  sharing  the  Jewish  affilia  tion  for  learning,  righteousness  and  justice.  That  affinity  with  his  Jewish  forebears,  combined  with  a  Roman  Catholic  upbringing,  also  points  to  a  possible  underlying  explanation  for  his  commitment  to  reconcilia  tion.  As  he  said  when  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  presented  him  with  the  award:  “I  regard  this  [award]  as  a  sacred  trust...  to  work  for  reconciliation  with  Aboriginals.”   So  too  does  he  hope  for  reconcil  iation  between  his  Church  and  his  ancestors.   “I  think  reconciliation  is  a  very,  very  good  idea.  The  fact  of  the  mat  ter  is  we  both  [Christians  and  Jews]  have  a  very  long  heritage.  It’s  often  forgotten  that  Jesus  Christ  was  a  Jew.  We  share  half  of  our  sacred  books  with  the  Jews.  There’s  a  great  deal  in  common:  we’re  both  monotheistic  and  in  many  respects  we  share  a  kind  of  value  system.”   Sir  Gustav’s  dual  background  was  unwittingly  highlighted  by  fellow  pupils  at  the  Double  Bay  school  he  attended  on  immigrating  to  Australia  from  Austria  in  1939  with  his  parents;  some  called  him  a  “Jewboy”  while  others  derided  him  for  being  a  German  enemy.   The  68-year-old  scientist,  charity  worker,  social  activist  and  company   director  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  this  week  how  his  paternal  great-grandparents  were  among  the  first  Bohemian  Jews  to  be  allowed  to  settle  in  Linz,  Austria.  “At  around  the  beginning  of  the  20th  century,  my  grandparents,  who  were  not  religious,  got  sick  of  the  opprobri  um  of  being  Jewish  and  wanted  to   join  mainstream  Austrian  society,  which  of  course,  was  Christian.  So  my  father  and  his  brother  were  bap  tised.  But  given  that  the  Catholic  faith  made  certain  demands  on  peo  ple,  such  as  attending  Mass  on  Sundays  and  not  eating  meat  on  Fridays,  my  grandparents,  some  what  cynically  perhaps,  had  them  baptised  Lutheran.”   Sir  Gustav’s  father  was  a  wealthy  banker  who  was  able  to  send  the  boys  to  the  top  Catholic  school  in  Vienna.  Both  eventually  married  Catholic  girls.   “You  can’t  resign  from  the  Jewish  persuasion,  and  there’s  no  doubt  that  in  the  eyes  of  most  Austrians,  this  meant  we  were  still  Jewish,  and  this  led  to  a  reasonably  conflicted  situation  in  my  father’s  develop  ment.”   Austria’s  union  with  Germany  in  1938  brought  with  it  the  extension  of  the  Nuremburg  racial  laws,  and  Sir  Gustav’s  father,  seeing  the  dan  ger,  took  his  family  to  Australia  in  1939.  Unfortunately,  his  grandmoth  er  stayed  in  Austria,  only  to  die  at  Theresienstadt  in  1942.  “I  was   “I  was  an  Assistant  Professor  at  Stanford  University.  There,  virtually  all   of  the  famous  professors  and  Nobel  laureates  were  Jewish.  It  was   then  that  I  gloried  in  that  half  of  my  heritage.”   brought  up  knowing  all  these  things.  There  was  never  any  hint  of  a  secret  of  being  half-Jewish.”   But  it  was  not  until  the  age  of  28  that  Sir  Gustav  said  he  fully  relished  his  Jewish  roots.  “I  went  to  California  to  be  an  Assistant  Professor  at  Stanford  University.  There,  virtually  all  of  the  famous  professors  and  Nobel  laureates  were  Jewish.  It  was  then  that  I  glo  ried  in  that  half  of  my  heritage.”   Raised  a  Catholic  and  having  married  a  Catholic,  Sir  Gustav  still  has  particularly  close  ties  to  Jewish  friends  —  including  Israel’s  fifth  President,  Ephraim  Katzir  —  and  to  Israel  itself,  which  he  has  visited  eight  times  and  with  whose  univer  sities  and  hospitals  he  declares  a  close  affinity.   He  represents  much  of  the  Australian  immigrant  experience,  escaping  confusion,  hate  and  war  in  the  old  country  and  striving  to  build  a  better  future  for  himself,  his  community  and  his  adopted  coun  try.  But  one  could  have  literally  knocked  him  down  with  a  feather,  he  said,  when  he  was  telephoned  in   December  with  the  news  that  he  had  been  chosen  as  Australian  of  the  Year.   “I’m  also  very  pleased  because  I  feel  very  Australian.  That’s  what  our  parents  taught  us  to  feel  —  to  believe  in  Australia.  I  definitely  feel  very  Australian.  That  means  a  cer  tain  identification  with  a  country  that  until  60  years  ago  was  almost  entirely  Anglo-Celtic  and  is  now  probably  the  most  multicultural  country  in  the  world  —  in  most  respects  a  very  tolerant  and  fair  community;  being  able  to  live  in  freedom  with  a  stable  democracy  and  a  moderately  high  standard  of  living;  the  Australian  traits  of  good  fellowship  and  fairness.  It  means  a  lot  being  Australian.”   He  has  not  been  told  exactly  why  he  was  chosen,  but  suspects  that  it  was  chiefly  in  recognition  of  his  work  in  medical  science,  particular  ly  his  chairmanship  of  the  $1  billion  Bill  and  Melinda  Gates  Children’s  Vaccine  Program,  which  helps  to  protect  Third  World  youth  from  dis  ease.  Among  his  numerous  other  positions,  he  is  deputy  chairman  of   the  Council  for  Aboriginal   Reconciliation.   Far  from  being  the  pinnacle  of  Sir  Gustav’s  work,  being  named  Australian  of  the  Year  provides  him  with  a  platform  from  which  he  intends  to  push  three  causes  which  are  particularly  close  to  his  heart:  continuing  to  promote  excellence  in  Australian  science  and  technolo  gy,  which  will  involve  restoring  the  “quite  severe  funding  cuts”  endured  by  universities  over  the  past  four  years;  promoting  the  cause  of  Aboriginal  reconciliation,  by  which  he  means  improving  Aboriginal  health,  education  and  housing,  as  well  as  further  “symbol  ic  aspects”;  and  highlighting  the  question  of  the  richer  nations  help  ing  the  poorer,  particularly  in   health  matters.   The  enthusiasm  in  his  voice  left  no  room  for  doubt  that  he  would  be  steaming  full-speed  ahead  in  the  tasks  he  has  set  himself.  “I’m  a  little  tired  contemplating  this  huge  pile  of  congratulatory  letters,  but  I  still  feel  at  68  that  I  have  lots  of  energy   left.”   Australian  of  the  Year  Sir  Gustav  Nossal.

"  out  against   ntro   JERUSALEM:  The  Arab  media  have  greeted  the  nomination  of  Joseph  Lieberman  as  vice-presidential  candi  date  with  everything  from  indiffer   ence  to  vicious  antisemitism.   Some  argue  that  he  is  the  manifes  tation  of  a  sinister  Zionist  plot  to  take   over  the  world.   Hani  Habib  from  the  Palestinian  daily  Al-Ayyam,  summed  up  A1  Gore  and  his  running  mate  thus:  “Both  are  Israelis,  [the  only  difference  is  that]   one  of  them  is  also  a  Jew.”   Jalal  Duweidar,  editor  of  the  Egyptian  Government  paper  Al  Akhbar,  wrote:  “The  US  is  passing  from  indirect  Judaisation  to  direct  and  open  Judaisation”.  In  an  op-ed  titled  “The  Judaisation  of  America,”  Duweidar  sees  Lieberman’s  selection  as  a  further  step  in  the  Jewish  lobby’s  takeover  of  high-ranking  positions  in  the  US  Government.  “A1  Gore  revealed  his  ugly  face,  closing  the  circle  of  sub  mission  begun  by  Clinton  when  he  gave  all  the  strategic  positions  in  his   administration  to  American  Jews  ...  Gore  has  completely  sold  himself  to  Israel  and  the  Jewish  lobby.”   Abbas  Al-Tarabili,  editor  of  the  Egyptian  opposition  paper  Al-Wafd,  wrote  an  op-ed  titled  “The  Zionist  Scenario  to  Take  Control  of  the  World:  A  Jew  in  the  White  House”.  He  wrote:  “The  goal  of  international  Zionism  is  to  rule  the  world.  By  having  one  of  them  enter  the  White  House  and  rule  America,  he  will  become  the  master  of  the  world.  Therefore,  if  Gore  and  Lieberman  succeed,  the  road  will  be  paved  for  the  realisation  of  the  Zionist  dream:  instead  of  having  America  ruled  by  a  man  who  supports  Israel,  have  the  President  of  the  US  be  a  Zionist  Jew  whose  loyalty  is  not  to  the  American  people,  but  to  the  Zionist  way  and  to  the  Jewish  people.”   Al-Tarabili  predicts:  “After  a  period,  through  the  Angel  of  Death  or  other  wise,  Gore  will  die  or  be  removed  and  America  will  find  itself  with  his  Zionist  deputy  as  master  of  the  White  House  and  President  of  America,  the  greatest  country  in  the  world.   “However,  even  if  affairs  remain  in  their  natural  state  and  no  bullet  is  sent  to  end  A1  Gore’s  life  ...  Lieberman  has  opened  the  way  for  himself  and  other  Jews  to  enter  the  White  House  ...  as  masters  of  America  and  the  world.  We  do  not  intervene  in  American  politics,  nor  are  we  able  to  do  so  ...  however,  we  can  warn  of  what  will  happen  if  a  Jew  in  his  religion  and  a  Zionist  in  his  convictions  reaches  the  centre  of  gov  ernment  in  the  White  House  under  the   Senator  Joseph  Lieberman   banner  of  Vice-President  and  then  under  the  banner  of  President.   [Imagine]  if  Israel  rose  up  and  flour  ished  while  America  is  ruled  by  Presidents  who  support  it,  what  will  be  the  situation  when  the  master  of  the  White  House  himself  is  a  pure  Zionist  Jew?  In  that  case,  Israel  will  be  able  to  realise  its  dream  and  the  dream  of  international  Zionism:  a  state  of  Greater  Israel  from  the  Nile  to  the  Euphrates.”   Lieberman  was  described  as  “the  only  person  who  can  collect  from  the   Jews  the  donations  needed  for  Gore’s  campaign  and  operate  the  media,  which  is  controlled  by  the  Jews,  in  Gore’s  favour”.   A  columnist  in  Al-Hayat  said  all  US  Presidents  “are  allies  of  the  Jews”.  Therefore,  the  nomination  of  a  Jew  will  not  cause  any  major  change  in  US  policy  “because  in  all  that  regards  Israel,  they  are  all  Liebermans,  even  though  they  are  not  Jews”.   The  same  position  was  expressed  in  an  editorial  in  the  Egyptian  Government  daily  Al-Akhbar.  “All  [for  mer]  US  presidents  loved  the  Jews   more  than  the  Jews  [loved]  them  selves.  What  would  be  new  about  the  nomination  of  a  Jew  to  Vice  President?  ...  A1  Gore  loves  the  Jews  more  than  the  Jews  love  themselves.”   Jihad  Al-Khazen,  former  Al-Hayat  editor,  reviewed  Lieberman’s  posi  tions:  he  supported  the  relocation  of  the  US  Embassy  to  Jerusalem;  he  called  on  the  Arabs  to  end  their  eco   nomic  boycott  of  Israel;  he  demanded  that  the  Arabs  establish  relations  with  Israel  in  spite  of  [Israel’s]  occupation  of  [Arab]  lands  and  was  among  the  Senate  members  who  threatened  to  end  US  support  of  the  Palestinians  if  Arafat  declares  an  independent   Palestinian  state.   In  light  of  this,  his  “history  provides  enough  evidence  of  his  enmity   towards  the  Arabs  to  attack  him  on  it  and  there  is  no  need  to  attack  him  for  his  religion”.   E!

"  80  JEWISH  NEWSPAPERS  DECEIVED  BY  JESUS  AD   NEW  YORK:  An  advertisement  that  appeared  in  80  American  Jewish  newspapers  looks  fairly   innocuous.   The  title  of  a  film,  The  Rabbi,  appears  in  Hebrew-style  lettering,  above  a  bearded,  kipa-  wearing  man  praying  at  the  Western  Wall.  “The  unforgettable  story  of  an  Israeli  rabbi  and  his  struggles  in  modern  society”  the  caption  says.  “The  drama  of  this  family  relationship  will  move  and  inspire  you.”   What  it  doesn’t  mention  is  that  The  Rabbi—a  one-hour  television  film  screened  throughout  the  US  last  weekend,  is  about  a  “messianic  Jew”  who  convinces  his  Orthodox  family  that  he  did  not  abandon  Judaism  when  he  took  Yeshua  into  his  heart  —  the  name  that  “messianic  Jews”  use  for  Jesus.  Also  omitted  from  the  advertisement  is  that  The  Rabbi  was  produced  by  Morris  Cerullo,  a  San  Diego-based  Christian  missionary  who   describes  himself  as  a  “servant  of  God”.   With  this  misleading  advertisement  and  a  Jewish-owned  firm  as  his  unwitting  accomplice,  Cerullo  managed  to  infiltrate  a  world  generally  beyond  the  grips  of  “messianic  Jews”  and  mis-  sionaries:  the  Jewish  press.  His  strategy  of  going  through  the  Jewish  media  indicates  a  departure  from  missionaries’  traditional  focus  on  Jews  on  the  fringes  to  a  desire  to  reach  a  highly  affiliated   target.   The  movie  conveys  the  idea—rejected  by  all  streams  of  Judaism  —  that  one  can  remain  a  committed  Jew  while  believing  in  Jesus.  It  shows  the  kipa-wearing  “messianic  Jewish”  son,  Yochanan,  enjoying  a  Passover  seder  with  his  family,  with  his  son,  Ya’akov,  singing  the  Four  Questions  and  talking  about  synagogue.  Yochanan  cites  texts  from  the  Hebrew  Bible  that   he  claims  prove  Jesus  is  the  messiah,  and  his  reasoning  wins  over  his  atheist  Holocaust  sur-  vivor  uncle,  his  sister  and  even  his  rabbi-father.  “I  couldn't  blindly  accept  the  rabbis’  interpreta-  tion,”  says  Yochanan,  later  adding;  “the  moment  Yeshua  came  into  my  heart,  I  stopped  hating”.   At  the  end  of  the  film,  Cerullo  appears  on  the  Mount  of  Olives  in  Jerusalem,  explaining  that  “the  purpose  of  this  drama  is  to  demonstrate  why  we  need  to  trust  Yeshua  as  the  messiah.  We’re  not  betraying  our  Jewishness,  but  we’re  becoming  a  better  Jew.”  He  signs  off  with  a  ""Shalom”,  and  the  program  is  followed  by  a  spe-  cial  offer,  in  a  Yiddish-accented  voiceover,  for  a  free  blessing  plaque.   Alerted  to  the  content  of  the  film,  the  Joseph  Jacobs  firm—which  links  prospective  advertis-  ers  to  Jewish  publications  —  said  it  was  con-  tacting  all  the  newspapers  to  let  them  know  about  it,  but  that  by  the  time  it  learned  the  truth  about  The  Rabbi,  most  of  the  newspapers  had  already  been  printed.   The  advertisement  came  through  an  agency,  Walter  Bennett  Communications,  which  said  the  client  wished  to  remain  anonymous  —  “not  entirely  unusual”  in  the  industry.   “It’s  a  Trojan  horse,”  said  Richard  Friedman,  executive  vice-president  of  the  Syracuse  Jewish  Federation  in  New  York—the  first  community  to  notify  Joseph  Jacobs  about  the  movie.  “You  come  into  our  community  and  advertise  this,  but  what  you’re  really  looking  to  do  is  destroy  our  community.  If  you  truly  believe  in  your  mes-  sage  of  Christianity,  then  why  aren’t  you  open  and  above  board?  This  was  stealthy  and  well  thought-out,  and  knowledge  of  the  Jewish  world   went  into  it.   JTA ",2000-04-14
"  Restoring  the  Jewish   presence  in  Auschwitz   Stefan  Bialoguski   OVER  half-a-century,  thousands  of  Jews  have  visited  the  site  of  the  Auschwitz  death  camp,  but  with  no  dedicated  place  in  which  to  say  a  prayer  for  the  1.5  million  Jews  who  were  killed  there.   That  deficiency  has  now  been  remedied  by  the  restoration  of  the  last  remaining  synagogue  in  the   Polish  town  pLQawiecim.  —_^one  of  -  the  other  names  for  Auschwitz.   Adjoining  the  synagogue  is  a  centre  which  provides  information  on  the  centuries-old  Jewish  pres  ence  there  —  a  look  at  the  life  that  was  lost,  rather  than  at  the  way   death  was  instituted.   One  of  the  driving  forces  behind  the  eight-year  struggle  to  recreate  a  living  Jewish  presence  in  the   town  whose  name  has  become  synonymous  with  the  Holocaust  has  been  retired  Sydney  real  estate  developer  Dr  Evelyn  Royal.   Dr  Royal,  who  divides  her  time  between  Point  Piper  and  New  York,  was  quick  to  support  American   businessman  Fred  Schwartz’s  multi-million-dollar  project  that  has  resulted  in  the  Jewish  Centre,  with  its  library,  archives,  confer  ence  rooms  and  kosher  cafe,  as  well  as  the  restoration  of  the  Chevra  Lomdei  Mishnayot  Synagogue  —  partly  because  her  late  husband,  Noah,  was  a  survivor  of  Auschwitz.   “I  feel  fantastic  that  the  centre  has  opened,”  she  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  by  tele  phone  from  New  York.  “We  had  400  people  at  the  opening,  including   Prince  Hassan  of  Jordan.”   The  synagogue  looks  like  it  did  in  the  1930s,  when  it  helped  to   meet  the  needs  of  Oswiecim’s  7000   Jews.  The  Germans  blew  up  the  town’s  other  synagogues  and  used   this  last  one  as  an  ammunition   dump.  Under  Communist  rule,  the  building  was  used  as  a  carpet   warehouse.   Shoah  Foundation  founder  and  Schindler’s  List  film  producer  Steven  Spielberg  has  contributed  filmed  testimony  by  local  sur   vivors  to  be  shown  at  the  Centre,  and  there  are  hopes  for  a  scholar  in-residence  there.  But  it  all  takes  money,  and  Dr  Royal,  as  a  board  member  of  the  Auschwitz  Jewish  Centre  Foundation,  continues  to  play  her  part  in  the  fundraising  to  ensure  the  Centre’s  viability  and  growth.  Approximately  400  people  were  expected  to  attend  a  fundraising  dinner  at  the  United   Nations  last  week.   Dr  Royal,  who  has  been  involved  with  various  Jewish  organisations  and  charities  over  the  years,  said:  “This  is  the  one  project  which  will  last  after  I’ve  gone.  This  is  some  thing  that  will  be  a  legacy,  not  for  us  personally  at  the  Foundation,  but  we  will  have  done  something  beyond  ourselves.  If  it  had  not  been  for  us,  there  would  not  have  been  anything  in  that  town  to  remember  the  Jews  in  the  camp.”   B  Auschwitz  and  Oswiecim:  A  split  personality,  page  15   Dr  Evelyn  Royal ",2000-12-15

"  Ruth  Gruber   VATICAN  CITY:  Pope  John  Paul  II  has  formally  set  his  19th-century  prede  cessor  Pope  Pius  IX  on  the  road  to  sainthood  by  pronouncing  him  “blessed”  at  a  beatification  ceremony.   Beatification,  in  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  is  the  final  step  before  saint   hood.   The  honour  has  raised  a  storm  of  protest  among  Jews,  who  have  warned  that  the  move  could  have  serious  repercussions  on  Jewish   Catholic  relations.   Pius  IX,  who  reigned  from  1846  to  1878,  was  the  last  Pope  to  confine  Jews  to  the  ghetto  and  became  infa  mous  for  ordering  the  1858  kidnap  ping  of  a  seven-year-old  Jewish  boy,  Edgardo  Mortara,  who  had  reportedly  been  secretly  baptised  as  a  baby.   Edgardo  was  seized  from  his  home  in  Bologna  on  the  Pope’s  orders  after  a  servant  told  a  priest  that  she  had  secretly  baptised  the  boy  when  he  was  a  baby.  He  was  taken  to  Rome,  where  he  was  virtually  adopted  by  Pius  IX  and  brought  up  as  a  Catholic.   The  incident  sparked  international  protests.  Emperors  Franz  Joseph  of  Austria  and  Napoleon  III  of  France  urged  the  Pope  to  give  up  the  child,   but  he  remained  adamant.  Mortara  became  a  priest  and  died  in  1940.   The  Pope’s  policy  towards  Jews  was  described  by  an  Italian  historian  as  “trickery,  arrogance  and  cruelty”.  British  Jewish  historian  Cecil  Roth  compared  conditions  for  Jews  under  his  reign  to  those  of  Jews  under  pre   Pope  Pius  IX  ...  ordered  a  seven-year-old  Jewish  boy  kidnapped.   Photo:  Colliers  Encyclopedia   war  Nazi  Germany  in  the  1930s.   For  Jews,  the  beatification  of  Pius  IX  doesn’t  square  with  recent  Church  apologies  for  antisemitism,  which  cul  minated  with  John  Paul’s  prayers  in  Jerusalem  in  March.  The  latest  apolo   gy  came  last  week,  when  Church  lead  ers  in  Pope  John  Paul’s  native  Poland  asked  forgiveness  for  the  Church’s  tol  eration  of  antisemitism  and  disdain  of  non-Catholics  (see  page  3).   The  contradiction  is  particularly   striking  because  Pius  DC  is  not  being  beatified  on  his  own.  In  the  same  cere   mony,  John  Paul  will  beatify  another,  quite  different,  former  Pope  —  Pope  John  XXHI,  the  revered,  universally  beloved  Pontiff  who  died  in  1963  and  whose  five-year  reign  marked  a  turn  ing-point  in  Church  history  and  in   Jewish-Catholic  relations.   Pope  John  XXIII  helped  Jews  during  the  Holocaust  and  convened  the  Second  Vatican  Council  in  1962.  The  Council’s  decisions  revolutionised  the  Church  and  opened  it  to  the  modem  world.  Among  its  pronouncements  was  the  Nostra  Aetate  declaration  in  1965,  which  formally  absolved  Jews  from  having  killed  Jesus  and  opened  the  way  for  Jewish-Catholic  dialogue.   “If  saintliness  is  seen  as  the  good  ness,  wisdom  and  courage  to  behave  righteously  and  right  wrongs,  regard  less  of  when  they  occur,  then  Pius  DC’s  conduct  falls  far  short  of  saintliness,”  Seymour  Reich,  chairman  of  the  International  Jewish  Committee  for  Inter-religious  Consultations,  wrote  in  a  letter  to  the  Vatican.  “His  papal  role  stands  in  sharp  contrast  to  that  of  the  saintly  Pope  John  XXIII  and  John  Paul  II,  who  recognised  the  wrongs  of  the  past  and  sought  to  rectify  them,”  he  wrote  to  Archbishop  Jose  Saraiva  Martins,  chairman  of  the  Congregation  for  the  Causes  of  Saints.   Reich  called  Pius  DC  “the  Pope  who  perpetuated  centuries-old  Church  contempt  and  hatred  for  Jews”  and  branded  the  kidnap  of  Edgardo  an  “assault  on  Judaism  and  parenthood”.  He  reiterated  that  “only  the  Church   itselt  nad  tne  ngnt  10  determine  who  are  its  saints,  but  “when  the  issue  of  sainthood  embodies  matters  of  major  Jewish  concern,  we  believe  the  Jewish  community  has  an  obligation  to  voice  its  reaction”.   The  conflicting  message  inherent  in  twinning  the  beatifications  of  two  such  utterly  different  popes  has  raised  questions  among  liberal  Catholics  and  other  observers,  as  well  as  among  Jews.  James  Walston,  Professor  of  Political  Science  at  the  American  University  in  Rome,  called  the  pairing  “appallingly  dishonest”.   Even  the  Catholic  weekly  The  Tablet  was  critical:  “Two  Popes  of  a  more  dif  ferent  temper  would  be  hard  to  find.”  It  called  the  decision  to  beatify  Pius  IX  “a  beatification  too  far”.  British  church  historian  Owen  Chadwick  was  quoted  as  stating  that  Pius’  record  “verges  on  the  criminal”.   In  addition  to  his  policy  towards  Jews,  it  is  Pius  IX’s  role  as  a  bastion  of  reaction  that  also  alarms  observers.  Deeply  conservative,  he  condemned  anyone  who  believed  the  Pope  “can  and  should  reconcile  himself  with   progress,  liberalism  and  modem  civil  isation”.  He  also  fervently  champi  oned  the  doctrine  of  papal  infallibility.   Said  Walston:  “With  the  joint  beatifi  cation,  John  Paul  and  conservatives  want  to  put  these  Popes,  John  XXIII  and  Pius  IX,  on  the  same  plane”.  The  decision  reaffirms  papal  infallibility,  he  said.  “The  message  is  that  Popes  are  always  right,  regardless  of  whether  one  says  something  is  white  and  the   other  says  it  is  black.”   JTA   njtmmmsiMmsm ",2000-09-08
"  The  Jewish  spirit  of  Rhodes   VIEWPOINT   LYNNE  SOLOMON   IT  was  April  14  this  year  and  I  was  waiting  patiently  for  the  plane  to  take  off  from  Athens  airport  for  the  Island  of  Rhodes.  Although  I  had  no  expectations,  I  was  excited  in  anticipa  tion  of  what  I  was  going  to  discover.   Many  years  ago,  when  touring  Israel,  I  met  someone  whose  family  was  from  Rhodes.

Although  the  Jewish  community  of  Rhodes  dates  back  to  ancient  times,  and  despite  the  fact  that  at  its  height  in  the  1920s,  it  numbered  approximately  4000,  today  it  comprises  only   37  souls.   The  Jewish  community  of  Rhodes  was  made  up  principally  of  Jews  who  were  forced  to  leave  Spain  at  the  time  of  the  Spanish  Inquisition  of  1492.  Large  numbers  of  Sephardim  travelled  across  the  Mediterranean  Sea  to  this  island,  as  well  as  to  such  cities  as  Salonica,  Istanbul  and  Izmir.  These  Spanish  Jewish  refugees  spoke  Ladino,  which  compris  es  both  Spanish  and  Hebrew  words.   At  the  beginning  of  World  War  II,  there  were  six  synagogues  within  the  walled  city  of  Rhodes  in  an  area  called  La  Juderia  (The  Jewish  Quarter).  Guidebook  in  hand,  I  endeav  oured  to  find  the  only  remaining  synagogue  of  the  six.  The  first  night  of  Pesach  was  the  fol  lowing  day,  so  I  was  eager  to  find  out  if  there   was  a  seder  that  I  could  attend.   The  city  is  a  complex  maze  of  narrow  streets.  It  took  a  while  to  find  the  synagogue,  but  when  I  did,  I  was  overwhelmed.  The  interi  or  design  of  the  of  Kahal  Shalom  Synagogue  (Congregation  of  Peace)  follows  the  tradition  al  Sephardi  style,  where  the  bima  is  in  the  cen  tre  of  the  sanctuary,  facing  south-east  towards  Jerusalem.  Oil  lamps  salvaged  from  the  other  synagogues  hang  on  the  arched  ceiling,  while   Kahal  Shalom  ...  the  only  surviving  synagogue  on  Rhodes  Island.   the  design  of  the  black-and-white  pebbled  mosaic  floor  typifies  the  age  of  this  magnifi  cent  building.   Kahal  Shalom  was  built  in  the  16th  century  and  now  houses  all  that  remains  of  the  vibrant   Sephardi  community  that  once  thrived  on  this   I  now  have  some  idea  of  the  magic  that  keeps  the  spirit  alive  on  Rhodes.  I  also   understand  how  that  spirit  holds  all  who  have  had  some  connection  with  it   island.  There  is  a  plaque  at  the  entrance  listing  the  names  of  the  families  who  once  lived  on  the  island  who  were  murdered  by  the  Nazis.   I  was  greeted  by  Lucia  Mondiano  Sulam,  a  delightful  Jewish  woman  who  has  taken  on  the  responsibility  of  being  the  shamash  (caretak  er).  Her  family  has  lived  on  the  island  for  gen  erations.  One  of  the  first  things  she  showed   me  was  the  number  which  was  tattooed  on  her  arm  at  Auschwitz.  Her  words  were  very  moving.  Despite  all  that  she  had  been  through,   a  feeling  of  warmth  and  generosity  encom  passed  her  as  she  told  her  story.   An  American  couple  from  Seattle,  Sally  and  Howard,  spontaneously  approached  and  informed  me  that  a  seder  had  been  organised  at   an  Israeli  restaurant  on  the  outskirts  of  the  town.   As  I  walked  into  the  restaurant,  I  was  greet  ed  by  the  friendly  owner  with  a  ChagSameach.  It  didn’t  take  me  long  to  find  Sally  and  Howard  —  and  I  discovered  to  my  amazement  that  they  knew  my  husband’s  American  family  well.  It  reminded  me  how  we  are  all  part  of  a  global  Jewish  community.   As  we  began  the  reading  of  the  Haggada,  I  felt  at  home  almost  immediately,  not  because  it  was  written  in  Hebrew,  but  due  to  the  pace  that  the  Israelis  were  reading  it.  I  guess  all   around  the  world  everyone  is  in  a  hurry  to  get  to  the  food!  The  food  was  worth  waiting  for,  and  included  dishes  that  are  typical  of  Sephardi  cuisine.   It  was  quite  something  to  think  that  here  I  was,  sitting  in  an  Israeli  restaurant  on  an  island  in  the  Aegean  Sea  enjoying  an  ancient  Jewish  tradition  with  Greek  nationals,  Israelis  and  Americans.   The  next  day,  Carmen  Cohen,  who  runs  the  island’s  Jewish  Community  Centre,  invited  me  for  dinner.  I  was  enthralled  to  hear  her  life   experiences  and  the  challenges  she  faces  so  that  her  family  can  be  part  of  a  Jewish  com  munity.  Her  cousin,  Anna  Cohen,  is  the  propri  etor  of  a  jewellery  shop  which  is  the  only  Jewish  shop  on  the  island.  It  is  conveniently  located  around  the  corner  from  the  synagogue  and  is  full  of  exquisite  pieces.   While  I  was  on  Rhodes,  I  kept  asking  myself  what  keeps  this  community  together.  For  the  High  Holydays  they  bring  a  rabbi  from  Israel  to  conduct  the  services,  and  for  births  and  funer  als  a  rabbi  from  Athens  officiates.   There  seems  to  be  something  about  this  community,  both  present  and  past,  that  makes  one  feel  as  if  one  is  part  of  it,  whether  or  not  one  actually  lives  there.  This  is  particularly   evident  when  descendants  of  families  who  once  lived  on  Rhodes  make  a  point  of  going  back  to  the  island  to  hold  special  celebrations.  Just  recently,  60  members  of  a  family  flew  from  Atlanta,  USA,  to  hold  a  barmitzvah  there.   (Atlanta  was  a  popular  destination  for  many   of  the  2000  Jews  who  left  Rhodes  —  which  had  been  occupied  by  the  Italians  in  1912  —  on  the  eve  of  World  War  II,  the  other  popular  choices  being  the  Congo,  Southern  Rhodesia  and  South  America.  German  forces  occupied  the  island  in  1944,  and  about  1700  Jews  were  sent  to  the  Auschwitz  death  camp  from  Rhodes,  of  whom  only  about  150  survived.)   Although  I  spent  only  a  matter  of  days  on  the  island,  I  now  have  some  idea  of  the  magic  that  keeps  the  spirit  alive  on  Rhodes.  I  can  also  understand  how  that  spirit  attracts  and  holds  all  who  have  had  some  connection  with  it.  I  know  that  it  won’t  be  long  before  the  magnet  ism  of  this  community  draws  me  back.   ■  Lynne  Solomon  is  a  teacher  with  the  NSW  Adult  Migrant  English  Service. ",2000-09-22
"  Action  against  Indyk  touches  Jewish  nerve   Michael  Jordan   NEW  YORK:  In  light  of  several  recent  security  snafus,  Washington’s  intelligence  community  is  clearly  under  pressure  to  tighten  the  cordon   around  sensitive  material.   But  the  fact  that  the  first  diplomat  ensnared  in  the  dragnet  —  US  Ambassador  to  Israel  Martin  Indyk  —  happens  to  be  Jewish  and  a  controversial  conduit  in  the  Middle  East  peace  process  touches  a  nerve  for  American   Jews.   As  it  became  public  that  Indyk’s  security  clearance  had  been  suspended,  anxiety  that  Jews  may  again  be  accused  of  “dual  loyalty”  intermingled  with  conspiracy  theories  of  who   was  behind  it.   One  theory  pinned  it  on  the  Republicans,  in  an  effort  to  damage  the  Clinton  administration  and  the  Democrats’  bid  to  retain  the  White  House.  Another  suggested  that  it  was  co-ordi  nated  by  Israel’s  Likud  opposition  and  its  US  allies  who  are  trying  to  undermine  peace  negotiations.   As  the  Indyk  case  unfolds,  it  is  unclear  what  investigators  have  on  him,  if  it  will  end  his  ambassadorship  to  Israel  and  whether  it  will  have  any  impact  on  the  peace  process.   Ostensibly,  Indyk  is  accused  of  taking  clas  sified  work  home  with  him  and  using  a  laptop  that  did  not  have  security  clearance  —  actions  said  to  be  pervasive  in  the  diplomatic   corps.   Meanwhile,  American  Jewish  leaders  and  lobbyists  probed  sources  for  both  substance  and  scuttlebutt  behind  the  State  Department’s  attempted  assurances  that  there  is  “no  indica  tion  of  espionage”  and  no  “intelligence  infor  mation  has  been  compromised”.   The  crux  of  their  concern  was  summed  up  in  three  questions:   ■  Was  Indyk  singled  out?  ■  If  so,  why?   ■  And  why  now?   Jewish  sensitivity  to  the  “dual  loyalty”  accu  sation  is  not  unfounded,  say  Jewish  activists.  That  spectre  has  loomed  in  several  high-pro  file  investigations  against  American  Jews  over  the  years.   The  most  famous  is  the  Jonathan  Pollard  case.  A  former  US  Navy  intelligence  analyst,  Pollard  was  convicted  of  espionage  in  1985  for  passing  secret  US  military  information  to  Israel.  Despite  plea-bargaining,  he  was  given  a  life  sentence  —  a  move  which  some  Jews  say  smacked  of  antisemitism.  At  the  time,  other  American  Jews  involved  with  intelligence  were  reportedly  questioned  about  their  views  and  loyalties.   More  than  a  decade  later,  in  February  1997,  it  was  revealed  that  the  US  Army  was  investi  gating  David  Tenenbaum,  a  weapons  research  analyst,  for  allegedly  sharing  classified  docu  ments  with  Israeli  military  officials.  Tenenbaum,  who  was  never  charged,  is  suing  army  officials  for  being  singled  out  because  of  his  religion.   And  in  October  1997,  the  CIA  questioned  the  Jewish  connections  of  a  young  lawyer,  Adam  Ciralsky,  who  was  to  be  promoted  to  a  White  House  post.  Ciralsky  lost  his  job.  This  year,  he  sued  the  CIA,  claiming  that  rampant   US  Ambassador  to  Israel  Martin  Indyk  with  his  wife,  Jill,  and  children  Sarah  and  Jacob.   antisemitism  within  the  CIA  destroyed  his   career.   In  a  February  2000  segment  on  CBS’  60  Minutes  that  explored  the  Ciralsky  case,  an  unidentified  CIA  official  alleged  that  Israel  recruits  religious  American  Jews  to  spy  on  the   United  States.   Because  of  the  sensitivity,  Jewish  leaders  and  lobbyists  ferreting  out  information  from  Washington  are  being  unusually  tightlipped  about  what  their  sources  are  saying  about  Indyk.  They  were  reluctant  to  speculate  about  his  suspension,  opting  to  wait  for  more  details   to  emerge.   the  investigation  of  Indyk  tempers  the  boost  to  Jewish  self-esteem  provided  by   the  nomination  of  Joseph  Lieberman   Still,  most  agreed  that  as  Capitol  Hill  is  lean  ing  on  federal  agencies  to  crack  down  on  lax  security,  it  was  mere  coincidence  that  Indyk  was  the  first  to  be  exposed.  But  one  veteran  Jewish  leader  suspects  that  some  in  Washington  officialdom  are  engaging  in  ethnic  profiling.   “Coming  on  the  heels  of  the  Wen  Ho  Lee  sit  uation,  I  have  the  impression  that  the  intelli  gence  community  is  saying  ‘We’re  not  just  picking  on  someone  of  Chinese  ancestry  —  here’s  someone  of  Jewish  ancestry  who  we’re  focusing  on’,”  American  Jewish  leader  Seymour  Reich  said.  He  was  referring  to  a   recent  case  of  a  Chinese  American  scientist  who  was  indicted  for  security  violations,  detained  in  solitary  confinement  and  then  released  after  a  judge  chided  the  Justice  Department  for  mishandling  the  case.   Reich,  who  over  the  years  has  tried  to  win  Pollard’s  freedom,  added  that  the  case  against  Indyk  “seems  unfair”  and  that  Indyk  had  been  “singled  out.  Until  there’s  more  information,  that  will  be  the  lingering  impression  among  some  Jews.”   The  Jerusalem  Post  quoted  a  Democratic  congressional  aide  as  saying  that  Indyk  has  for  several  years  —  even  before  he  became   Ambassador  for  a  second  time  in  1999  —  been  warned  about  “his  lapses  in  securing  materi  als  and  handling  classified  material”.   As  for  who  else  could  be  behind  the  move   against  Indyk,  theories  abound.  Indyk  clearly  has  earned  his  share  of  enemies  across  the  political  spectrum.  In  the  Arab  world,  many  decried  his  past  employment  with  the  leading  pro-Israel  lobby  in  the  United  States,  the  American  Israel  Public  Affairs  Committee.  On  the  other  side,  Jews  resisting  any  concessions  to  the  Palestinians  have  branded  Indyk,  who  has  been  heavily  engaged  in  the  peace  process,  a  “Jewish  Arabist”.   Some  critics  couldn’t  resist  trying  to  con  nect  the  dots  between  a  speech  Indyk  made  last  month  in  Jerusalem  and  his  security  sus  pension.  In  a  speech  at  the  Reform  move  ment’s  Hebrew  Union  College,  Indyk  was  quoted  as  saying  that  Jerusalem  “is  not,  and  cannot,  be  the  exclusive  preserve  of  one  reli  gion,  and  the  solution  cannot  come  from  one  side  challenging  or  denying  another  side’s   beliefs”.   His  critics,  such  as  Morton  Klein,  president  of  the  Zionist  Organisation  of  America,  viewed  it  as  a  call  to  divide  Jerusalem.  “To  me,  it  seems  the  greatest  concern  with  regard  to  Indyk  is  not  the  most  recent  allegation  about  security,  but  about  Indyk’s  speech  in  which  he  supported  the  Arab  view  to  divide  Jerusalem,”   he  said.   Klein,  who  has  lobbied  for  Indyk’s  recall  during  the  past  week,  said  he  had  received  calls  from  supporters  congratulating  him  on  contributing  to  Indyk’s  suspension.  But  Klein  said  he  did  not  know  whether  there  was  a  con  nection  between  the  complaints  about  Indyk’s  remarks  and  the  move  against  him.   In  a  letter  to  the  Conference  of  Presidents  of  Major  Jewish  Organisations  last  week,  Indyk  sought  to  clarify  that  his  comments  were  not  out  of  line  with  US  policy.  “Some  journalists  chose  to  distort  my  remarks  and  convert  them  into  criticism  of  Israel,  which  they  were  not,”  he  wrote.  “Perhaps  my  meaning  would  have  been  clearer  if  I  had  added  that  Judaism  has  never  claimed  the  Holy  City  as  its  ‘exclu  sive  preserve’  and  that  Jews  have  never  chal  lenged  or  denied  another  side’s  beliefs.”   Other  Jewish  leaders  were  sceptical  that  the  speech  and  suspension  were  linked.  “I  haven’t  talked  to  anyone  who  would  lead  me  to  believe  that  it  was  anything  other  than  a  coincidence,  in  terms  of  the  timing,”  said  Martin  Raffel  of  the  Jewish  Council  for  Public  Affairs.  However,  “the  fact  that  no-one’s  said  that  there  isn’t  a  connection  doesn’t  mean  that  there  isn’t.”   However,  a  source  who  declined  to  be  iden  tified  said  a  second  ambassador  is  also  under  investigation.  His  case  has  not  been  publi  cised  because  he  serves  in  a  much  lower-pro  file  country  than  Indyk.   The  same  source  said  he  was  encouraged  by  the  pronouncements  of  the  State  Department  and  other  officials  that  Indyk  is  not  suspected  of  spying.  “In  a  case  where  they  normally  wouldn’t  be  saying  much,  it’s  signifi  cant  and  suggests  that  it  really  does  have  to  do  with  trying  to  meet  strict  security  needs,  not  with  violating  the  national  interest,”  said   the  source.   If  nothing  else,  said  Reich,  the  investigation  of  Indyk  tempers  the  boost  to  Jewish  self  esteem  provided  by  the  nomination  of  Joseph   Lieberman  as  the  Democratic  candidate  for  Vice-President.  “It  almost  brings  us  back  to  earth,  this  bubble  that  has  burst,”  said  Reich.  “Sure,  there  will  be  some  shivers  in  the  Jewish  community,  but  it  will  pass.”   JTA   ■  Next  week  —  The  strongest   influence  since  Kissinger ",2000-10-06
"  Rescue  of  Jewish  refugees  on  TV   LOS  ANGELES:  The  story  of  1000  Jewish  refugees  plucked  from  Europe  during  World  War  II  and  transported  to  safety  in  the  United  States   will  be  screened  as  a  four-hour  miniseries  on  CBS  Television  in  February  2001.   Haven,  which  features  Natasha  Richardson,  Anne  Bancroft,  Martin  Landau  and  Hal  Holbrook,  is  based  on  a  book  by  journalist  Ruth  Gruber.   In  1944,  Gruber,  an  assistant  to  US  Secretary  of  the  Interior  Harold  Ickes,  wrangled  an  assign  ment  to  escort  the  refugees  from  Italy  to  New  York.  The  rescue  of  the  refugees,  including  for  mer  concentration  camp  inmates,  was  a  one   time  gesture  by  US  President  Franklin  D  Roosevelt,  but  even  this  was  marred  by  the  atti   tudes  of  many  American  soldiers  and  officials.   Wounded  soldiers  aboard  the  ship  Henry  Gibbins  objected,  saying  the  space  should  have  been  reserved  for  their  wounded  comrades.  After  arriving  in  the  US,  the  refugees  were  herd  ed  into  a  virtual  prison  camp  near  Oswego,  New  York,  and  kept  there  until  the  end  of  the  war.   US  Government  officials,  fearing  a  backlash  if  more  Jews  were  admitted,  foiled  attempts  by  Gruber  to  publicise  the  plight  of  Jewish  refugees  and  grant  citizenship  to  those  held  in  the  camp.   Expected  to  be  included  in  the  film  is  rarely  seen  colour  footage  shot  by  American  camera  man  George  Stevens  immediately  after  the  liber   ation  of  the  Dachau  concentration  camp.

"  Give  him  credit,  urge  Jewish  leaders   JERUSALEM:  Give  the  Pope  credit  for  what  he  said,  rather  than  criticism  for  what  he  didn’t,  say  many  Jewish  lead   ers.   The  sight  of  the  leader  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  in  Israel  expressing  sadness  for  Christian  con  tributions  to  Jewish  persecution  moved  many  tg  tears.  But  did  Pope  John  Paul  II  utter  the  combination  of  words  that  would  tell  the  Jewish  peo  ple  —  a  half-century  later  —  not  only  that  the  Church  is  saddened,  but  also  sorry  for  its  silence  during  the   Holocaust?   In  a  ceremony  at  the  Yad  Vashem  Holocaust  Memorial,  the  Pope  said:  “I  assure  the  Jewish  people  that  the  Catholic  Church,  motivated  by  the  Gospel  law  of  truth  and  love  and  by  no  political  considerations,  is  deeply  sad  dened  by  the  hatred,  acts  of  persecu  tion  and  displays  of  antisemitism  directed  against  the  Jews  by  Christians  at  any  time  and  in  any  place.”   Many  Jewish  groups  and  leaders  said  the  Pope  could  have  gone  further  during  his  long-awaited  speech  at  Yad  Vashem.  Rabbi  David  Rosen,  director  of  the  Israel  office  of  the  Anti  Defamation  League  and  a  veteran  interfaith  activist,  said  he  would  have  been  pleased  if  the  Pope  had  used  stronger  language  about  the   Holocaust  and  issued  a  call  for  repen  tance  for  the  Church’s  silence  during  the  Holocaust.  “Nevertheless  it  was  a  very  important  moment.  The  signifi  cance  of  the  event  was  that  it  hap  pened,  and  he  said  the  words  he  said  where  he  was.”   Rabbi  Rosen  and  other  Jewish  lead  ers  say  Jews  should  acknowledge  how  far  the  Vatican  has  come  in  acknowledging  its  history  of  anti  semitism  and  the  contributions  of  Pope  John  Paul  II  to  Jewish-Catholic  reconciliation.   The  Pope’s  speech  at  Yad  Vashem  came  just  weeks  after  he  issued  a  broad  apology  for  sins  committed  by  the  Church  throughout  the  ages.  That  speech,  delivered  at  the  Vatican,  included  sins  against  the  Jews,  but  did   not  mention  the  Holocaust.   Many  who  criticised  those  remarks  for  stopping  short  of  a  specific  apolo  gy  for  the  Holocaust  had  hoped  to  hear  more  from  his  speech  at  Yad  Vashem.  As  the  eternal  flame  flickered  at  Yad  Vashem’s  vast  Hall  of  Remembrance,  the  Pope  laid  a  wreath  in  memory  of  the  six  million  Jews  slaughtered  during  the  Holocaust.  “There  are  no  words  strong  enough  to  deplore  the  terrible  tragedy  of  the  Shoah,”  the  Pope  said.  “I  have  come  to  Yad  Vashem  to  pay  homage  to  the  mil  lions  of  Jewish  people  who,  stripped   of  everything,  especially  of  their  human  dignity,  were  murdered  in  the   Holocaust.”   To  Seymour  Reich,  the  Pope’s  speech  didn’t  go  far  enough.  “I  was  disappointed  that  he  did  not  address  the  silence  of  the  Church  during  the  Holocaust,”  said  the  chairman  of  the  International  Jewish  Committee  for  Inter-religious  Consultations.  “It  was  a  lost  opportunity.”   But  Rabbi  Rosen  believes  it  was   “unrealistic”  for  the  Pope  to  say  more.  “Anybody  who  expected  him  to  dis   tance  himself  from  the  Church  or  Pius   XII  doesn’t  understand  the  theological  frame  of  reference  of  this  Pope.”   The  papal  visit  was  seen  as  further  recognition  by  the  Vatican  of  Israel,  with  which  diplomatic  relations  were  established  in  1993.  During  the  last  papal  visit  to  Israel  in  1964,  Pope  Paul  VI  did  not  go  to  Western  Jerusalem,  and  sent  a  letter  to  Israel’s  President  addressed  to  Tel  Aviv.   The  Pope  also  met  with  Israel’s  Chief  Rabbis  at  their  offices  in  Jerusalem.  The  rabbis  presented  the  Pope  with  a  Bible,  inscribed  with  a  dedication  from  the  book  of  the  Prophet  Micah:  “For  all  the  people  who  will  walk,  everyone  in  the  name  of  his  God,  and  we  will  walk  in  the  name  of  the  Lord,  our  God.  forever   and  ever”.

"  Jewish  names  on  BRW  Rich  List   Victor  Kleerekoper   ALMOST  a  quarter  of  the  people  named  in  this  year’s  BRW  Rich  200  List  are  members  of  the  Australian  Jewish  community.   Sydney  shopping-centre  king  Frank  Lowy  retained  his  place  as  Australia’s  second-richest  man  ($2.8  billion)  after  Kerry  Packer  ($8.2bn),  and  followed  by  Melbourne’s  Richard  Pratt  ($2.7bn)  in  third  place.   The  list  noted  three  “new  billion  aires”  —  all  Jewish  —  Melbourne’s  Boris  Liberman  ($1.3bn),  Sydney’s  Harry  Triguboff  ($1.2bn)  (again)  and  Melbourne’s  John  Gandel  ($1.1  bn).   Solomon  Lew  is  14th  on  the  list,  with  Marc  Besen  17th  and  Maurice  Alter  36th.  The  Smorgon  family,  with  an  estimated  wealth  of  $2.07bn,  is  Australia’s  richest  fami  ly  group,  with  the  family  of  the  late  John  Saunders  fourth  and  the  Scheinberg  family  ninth.   Federation  of  Jewish  Community  Services  executive  officer  Anton  Herman  said  the  percentage  of  Jews  on  the  list  created  the  poten  tial  for  growth  in  philanthropic  support  for  the  neediest  members  of  the  community.  “The  communi  ty  is  immensely  generous  one,  and  we  hope  the  tradition  of  tzedakar  will  continue  to  develop,”  he  said.   “The  Pratt  Foundation’s  reorien   tation  of  philanthropic  priorities   towards  social  services  is  a  case  in   point.  There  is  a  growing  gap  between  the  rich  and  the  needy,  and  sight  should  not  be  lost  of  the  fact  that  13  percent  of  Jewish  fam  ilies  in  Australia  have  a  combined   income  of  less  than  $400  per  week.

"  Disbelief  as  Jewish   arsonists  attack  shule   JERUSALEM:  On  Shabbat  morning,  Ya’ar  Ramot  Synagogue  overflowed  with  people,  including  visitors  from  overseas  who  had  come  to  cele  brate  the  batmitzvah  of  Kayli  Messinger.  Less  than  24  hours  later,  Gail  Auslander,  a  member  of  the  congregation  for  two  decades,  stood  on  the  same  spot,  contemplating  charred  upholstery  and  prayer-books  amid  ash  and  broken  glass.   In  an  arson  attack  last  Saturday,  the  Masorti  (Conservative)  synagogue  was  set  on  fire.  The  arsonists  failed  to  do  structural  damage,  but  the  furniture,  ceiling  and  air-conditioning  system  were  all  damaged.  “It’s  beyond  belief  that  Jews  could  do  this,”  said  Ms  Auslander.   About  200  congregants  and  supporters  held  a  rally  at  the  site  under  the  slogan  “Let’s  put  out  the  fire”.  “I  feel  a  sense  of  helplessness  living  in  a  society  of  Jews  where  someone  would  do  that  to  a  synagogue,  regardless  of  their  religious  differ  ences,”  said  Paul  Messinger,  Kayli’s  father.   Condemning  the  attack,  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  said:  “The  act  is  especially  shocking,  hav  ing  taken  place  in  Jerusalem,  the  eternal  capital  of  the  state  of  Israel  and  the  Jewish  people.”   Jerusalem  police  appointed  a  special  team  to  investigate  the  crime  and  to  probe  whether  there  is  a  link  between  the  arson  and  a  burglary  yesterday  at  a  synagogue  belonging  to  the  mes   sianic  movement  in  downtown  Jerusalem.   Minister  Michael  Melchior  visited  the  scene,  flanked  by  Conservative  Movement  president  Rabbi  Ehud  Bandel  and  Jewish  Agency  chair  man  Sallai  Meridor.  Meridor  spent  several  hours  at  Ya’ar  Ramot  after  the  Jewish  Agency  board  of  governors  committee  on  the  unity  of  die  Jewish  people  relocated  its  session  to  the  synagogue  in  a  show  of  solidarity.   Melchior  said  “the  lack  of  tolerance  that  leads  to  violence  is  a  disturbing  symptom  in  Israeli  society.  Just  as  we  condemn  assaults  on  syna  gogues  in  Europe,  we  must  display  vehemence  in  our  condemnation  of  this  act  and  explore  all  necessary  means  to  bring  the  guilty  to  justice.”   Ashkenazi  Chief  Rabbi  Yisrael  Lau  said  he  con   Burnt  prayer-books  at  the  damaged  Conservative  synagogue  in  Jerusalem.   demned  “any  act  of  violence,  whether  it  is  against  a  man’s  dignity,  his  property,  not  to  men  tion  his  life,  whether  committed  against  a  build  ing,  or  a  building  designated  for  the  prayer  of  the  members  of  a  movement  like  this  one  or  any  other”.  He  noted  that  this  condemnation  had  no  connection  to  his  views  on  the  different  move  ments  within  Judaism.   Jerusalem  Mayor  Ehud  Olmert  rejected  criti  cism  that  he  had  been  too  slow  and  too  evasive  in  responding  to  the  attack.  “It  is  not  respectful  for  you  to  rub  this  in  beyond  the  appropriate  level,”  he  told  Herzberger,  after  complaints  that  he  had  ignored  the  congregation’s  request  for  a  response  after  a  previous  arson  attempt.  Although  he  said  he  was  “shocked  and  dis  turbed”,  he  refrained  from  describing  the  arson  as  a  hate  crime  or  identifying  a  group  of  people  who  might  be  responsible.  “If  we  want  to  build  a  better  atmosphere,  we  must  be  careful  of  what   we  say,  saia  uimert.

"  News   Jewish  role  in  reconciliation  applauded   Stefan  BiaiogusSd   THE  Australian  Jewish  community  was  applaud  ed  at  the  Corroboree  2000  at  the  Opera  House  on  Saturday  for  its  steadfast  support  of  Aboriginal  reconciliation.   Master  of  Ceremonies  Ray  Martin  (a  member  of  the  Council  for  Aboriginal  Reconciliation  and  a  Channel  Nine  broadcaster)  read  out  part  of  a  goodwill  message  to  the  2000-strong  audience  from  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  national  vice-president  Jeremy  Jones.   Mr  Martin  then  added:  “The  Jewish  communi  ty  are  very  strong  supporters  of  reconciliation,  and  they  have  been  with  us  from  the  beginning.  Because  of  the  Sabbath  they  can’t  be  here  with  us,  but  they  are  with  us  in  spirit.”   The  remarks  received  resounding  applause   from  the  audience.   However,  Jews  were  very  much  in  evidence  at  the  Walk  for  Reconciliation  across  the  Harbour  Bridge  on  Sunday.  Among  the  250,000  people  demonstrating  support  for  justice  for  Australia’s  indigenous  people  were  about  100  members  of  Temple  Emanuel,  as  well  as  numerous  represen  tatives  of  JewishCare,  Wizo,  B’nai  B’rith,  Masada  College,  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  and  Jews  for  Ethnic  Tolerance,  all  carrying  their  ban  ners.  Many  more  community  identities  walked  as  individuals,  including  Great  Synagogue  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  and  his  wife  Marian,  Central  Synagogue  Rabbi  Selwyn  Franklin,  former  ECAJ  presidents  Diane  Shteinman  and  Dr  Joachim  Schneeweiss,  his  wife  Sybil  Schneeweiss  and  journalists  Geraldine  Brooks  and  Tony  Horwitz.   The  mood  evoked  the  words  of  the  psalm  read  out  in  Central  Synagogue  in  recognition  of  the  event:  “Behold  how  good  and  pleasant  it  is  for  brothers  and  sisters  to  live  together  in  unity”.   Board  president  Peter  Wertheim  and  JewishCare  CEO  Steven  Denenberg  both  summed  up  the  day  as  “wonderful”.   Mr  Wertheim:  “We  were  applauded  by  many  groups  on  the  walk  and  by  indigenous  groups  as  well.  We  were  proud  to  be  there.  It’s  not  a  ques  tion  of  guilt  or  shame;  we  were  there  because  it  was  the  right  and  honourable  thing  to  do.”   Mr  Denenberg:  “People  from  everywhere  identified  with  us,  many  cheered  and  some  came  over  to  have  their  photographs  taken  with   us.”   Ms  Brooks,  who  has  written  widely  on  the  Middle  East,  remarked  that  “it  was  the  bigeest  crowd  I’ve  seen  since  the  Ayatollah’s  funeral!”   Rabbi  Apple:  “It  was  one  of  the  defining  moments  of  my  life,  to  see  250,000  people  spon  taneously  showing  that  there  has  been  an  injus   Members  of  the  Jewish  community  out  in  force  at  the  Walk  for  Reconconciliation  over  the  Harbour  Bridge.

A  leader  sometimes  has  to  say  what  needs  to  be  said  and  to  try  to  mould  public  opinion,  and  not  just  wait  until  circumstances  push  them  into  a  reluctant  admission  of  a  new  point  of  view.”   Rabbi  Apple  said  he  would  like  to  have  seen  a  broad  Jewish  community  presence  organised  to  show  that  loyalties  within  the  community  “are  irrelevant  when  it  comes  to  broad  issues  of  national  morality.  This  is  totally  a  moral  issue.  There’s  no  such  thing  as  left-wing  or  right-wing  at  this  point  in  black-white  relations  in  Australia.   “Jews  have  always  believed  that  humans  deserve  justice,  and  this  is  a  case  where  indige  nous  human  beings  have  been  denied  justice.  We  have  a  moral  imperative  to  say  what  we   i  Pictures,  next  week   believe  and  be  seen  to  say  it.  Also,  we  have  such  a  long  experience  of  being  denied  the  opportu  nity  of  living  in  a  just  society  that  we  feel  kinship  with  those,  such  as  indigenous  Australians,  who  are  struggling  as  we  have  had  to  struggle.”   NSW  Democrats  Senator  Aden  Ridgeway  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  it  was  “liberat   I  Different  women,   similar  stories,  page  9   ing”  to  see  so  many  thousands  gather  in  sup  port  of  Aboriginal  rights,  for  it  showed  that  the  hard  work  had  been  worthwhile,  that  the  pub  lic  had  been  touched  by  the  stories  of  the  Stolen  Generation  and  other  injustices.  “It’s  exhilarating  that  on  such  a  cold  winter’s  day,   people  have  shown  the  warmth  of  their  hearts.”   He  too  acknowledged  the  role  played  by  the  Jewish  community  in  supporting  the  reconcilia  tion  process.  “One  of  the  tremendous  contribu  tions  from  the  Jewish  community  is  that  they  have  taught  us  by  example  of  the  importance  of  talking  the  truth  and  remembering  the  past.  Today’s  event  is  about  the  celebration  of  memo  ry  and  becoming  the  people  we  are  by  defining  our  experiences.  The  Jewish  community  have  contributed  to  our  coming  to  our  proper  posi  tion  in  Australian  society  by  their  support,  by  responses  provided  in  different  battles  along  the  way,  for  example  native  title  and  the  response  to  Wik  and  Mabo,  and  a  need  for  shared  remem  bering.”   Dr  Schneeweiss  said  the  Prime  Minister  had  “lost  a  wonderful  opportunity  to  make  amends”.

"  Renowned  Moscow  Jewish  Choir  to  perform   The  faces  of  the  Moscow  Chamber  Jewish  Choir.   THE  Moscow  Chamber  Jewish   Choir  —  which  has  performed  around  the  world  with  such  illustrious  names  as  Placido  Domingo,  Julio  Iglesias  and  Zubin  Mehta  —  will  give  a  concert  at  Central  Synagogue  on   June  15.   Cantor  Shimon  Farkas  and  Bob  Borowsky  will  make  guest  appear  ances  with  the  choir,  which  was  estab  lished  10  years  ago  as  part  of  a  pro  gram  designed  to  revive  the  art  of  can  toral  and  synagogue  choral  music  in   Russia.   Support  came  from  the  American  Joint  Distribution  Committee  and  Moscow  Rabbi  Adolph  Shayevich,  and  the  choir  made  its  debut  at  Moscow  Choral  Synagogue  in  1990,  with  Michael  Tourestski  appointed  conduc   tor.   The  choir  immediately  made  an  impact  and  began  to  receive  requests  to  perform  around  the  world.  Its  con  certs  have  inspired  and  stirred  audi  ences  in  England,  France,  Israel,  Spain,  Poland,  Holland,  Germany,  Belgium,  Canada  and  the  United  States.  In  its  first  four  years,  it  gave  180  concerts  in  22  states  across  the  US,  some  of  them  with  well-known  Cantors  Joseph  Malovani,  David  Bagly,  Benjamin  Miller  and  Abe  Nadel.  In  Atlanta  and  Miami  Beach,  the  choir  was  honoured  with  the  status  of  Residents  of  the  City.   In  1992  the  choir  participated  in  the  Por  Me  Espiritu  Festival  in  Toledo,  Spain,  dedicated  to  the  500th  anniver  sary  of  the  expulsion  from  Spain.  The  Queen  of  Spain  and  representatives  of  China,  Morocco,  France,  Greece  and  various  other  nations  were  present.  The  program  contained  such  masters  as  Placido  Domingo,  Isaac  Stem  and   Zubin  Mehta.   The  members  of  the  choir  have  founded  a  children’s  choir  at  Moscow’s  Jewish  school,  as  well  as  a  musical  college  attached  to  the  syna  gogue,  where  children  are  trained  in  singing,  piano,  violin  and  synthesiser.   In  Florida,  the  choir  received  such  an  enthusiastic  response  that  the  day  of  its  performance  was  declared  “The  Day  of  the  Moscow  Jewish  Choir”.   The  choir  sings  a  full  range  of  music,  its  repertoire  including  new  Jewish  hits,  both  religious  and  secular.   In  1997  the  City  of  Moscow  hon  oured  the  choir  by  declaring  it  a  state   institution.   Apart  from  his  outstanding  ability  and  stage  artistry,  Tourestski  set  up  a  conducting  school,  and  in  1993  was  presented  with  the  Golden  Crown  of  the  Cantors  of  the  World  award  by  the  American  Cantors  Association.   The  members  of  the  choir  have  acquired  a  high  level  of  musical  edu  cation.  Many  have  gone  on  to  under  take  solo  cantorial  careers  in  syna  gogues  in  Israel,  Canada  and  the  United  States.   The  choir  is  characterised  by  the  variety  of  the  timbres,  particularly  in  the  tenor  ranges,  its  culture  —  and  its   sense  of  humour.   “The  joy  and  the  significance  of  the  Moscow  Jewish  Choir  is  firstly,  that  it   is  possible  to  be  Jewish  in  Russia  today,  and  secondly,  that  the  visit  to  Sydney  will  bring  together  Russian  Jews  and  Sydney  Jewry,”  choir  pro  moter  Garry  Volk  said  this  week.

"  Jewish  Studies  under  review  at  Masada   Shira  Sebban   MASADA  College  is  to  embark  on  a  compre  hensive  review  of  its  Jewish  Studies  curricu  lum  from  next  week.   “Masada  is  the  only  school  on  the  north  shore  which  can  genuinely  be  a  Jewish  school  and  not  just  a  school  for  Jews,""  said  Sydney  University  Jewish  Studies  lecturer  Leanne  Piggott,  who  will  manage  the  first  phase  of  the  review.   “The  Jewish  Studies  programs  at  this  school  and  other  dayschools  are  far  from  ideal.  We  know  this  because  of  a  wealth  of  anecdotal  evidence  that  alarming  numbers  of  students  at  the  dayschools,  including  Masada,  report  that  they  are  being  ‘turned  off’  Jewish  learning,  instead  of  being  inspired  by  it,  as  they  should  be.  Only  a  tiny  propor  tion  of  dayschool  graduates  go  on  to  higher  Jewish  Studies  at  university  or  elsewhere.  A  Jewish  community  that  is  unable  or,  worse,  unwilling,  to  foster  higher  Jewish  learning  in  any  meaningful  numbers  faces  a  very  serious  continuity  problem.”   There  will  be  three  phases  of  the  review,  the  first  one  being  a  three-month  consultancy  project  in  which  Ms  Piggott  will  facilitate  a  team  of  Jewish  educators,  including  Shalom  College  chief  executive  officer  Dr  Hilton  Immerman  and  Academy  BJE  principal  Lilly  Maltz.  The  working  group  will  be  chaired  by  Masada  spiritual  dean  Rabbi  David  Rogut  and  will  involve  Masada  Jewish  Studies  staff.   The  evaluation  of  the  Jewish  Studies  pro  gram  will  assess  the  strengths  and  weakness  es  of  the  curriculum  to  determine  which  areas  need  change,  and  will  “find  a  way  to  integrate  more  effectively  the  secular  and  Jewish  Studies  curricula”,  Ms  Piggott  said.   The  second  phase  will  be  the  implementa  tion  of  the  recommendations  —  expected  at  the  start  of  the  2001  academic  year  —  and  the  third  phase  will  entail  devising  a  process  to  monitor  the  program.   Masada  principal  Frank  Larkin  said  the  review  is  “one  of  the  best  things  to  happen  to   Leanne  Piggott...  “Alarming  numbers  of  students  at  the  dayschools  report  that  they  are  being  “turned  off’  Jewish  learning.”   our  college,  if  not  to  Jewish  education  in  Sydney.  Our  intention  is  to  develop  a  pro  gram  which  will  be  the  benchmark  for  Jewish  Studies  in  Sydney,  if  not  Australia.”   Masada  continually  assesses  its  programs,  both  Jewish  and  secular,  he  said.  “We’re  con  stantly  looking  at  our  programs  and  making  changes.  Instead  of  doing  this  in  a  piecemeal  way  or  tinkering  around  the  edges,  we’ve  decided  to  take  a  really  good  look  at  our  Jewish  Studies  program  and  come  up  with  one  that’s  integrated  from  Years  K-12,  child  focused  and  outcomes-based.  In  a  lot  of  our  programming,  including  Jewish  Studies,  we’ve  been  trying  to  do  that.  The  time  has  come  to  look  at  our  program  and  make  sure  we’re  doing  the  things  we  say  we’re  doing  and  come  up  with  a  program  which  is   Frank  Larkin  ...  “One  of  the  best  things  to  happen  to  our  college,  if  not  to  Jewish  education  in  Sydney.""   vibrant,  relevant  to  our  children  and  meets  the  needs  of  our  community.   “We’re  not  just  tossing  out  the  old  and  replacing  it  with  something  completely  new  because  a  lot  of  what  we  do  has  value,  which  can  be  seen  in  our  children’s  involvement  in  the  religious  community  outside  of  school   time.”   Mr  Larkin  pointed  to  the  involvement  of  Masada  students  in  synagogues  and  youth  movements.  “About  two-thirds  of  the  North  Shore  Synagogue  choir  is  made  up  of  our  stu  dents,  and  on  Friday  nights,  hundreds  of  chil  dren  attend  services  at  Kehillat  Masada.  Large  numbers  of  children  put  in  time,  ener  gy  and  effort  into  celebrating  the  chaggim,  and  the  numbers  of  students  going  on  the  Israel  Study  Tour  is  increasing.”   Masada  president  Carin  Cohen  agreed:  “We’re  continuing  to  pursue  excellence  in  every  department.  The  Jewish  ethos  is  the  school’s  raison  d’etre,  and  it’s  important  that  we  continue  to  ensure  that  our  Jewish  Studies  Department  has  a  leading  edge.  There’s  no  perfect  solution  to  anything.  We’re  looking  to  continue  to  secure  the  school’s  Jewish  future.  We  have  a  solid  prod  uct,  but  there’s  nothing  wrong  with  taking  a  fresh  look  at  what  we  have  and  moving  for   ward.”   Ms  Piggott:  “At  every  step,  Jewish  Studies  teachers  will  be  included  as  a  critical  part  of  the  process.  It’s  envisaged  that  such  a  collab  orative  effort  of  Jewish  educators  from  terti  ary  and  secondary  sectors  will  provide  a  ‘fil  tered-down’  effect  from  staff  of  Jewish  higher  education  to  Masada.  This  is  the  ideal  model  of  communal  education  at  work,  and  Masada  will  be  obtaining  the  best  possible  input,  independent  of  the  existing  school  system.”   Rabbi  Rogut,  director  of  Jewish  Studies  for  Years  K-12,  described  the  review  as  a  “con  structive  attempt  by  the  school  and  the  board  to  look  formally  at  all  facets  of  Jewish  Studies.  Masada  constantly  reviews;  we  want  to  ensure  that  we’re  giving  students  the  best.  It  may  be  that  much  of  what  we’re  doing  is  more  than  adequate;  we  want  to  look  at  it  in  a  comprehensive  way  in  case  there  are  areas  we  could  improve  on.”   Masada  pupils  in  Years  1-6  devote  ten  40  minute  periods  over  a  ten-day  cycle  to  Jewish  Studies  —  half  to  Hebrew  and  half  to  Tanach  and  Judaism.  Students  in  Years  7-10  undertake  12  one-hour  periods  over  a  ten  day  cycle  —  three  on  Tanach,  two  on  Jewish  Studies,  five  on  Hebrew  and  two  on  Jewish  history.  In  the  first  three  terms  of  Year  11,  stu  dents  can  choose  between  Tanach,  Classical  or  Modern  Hebrew,  Studies  of  Religion  or  a  combination,  to  which  they  devote  eight  hours  over  ten  days,  before  embarking  on  the   HSC  curriculum.   The  working  group’s  recommendations  should  be  available  by  October. ",2000-07-14
"  Stefan  BSaSoguski   NEWS  of  Jodi  and  Gavin  Samuels’  departure  from  Sydney  for  New  York  must  have  momen  tarily  filled  hundreds  of  hearts  with  trepidation  as  the  beneficiaries  of  their  legendary  hospitali  ty  wondered  what  they  would  end  up  doing  for   Shabbat  dinner  or  lunch.   As  it  happens  there  is  no  need  to  worry  as  the  Aish  HaTorah  torch  has  been  handed  on  to  for  mer  assistant  Hillel  director  Lauren  Levy  and  a  team  of  helpers.   In  the  nearly  two  years  that  the  Samuels  were  in  Sydney  they  devoted  every  spare  moment  to  bringing  young  people  closer  to  their  Jewish  her  itage.  Ms  Samuels  told  the  AJN  the  secret  of  how  they  managed  to  organise  Shabbat  hospitality  for  dozens  of  people  every  week,  as  well  as  vari  ous  other  social  and  learning  opportunities,  jug  gling  all  that  with  studying  for  MBAs  and  work  ing.   “I  don’t  sleep!  Gavin  used  to  sleep  a  lot  but  doesn’t  any  more.  We  survive  on  four  to  five  hours  sleep  a  night.  We  don’t  know  what  it  means  to  relax  or  to  go  out  and  do  things  like  normal  people.”   All  that  work  paid  off,  attracting,  she  said,  more  than  1000  new  faces  to  functions  organised  under  the  auspices  of  Aish  HaTorah,  the  Old  City  of  Jerusalem-based  yeshiva  that  specialises  in  outreach.   Jodi  and  Gavin  Samuels.   Every  Shabbat,  the  couple  would  host  up  to  30  people  for  dinner  and  then  again  for  lunch  and  organise  a  monthly  Shabbat  dinner  for  up  to  100  people.  They  also  established  educational  programs  such  as  Aish  Diva  for  women,  Aish  Whizz,  and  the  Clash  social  functions  for  people  “to  eat,  drink,  laugh  and  think”.  They  organised  overseas  speakers  to  come  to  Sydney,  and  recruited  people  for  Aish’s  Israel  Program,  a  five  week  program  in  Israel  for  undergraduates,  which  introduces  them  to  the  yeshiva’s  distinc  tive  philosophical  approach  to  Judaism.   One  of  the  main  events  marking  Ms  Levy’s  tak  ing  over  of  the  reins  is  the  introduction  to  Melbourne  and  Sydney  of  Aish’s  SpeedDating  program.  The  American  program  has  captured  the  imagination  of  media  around  the  world  with  the  way  participants  go  through  seven  “dates”  in   an  hour.   Originally  from  South  Africa,  the  Samuels  first  became  involved  with  Aish  while  living  in  Launceston  in  the  mid-’90s,  developing  their  association  while  living  on  the  Gold  Coast  and  then  Sydney.   Ms  Samuels:  “Coming  from  South  Africa,  where  we  had  been  very  involved  in  the  com  munity,  we  saw  a  big  gap  in  the  Australian  com  munity  and  saw  this  as  an  opportunity  to  give  back  what  we  had  gained  through  outreach  organisations  in  South  Africa.  It’s  been  a  great  opportunity  to  meet  Australian  Jews  from  right  across  the  spectrum,  which  I  think  a  lot  of  peo  ple  in  the  shomer  Shabbat  world  don’t  tend  to  do.  We’ve  had  an  opportunity  to  share  our  pas  sion  and  our  excitement.”   Although  sad  to  leave  Sydney,  she  said  she  was  looking  forward  to  going  to  New  York—but  she  has  told  Aish  that  she  needs  a  holiday  before  taking  up  their  offer  of  working  full-time  in  their  new  office  on  the  Upper  East  Side.   “I’m  excited  to  explore  the  diversity  of  Jewish  opportunities  that  exist  in  New  York,  but  I’m  also  very  sad.  When  you  devote  so  much  to  a  com  munity  then  you  get  quite  attached,  and  we  have  given  everything  to  the  Sydney  community,  so  I’m  very  emotional  about  leaving.” ",2000-07-21
"  International   Jewish  concerns  over  Bush  team   MsttaBsiger   WASHINGTON:  Flying  above  the  West  Bank  and  visiting  the  Golan  Heights  during  a  1998  trip  to  Israel,  George  W  Bush  apparently  began  to  see  the  complexities  of  the  Middle  East   “It  was  truly  an  educational  trip”  for  the  Texas  Governor,  said  Cliff  Sobel,  who  cochaired  the  Jewish  community  outreach  program  for  Bush’s  presidential  campaign  and  accompanied  Bush  and  several  other  Republican  governors  on  that   visit.   But  the  Middle  East  has  changed  dramatically  in  the  24  months  since  Bush’s  trip  to  Israel,  which  included  a  lengthy  discussion  with  then  Prime  Minister  Binyamin  Netanyahu.  There  is  a  new  Israeli  leader,  whose  short  tenure  could  be  cut  shorter  by  early  elections,  and  the  region’s  attempts  at  peace  have  been  knocked  down  sev  eral  notches.   life  has  changed  for  the  Governor  too.  He  is  now,  in  his  eyes  and  the  eyes  of  many,  President  elect  of  the  United  States.  As  the  legal  battle  over  the  votes  in  Florida  draws  to  a  conclusion,  Bush  and  running  mate  Dick  Cheney  have  begun  iden  tifying  key  members  of  a  Bush  administration.  More  names  will  surface  in  the  next  several  weeks.   In  the  Jewish  community,  all  eyes  are  on  Bush’s  likely  nominees  to  signal  the  direction  of  his  international  and  domestic  policies.  The  next  President  will  face  a  shaky  political  climate  in  the  Middle  East,  as  well  as  numerous  divisive  domestic  issues,  including  issues  related  to  the  separation  of  Church  and  State.   Equally  significant,  Bush  may  be  in  a  position  to  choose  as  many  as  three  new  members  of  the  US  Supreme  Court.   While  cautious  not  to  anoint  Bush  the  winner  until  Vice-President  A1  Gore  concedes,  Jewish  activists  and  analysts  are  beginning  to  speculate   on  the  new  and  familiar  faces  that  could  be  included  in  a  Bush  administration.   “The  first  thing  George  W  Bush  has  to  do  is  pick  a  team,”  said  Diana  Aviv  of  the  United  Jewish  Communities.  “In  many  ways,  his  philoso  phies  are  going  to  be  translated  by  the  team  he  puts  together.”   Key  Jewish  names  being  mentioned  for  cabi  net  posts  are  Stephen  Goldsmith,  the  former  Mayor  of  Indianapolis  who  has  been  Bush’s  domestic  policy  guru,  and  Paul  Wolfowitz,  an  Under-Secretary  of  Defence  during  the  adminis  tration  of  Bush’s  father,  George  Bush.   During  the  campaign,  George  W  Bush  voiced  strong  support  for  Israel  and  a  role  for  the  United  States  as  a  mediator  in  regional  peace  negotia  tions.  But  by  and  large,  the  Texas  Governor  is  untested  in  foreign  policy  in  general,  and  the  Middle  East  in  particular.   Some  Jewish  leaders  will  be  watching  to  deter  mine  whether  Bush  acts  to  move  the  US  Embassy  from  Tel  Aviv  to  Jerusalem,  which  he  promised  to  do  during  the  campaign.  Congress  has  legislated  such  a  move,  but  the  Clinton  administration  put  it  off,  saying  it  would  jeopar  dise  the  peace  process.   Bush’s  action  on  the  embassy  will  be  a  key  opening-round  test  of  the  new  Bush  presidency,  said  Jewish  leader  Malcolm  Hoenlein.  “I  think  we  will  look  at  the  kind  of  outreach  that  goes  on  to  our  community.”   Most  analysts  predict  that  Bush  will  not  devote  the  same  level  of  time  and  energy  to  the  Middle  East  conflict  that  President  Bill  Clinton  did.  To  the  extent  that  a  Bush  administration  focuses  on  the  region,  the  job  is  likely  to  fall  to  the  State  Department.   Bush’s  chief  foreign  policy  advisers  during  the  campaign  were  Wolfowitz,  General  Colin  Powell,   former  chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  and  Condoleezza  Rice,  a  Stanford  University  profes  sor  who  served  on  the  National  Security  Council   Texas  Governor  George  W  Bush,  centre,  flanked  by  Utah  Governor  Mike  Leavitt,  left,  and  Republican   Jewish  Coalition  Executive  Director  Matthew  Brooks,  visits  tire  Western  Wall  In  Jerusalem  during  a  1998   tour  of  Israel  for  Republican  governors.

Powell,  believed  to  be  the  leading  contender  for  Secretary  of  State,  was  chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  during  the  Gulf  War,  and  apparent  ly  developed  good  relations  with  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak,  who  was  Israel’s  top  mili  tary  man  at  the  time.  Powell,  however,  has  not  had  much  experience  in  diplomacy.   Rice,  who  visited  Israel  this  year,  is  Bush’s  like  ly  national  security  adviser.  In  interviews  during  the  campaign,  she  reiterated  Bush’s  belief  in  American  solidarity  with  Israel,  but  said  the  White  House  must  allow  the  parties  themselves  to  set  the  pace  of  peace  talks.   “You  want  this  period  to  unfold  in  a  way  that  secures  Israel,  and  you  have  to  trust  Israel  to  make  decisions  about  its  own  security,”  Rice  told  the  New  Jersey  Jewish  News  in  September.   Tom  Neumann  of  the  Jewish  Institute  for  National  Security  Affairs  said  he  is  concerned  that  neither  Powell  nor  Rice  has  a  strong  diplo  matic  track  record.  But  Bush  has  an  opportunity  to  delve  into  Middle  East  issues  with  a  clean  slate,  he  added.  “This  is  an  opportunity  to  come  in  and  start  afresh,”  he  said.  Bush  “does  not  have  a  stake”  in  whether  the  Oslo  process,  which  began  under  the  Clinton  administration  and  has  seemingly  collapsed,  works.   Meanwhile,  Jewish  observers  will  be  watching  to  see  what  role,  if  any,  is  given  to  James  Baker,  the  former  Secretary  of  State  who  emerged  as  a  key  member  of  the  Bush  team  during  the  Florida  legal  wrangling  over  vote  counts.   Baker,  regarded  by  many  Jews  as  hostile  to  Israel,  incurred  the  wrath  of  the  established  Jewish  community  during  a  nasty  fight  over  loan   guarantees  to  Israel  in  1991.   Observers  will  also  be  watching  for  gestures  made  to  the  Arab  American  community,  which  gave  Bush  strong  support  in  the  election.  Jewish  activists  say  Bush  will  have  to  straddle  a  working  relationship  between  the  Jewish  community  and   Arab-Americans.   Matt  Brooks  of  the  Republican  Jewish  Coalition  expects  a  change  in  the  role  which  the  United  States  will  play  on  issues  related  to  the  Middle  East.  Bush  “realises  Israel  has  to  make  its  own  decisions  on  the  pace  of  the  peace  process”,  he  said.  “We’re  not  going  to  force  Israel   to  conform  to  our  timetable.”   He  said  recent  actions  by  Palestinian  leaders  call  into  question  their  commitment  to  peace,  and  Brooks  said  the  United  States  may  have  moved  too  fast  under  Clinton.   On  the  domestic  front,  a  Bush  White  House  will  be  forced  to  face  a  sometimes  bitterly  divided  Congress.  The  task  is  likely  to  be  even  more   daunting,  given  the  contentious  outcome  of  the  election.  Analysts  say  Bush’s  campaign  theme  of  serving  as  a  “uniter,  not  a  divider”  will  be  put  to   the  test   “The  healing  in  Congress  and  bipartisanship  has  been  very  important  to  him,”  said  Aviv.  “He  ought  to  pick  up  on  issues  with  consensus.”   Analysts  believe  that  compromise  will  be  nec  essary  to  quell  some  hot-button  issues  in  the  107th  Congress,  including  gun  control,  social  security  and  Medicare.  “You’re  not  going  to  see  massive  changes  in  the  legislative  process  because  the  margins  are  too  narrow,”  said  Ira   Forman  of  the  National  Jewish  Democratic  Council.   Also  potentially  explosive  could  be  nomina  tions  to  the  Supreme  Court  and  other  federal  benches.  The  Democrats  have  enough  votes  in  the  Senate  to  block  some  conservative  nomina  tions.  “Given  the  close  division  in  the  Senate,  the  President  is  going  to  be  forced  to  the  middle  with  a  nomination,”  said  Marc  Stem  of  the  American  Jewish  Congress.  On  abortion,  Bush  is  pro-life,  but  a  few  moderate  Republicans  in  the  Senate  are  pro-choice.  The  White  House  may  be  forced  to  nominate  a  candidate  who  is  in  favour  of  leg  islative  restrictions  on  abortion,  Stem  said.   But  nominations  to  the  court  are  unpre  dictable.  A  Democratic  majority  in  the  Senate  in  1991  approved  Clarence  Thomas,  considered   one  of  the  more  conservative  members  of  the  current  court.   Bush  received  only  19  percent  of  Jewish  sup  port  in  the  election,  but  according  to  Sobel,  that  will  have  no  effect  on  the  importance  of  the  Jewish  constituency.  “I  know  that  Governor  Bush  does  not  look  at  polls  in  making  decisions,”  said  Sobel,  finance  chairman  of  Bush’s  New  Jersey  campaign.  “Whether  we  voted  less  or  more  for  the  Republican  ticket  would  not  make  a  difference  on  important  issues.”   Forman  said  it  is  natural  for  politicians  to  steer  away  from  groups  that  do  not  provide  a  great  deal  of  electoral  support,  but  he  said  he  still  thinks  the  Jewish  representation  in  a  Bush  White  House  will  be  greater  than  the  Jewish  proportion  of  the  country.  “The  Jewish  community  will  sur  vive  a  Republican  White  House,”  Forman  said.  “We  will  have  issues  that  we  won’t  be  happy   about,  but  we  will  survive  quite  well.

"  John  Hagelin  and  Nat  GokJhaber  raise  their  arms  in  victory  after  being  selected  as  the  presidential  and  vice-presidential  nominees  by  the  Reform  Party  in  Long  Beach,   California.  Photo:  AAP/AP   Reform  Par   SAN  FRANCISCO:  Last  week,  Jews  around  the  world  were  taking  stock  of  the  fact  that  there  was  a  Jewish  vice  presidential  candidate  in  the  US.  Well,  now  there  are  two.   At  the  splintered  Reform  Party  con  vention  in  Long  Beach  last  weekend,  Nat  Goldhaber  of  Berkeley  was  select  ed  as  the  running  mate  of  John  Hagelin,  whom  the  party’s  anti-Pat  Buchanan  faction  picked  to  be  its  presidential  candidate.   The  turn  of  events  caught  Goldhaber,  52,  and  his  wife,  Marilyn,  by  surprise.  “I  went  there  to  enjoy  the  convention  and  to  avoid  all  the  dirty  tricks  of  Mr  Buchanan,”  Goldhaber,  a  Reform  Jew,  said.  “Dr  Hagelin  asked  if  I  wanted  to  be  chairman  of  his  cam  paign,  and  I  said  ‘sure’.  Then  he  pre  vailed  on  me  to  put  my  hat  in  the  ring  [as  a  running  mate]  and  1  won  by  a  majority  among  four  candidates.”   Like  Hagelin,  Goldhaber’s  name  has  never  been  heard  by  most  Americans,  even  though  he  is  a  multi-millionaire  and  well-known  in  Silicon  Valley.  In  1987,  he  sold  a  software  company  he  developed,  Tops,  to  Sun  Microsystems  for  a  reported  $US20  million.  Last  week,  he  pocketed  six  percent  of  MyPoints.com,  worth  about  $US27  million  on  paper  when  the  company  completed  a  merger  with  Goldhaber’s  Oakland-based  Cybergold.  He  founded  Cybergold  in  1995,  offering  rewards  to  customers  as  an  incentive  to  respond  to  website  advertisements  and  offers.  He  has   headed  several  other  start-up  compa  nies  as  well,  and  owns  two  planes—a  Cessna  414  and  a  Citation  jet.   “I  lead  a  wonderfully  happy  life,”  Goldhaber  said.  “I  have  enough  money  to  last  a  lifetime.  The  question  is:  What  do  I  do  going  forward?  I’d  like  to  give  things  back  in  a  different   arena.”   Goldhaber  is  a  financial  backer  of   Hagelin,  a  physicist  who  was  the  Natural  Law  Party’s  candidate  in  1992  and  1996.  Although  he  hasn’t  run  for  political  office  since  1964,  when  he  lost  a  bid  for  class  president  of  Oakland’s  College  Preparatory  High  School,  he  is  eager  to  spend  the  next  three  months  campaigning  as  well  as  boning  up  on  the  issues.   “It’s  going  to  take  100  percent  of  my  time  hopefully  for  the  next  eight  years,”  Goldhaber  said,  sounding  like  a  slick  politician.  “Ladies  and  gentle  men,”  he  bellowed  to  the  delegates  at  the  convention,  “it’s  hard  to  believe  this,  but  we  have  a  chance  of  winning  the  White  House  in  November.”   Goldhaber’s  status  as  a  Jewish  can  didate  might  have  received  more  play  in  the  media  had  he  not  been  beaten  to  the  punch  by  Joseph  Lieberman.   “Excellent,”  Goldhaber  said  when  he  heard  about  A1  Gore’s  choice.  “It’s  terrific  that  Jews  are  being  considered  for  positions  in  the  American  political  domain,  but  we’re  still  a  long  way  from  a  Jewish  President.  The  good  thing  is  that  the  US  is  moving  in  the  direction  of  greater  tolerance  in  all   areas.”   The  raucous  Reform  Party  conven  tion  left  the  Buchanan  and  Hagelin  camps  arguing  over  which  candidate   is  the  real  nominee  and  should  receive  $US12.5  million  in  federal  funds.  A  court  ruling  is  expected  next  week,  but  Goldhaber  said  he  and  Hagelin  will  campaign  for  the  White  House  even  if  they  don’t  get  the  funds.   Buchanan,  meanwhile,  hinted  that  Goldhaber  was  chosen  as  Hagelin’s  running  mate  to  bankroll  the  cam  paign.  Eight  years  ago,  Ross  Perot  spent  $US60  million  of  his  own  money  on  his  campaign,  but  Goldhaber  said   contributions  are  limited  for  this  cam   paign  because  the  Reform  Party  is  accepting  federal  funds.  Anyway,  Goldhaber  said  of  his  wealth:  “I’m  not  in  Perot’s  league.”   Goldhaber  and  his  wife  joined   Temple  Sinai  in  Oakland  four  years  ago.  The  couple’s  12-year-old  triplets,  who  attend  a  Jewish  dayschool,  are  10  months  away  from  celebrating  a  triple  batmitzvah.  Before  joining  Sinai,   the  Goldhabers  were  members  at   Congregation  Beth  El  in  Berkeley.  Both  are  Reform  congregations.   Goldhaber  celebrated  his  barmitz  vah  at  Temple  Beth  Abraham  in  Oakland  in  the  1960s.  His  Vienna-born   Goldhaber  and  his  wife  have  triplets  who  attend  a  Jewish  dayschool,  and  they  are  10  months  away  from  celebrating   a  triple  barmitzvah.   mother,  Sulamith,  moved  to  pre-state  Israel  as  a  teenager  and  met  her  German-bom  and  Egypt-raised  hus  band,  Gerson,  when  both  were  attending  Hebrew  University  in  Jerusalem  in  the  1940s.  “Both  sets  of   grandparents  had  the  sense  to  figure  out  what  was  coming  and  get  out  [of  Austria  and  Germany]  in  time,”   Goldhaber  said  of  his  ancestors’  exo  dus  in  the  mid-1930s.  Sulamith  and   Gerson  migrated  to  the  US  to  pursue  Ph.Ds  at  the  University  of  Wisconsin,   she  in  nuclear  chemistry  and  he  in  physics.   “I  was  bom  in  Wisconsin,”  said  Goldhaber,  whose  first  name  is  Amos,  “but  I  was  conceived  in  Jerusalem.”   Sulamith,  who  died  from  cancer  in  1965  at  the  age  of  42,  was  one  of  the  founders  of  Congregation  Beth  Israel,  an  Orthodox  synagogue  in  Berkeley.  Gerson,  76,  is  a  graduate  school  pro  fessor  in  Berkeley.  Goldhaber  is  “not   actively  involved  with  any  Jewish  organisations”,  although  his  wife,  a  Berkeley  graduate  and  epidemiolo  gist,  is  a  lifetime  member  of  Hadassah.  As  for  synagogue,  “we  don’t  go  week  ly,  but  we  do  occasionally”   Goldhaber  has  a  Master’s  in  educa  tion  from  Berkeley.  He  spent  five  years  in  Pennsylvania  state  government  as  an  aide  to  former  Republican  Governor  Dick  Thornburg  and  as  a  state  energy  secretary  after  the  Three   Mile  Island  nuclear  accident.   A  devotee  of  transcendental  medi  tation,  as  is  Hagelin,  Goldhaber  also  holds  a  Bachelor’s  degree  from  Maharishi  University  of  Management  in  Fairfield,  Iowa.  Two  of  his  reasons  for  backing  Hagelin  are  the  candi  date’s  positions  on  finding  renewable  energy  and  agricultural  reform.   Goldhaber  estimated  that  15-20  percent  of  the  Reform  Party’s  old  guard  are  Jewish.  “Jews  are  activists  and  generally  dissatisfied  with  the  sta  tus  quo,”  he  explained,  defining  the  party  as  one  that  has  a  reform-orient  ed  political  agenda  but  no  social  agen  da.  “Ross  Perot’s  vision  of  the  Reform  Party  was  good:  let’s  see  whether  we  can  bring  sound  and  honest  solutions  to  problems  that  beset  our  country  and  international  relations.  We  are  not  beholden  to  the  same  gods  that  are  worshipped  in  our  Congress  —  the  gods  of  money  and  special-interest  groups.”   Goldhaber  said  Hagelin  is  “a  big  supporter  of  Israel”,  as  well  as  “a  sup  porter  of  applying  scientific  innova  tion  to  the  solution  of  very  real  prob  lems,  which  is  a  Jewish  outlook”.

"  TELLING  TALES   DONNA  JACOBS  SIFE   I  HAVE  just  returned  from  a  tour  in  Tasmania.  For  two  weeks,  I  travelled  the  state  in  my  little  rented  car,  presenting  up  to  three  performances  a  day  at  different   schools.   Usually,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  I  was  exhausted  and  booked  myself  a  room  at  the  local  pub  (in  small  towns,  the  pub  is  usually  very  quaint,  cheap  and  the  coolest  place  to  stay),  had  a  meal  quietly  somewhere,  went  to  bed  and  waited  till  dark.   It  was  largely  an  exercise  in  hard  work  and  solitude,  and  an  opportunity  to  observe  a  part  of  Australia  I  hitherto  knew  nothing   about.   Initially,  I  was  struck  by  how  very  mono-  cultural  Tasmania  is.  I  am  not  accustomed  to  telling  stories  to  a  sea  of  white  Anglo-Saxon  faces.  In  New  South  Wales,  multiculturalism  is  so  much  a  part  of  the  demography,  I  was  quite  taken  aback  by  the  absence  of  mixed  colour  and  culture  in  Tassie.    It  still  feels  quite  colonial,  in  an  eerie  sort  of  way.   My  program  had  certain  clear  themes.  Freedom  and  oppression,  self-worth,  cele-  brating  the  human  spirit,  racism.  One  story  I   Slaves  we  were.  Slaves  we  still  are.   Of  prejudice,  of  fear,  of  greed.   tell  is  from  the  Holocaust.  It  is  a  true  story  of  a  miraculous  escape.  I  tell  them  I  am  Jewish.   “Hands  up  if  you  know  what  a  Jew  is,”  I  would  ask.  I  would  see  a  few  hands  every  now  and  again.   And  more  shocking  than  that,  I  asked  every  high  school  I  was  at:  “Hands  up  if  you  know  what  the  Holocaust  is.”  Not  once,  not  even  in  the  church  schools,  did  a  hand  rise  up  in  response.  Some  teachers  were  shocked,  one  or  two  were  deeply  embar-  rassed.  “Perhaps  it  is  semantics,”  I  tried  to  reassure  them;  “perhaps  they  know  of  it  by  a   different  term.”   I  did  a  lot  of  walking.  In  gorges,  up  moun-  tains,  along  rivers.  It  is  very  beautiful,  but  nowhere  was  a  there  a  hint  of  any  previous  indigenous  presence.  Very  few  Aboriginal   place  names,  no  mention  of  who  was  there  before  us,  how  they  had  lived,  what  had  hap-  pened  to  them.  I  asked  the  kids:  “Do  you  know  what  happened  to  the  Aboriginal  peo-  ple  in  Tasmania?”  They  did  not  know  that  Tasmania  had  virtually  wiped  out  all  the  indigenous  people  by  1900.  I  couldn’t  help  but  wonder  if  it  was  shame  that  motivated   such  silence.   One  day,  1  travelled  to  a  little  town  called  Oatlands  and  popped  into  the  local  tourist  centre.  There,  I  struck  up  a  conversation  with  a  local  farmer,  who  was  an  avid  histori-  an  of  the  area.  I  told  him  what  I  did  for  a  liv-  ing,  and  what  I  had  observed  in  my  travels.  He  was  deeply  moved,  almost  to  tears.  He  spoke  with  great  emotion  and  authority  about  the  history  of  the  Aboriginal  people  in  the  Oatlands  area,  and  promised  to  make   copies  of  a  journal  written  by  a  missionary  in  the  late  1800s  by  the  name  of  Robinson.  He  thought  I  might  find  the  information  interesting.   One  part  of  the  journal  describes  the  abduction  of  the  Aboriginal  women  by  the  local  sealers.  The  men  from  the  tribe  go  to  retrieve  their  women,  only  to  be  shot  and  killed.  Let  me  quote  to  you  one  small  extract  of  that  journal:   This  information  was  the  occasion  of  gener-  al  lamentation  and  there  was  not  one  Aborigine  but  wept  bitterly.  My  feelings  was  overcome.  I  could  not  suppress  them:  the  involuntary  lachryme  burst  forth  and  /  sor-  rowed  for  them.  Poor  unbefriended  and  hap-  less  people!  I  imagined  myself  an  Aborigine.  I  looked  upon  them  as  brethen,  not  as  they  had   been  maligned,  savages.  No,  they  are  my  brethren  by  creation  ...  They  have  been  repre-  sented  as  only  a  link  between  the  human  and  brute  species,  and  nothing  more  false  could  proceed  from  the  lips  of  men  —  they  are  equal,  if  not  superior,  to  ourselves.   In  my  program  to  the  schools,  I  sing  a  song  of  a  true  story  of  a  young  white  girl  who  is  told  never  to  go  near  the  “camp  of  the  black  fella”.  One  night,  her  mother’s  gown  catches  light  and  she  goes  up  in  flames.  She  is  in  des-  perate  need  of  help,  but  the  little  girl  cannot  forget  her  mother’s  tales  of  “the  devil  drum  and  the  evil  eye”.  In  her  fear,  she  waits  until  morning.  Her  mother  dies.  I  introduce  the  song  with  that  extract  of  Mr  Robinson’s  jour   nal.   I  am  overwhelmed  with  the  cruel  disre-  gard  which  Senator  John  Herron  and  our  Prime  Minister  have  displayed  over  the  issue  of  the  Stolen  Generation.  I  wonder  if   they  had  the  capacity  to  “imagine  them  selves  as  an  Aborigine”,  as  did  the  wonderful  Mr  Robinson,  they  would  be  so  cavalier  in  their  dispensing  of  the  issue  of  a  Stolen   Generation.   I  have  been  reading  the  Book  of  Exodus.  In  Exodus  3:3,  Moses  stands  at  the  Burning  Bush,  “and  Moses  said:  ‘I  will  turn  aside  and  see  this  great  sight,  why  the  Bush  is  not  burnt’.”  The  language  is  strange  here,  espe-  cially  the  word  for  “turn  aside”.  Why  would  Moses  turn  aside  when  he  is  granted  this  vision?  The  Rashi  reads:  asura  mikan  I’hitkarev  sham  —  To  go  away  from  here  and   go  over  there.   Surely  this  is  what  is  required  of  us.  Slaves  we  were.  Slaves  we  still  are.  Of  prejudice,  of  fear,  of  greed.  I  want  to  get  up  from  where  I  stand,  and  move  to  somewhere  else.  Closer  to  where  you  stand.  I  want  to  step  into  your  suffering,  your  fears,  your  losses  and  feel  them  as  if  they  are  my  own.  The  seder  requires  that  we  understand  that  it  is  not  our  ancestors  who  were  slaves,  but  us.  So  that  we  can  “turn  aside”  from  our  own  posi-  tion  and  step  into  another  one.  So  that  we  can  “remember”  the  hunger,  the  deprivation,  the  oppression  that  we  suffered  for  400   years.   Because  if  we  can  remember  it,  then  we   can  know  it  in  another.   “Oh,  may  all,  created  in  Thine  image,  recognise  that  they  are  brethren,  so  that,  one  in  spirit,  and  one  in  fellowship,  they  may  be  forever  united  before  Thee.  Then  shall  Thy  Kingdom  be  established  on  earth.”   ■  Donna  Jacobs  Sife  is  a  Sydney  storyteller. ",2000-04-14
"  Celebrating  Jewish  birth   Title:  A  Time  to  be  Born:   Customs  and  Folklore  of  Jewish  Birth   Author:  Michele  Klein   Publisher:  Jewish  Publication   Society,  300pp,  $59.95  (hardcover^   Reviewer:  Gael  Hammer   THIS  must  be  just  about  the  per   fect  gift  for  thinking  people  expecting  a  baby.  Michele  Klein  and  her  neighbour  had  both  just  had  their  third  babies  and  were  lamenting  the  lack  of  literature  on  the  emotions  surrounding  the  birth  of  a  child.  While  there  was  plenty  of  medical  material  and  information  on  the  Jewish  laws  concerning  birth,  there  was  nothing  about  the  mysti  cal  experiences  aroused  by  the  dis  covery  of  having  conceived,  feeling  the  first  kick,  or  holding  the  baby  for   the  first  time.   A  celebration  of  the  birth  of  Jewish  babies,  A  Time  to  be  Bom  is  an  in  depth  exploration  of  the  emotions,  beliefs,  customs  and  traditions  of  childbirth  amongst  Jews.  In  1984,  200  people  in  Israel  were  interviewed  about  folk  traditions  and  birth-relat  ed  customs  from  old  Diaspora  com   munities.  Klein  also  researched  hun   dreds  of  sources,  some  extremely  obscure,  from  the  Bible  and  Talmud  to  prayers,  Kabbalah,  books  of  min  hagim  (customs),  midwifery  hand  books,  remedy  and  record  books,  personal  diaries  and  memoirs.  It  would  be  impossible  to  imagine  a  more  comprehensive  collection  of  source  material  on  the  subject.   Indeed,  how  the  author  found  them  must  be  a  story  in  itself.   The  result  is  enchanting  and  capti  vating.  The  book  is  organised  into  the  four  principal  phases  of  child  bearing:  conception,  pregnancy,  birth  and  the  post-natal  period.  Were  you  aware  that  the  traditional  motifs  of  pomegranates,  wheat-sheaves,  fish  and  birds,  frequently  seen  on  old  ketubot  (marriage  contracts),  wed  ding  invitations  and  benchers  (grace  after  meal  cards),  were  fertility  sym  bols?  A  13th  century  marriage  manu  al  attributed  to  Nahmanides  advises  that  if  a  wife  reaches  a  climax  first,  a  son  is  likely  to  be  conceived.  There  is  a  fascinating  chapter  on  barrenness,  followed  by  a  woodcut  illustration  from  the  Venice  Haggadah  of  1609  on  how  to  avoid  conception  —  sleep  in  separate  beds!   Klein  uncovers  ancient  methods  of  contraception  and  abortion  as  well  as  discussing  20th  century  issues.  She  notes  that  celebrating  pregnancy  has  never  been  part  of  Ashkenazi  ritual.  Indeed,  the  evil  eye  had  to  be  confused  so  as  not  to  attract  catastrophe.  In  Istanbul,  how  ever,  a  lavish  tea  served  on  the  best  china  and  linen  from  the  dowry  were  given  in  the  fifth  month  of  a  first  pregnancy.  The  tablecloth  was  then  cut  by  a  married  woman  with  living  parents  —  a  good  omen  for  the  new  mother  —  and  the  mother-to-be  threw  sugared  almonds  on  the  cloth  to  symbolise  her  child’s  sweet  future,  after  which  it  was  made  up  into  a  layette.  Klein  also  discovered  some  fascinating  folk  methods  for   predicting  the  sex  of  an  unborn  child,  none  of  which  ultimately   appear  too  reliable!   There  is  a  chapter  on  pregnancy  loss  and  another  on  death  in  child  birth.  As  for  the  birth  process  itself,  midwives  have  made  extensive  use  of  massaging  oils,  warm  baths  and  hot  compresses  since  ancient  times.  Were  you  aware  that  babies  were  delivered  by  caesarean  section  only  when  the  mother  had  died?  Even  the  great  physician  Maimonides  acknowledged  that  there  was  no  chance  of  her  surviving  such  an  operation.  Practices  of  the  first  week  after  birth,  including  lying-in,  nurs  ing,  wet-nurses  and  care  of  the  moth  er,  are  discussed,  while  extensive  newborn-welcoming  ceremonies,  blessings  and  lullabies  are  given.   The  scope  of  this  attractive  book  may  be  encyclopaedic,  but  it  is  accessible  and  easy-to-read.  Even  the  reference  pages  are  well  thought  out,  and  footnotes  can  be  easily  found.  A  mini-biography  is  provided  for  each  historical  personality  men  tioned  in  the  text,  while  the  bibliog  raphy  is  divided  into  sub-topics,  such  as  Charms  and  Medicine,  Folktales  and  Poetry  Collections.  There  is  also  an  index  of  Biblical  and  Talmudic  references.   Unique  in  its  scope,  A  Time  to  be  Bom  is  set  to  become  a  classic.  What  better  way  to  prepare  both  mentally  and  emotionally  for  a  happy  event?

"  About  600  people  turned  out  at  Home  nightclub  to  raise  funds  for  Young  UlA's  project  at  Ramat   Hadassah  Youth  Village,  which  caters  for  Israeli  youth  from  disadvantaged  backgrounds.  Lisa  and  Debra  Segal,  Sylvia  Malki  and  Daniel  Vasin  were  among  the  guests.   H  Pictures,  page  24   Anglican  leader  active  in  Jewish-Christian  relations   THE  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  has  welcomed  the  election  of  the  Most  Rev  Dr  Peter  Camley  as  Anglican  Primate  of  Australia  as  a  man  committed  to  the  promotion  of  inter  faith  relations.   The  Jewish  community  was  strongly  repre  sented  at  the  installation  of  the  Primate,  which  went  ahead  despite  threats  by  some  church  leaders  to  boycott  it.   Central  Synagogue  Rabbi  Selwyn  Franklin,  who  is  president  of  the  Orthodox  Rabbis  of  Australasia,  Emeritus  Rabbi  Dr  John  Levi  of  Melbourne’s  Temple  Beth  El  and  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  president  Henry  Mendelson  all  attended,  as  did  NSW  Governor  Gordon  Samuel.  Lessons  were  read  by  retired  Governor-General  Sir  Zelman  Cowan.   Mr  Mendelson  welcomed  the  Primate’s  appointment  as  a  positive  step  in  the  relation  ship  between  the  Anglican  Church  and  the  Jewish  community  (the  Sydney  Synod  is  one  of  the  Council’s  sponsoring  bodies).   The  Church  had  elected  a  man  well  known  for  his  ecumenical  strengths,  as  well  as  his  sensitivities  to  the  need  to  consolidate  the  beginnings  of  the  dialogue  between  the  two  denominations,  he  said.   “It  is  a  matter  of  record  that  Dr  Carnley  was  instrumental  in  assisting  the  establishment  of  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  in  Western  Australia  and  has  frequently  been  a  leading  force  in  establishing  interfaith  dialogue”,  Mr   Mendelson  added.   During  his  installation  address,  the  Most  Rev  Carnley  made  several  references  to  the  need  for  the  Anglican  Church  to  broaden  its  vision.  “Without  a  global  revolution  in  the  sphere  of  human  consciousness,  nothing  will  change  for  the  better”,  he  declared.   The  Anglican  Synod  went  out  of  its  way  to  demonstrate  its  awareness  of  the  need  to  recognise  the  wider  community  with  the  wel  coming  sounds  of  the  didgeridoo  and  an  address  by  a  member  of  the  Iora  people,  on  whose  land  the  cathedral  stands.  Four  school  students  from  families  who  come  from  over  seas  read  prayers  in  their  own  languages.   The  Most  Rev  Carnley  said  the  Church  has  lost  touch  with  vast  numbers  of  its  members.  “At  the  same  time,  in  the  context  of  the  tragic  brokenness  of  the  present  world,  we  also  have  responsibilities  to  foster  dialogue  with  other  faiths,”  he  said.

"  “Support  Jewish  Studies”  plea   AT  THE  BOARD   STEFAN   BIALOGUSKI   THE  community  has  been  strongly  urged  to  support  tertiary  Jewish  Studies  courses  by  endowing  lectureships  at  Sydney’s  universi   ties.   Hakoah  Senior  Lecturer  in  Jewish  Studies  and  Political  Science  at  the  University  of  NSW  Dr  Geoffrey  Brahm  Levey,  head  of  Semitic  Studies  at  the  University  of  Sydney  Dr  Suzanne  Rutland,  and  Professor  Clive  Kessler  of  the  University  of  NSW  School  of  Sociology  have  all  spoken  out  on  the  need  for  Jewish  courses  at  Sydney’s  universities   Professor  Kessler  told  the  NSW  Jewish   Professor  Clive  Kessler   ooara  or   Deputies  plenum  that  the  challenge  of  Jewish  tertiary  education  had  yet  to  be  ade  q  u  a  t  e  1  y  addressed  by  the  community.   “There  is  no  mature  Jewish  community  in  the  world  which  has  not  made  Jewish  Studies  an  integral  part  of  the  academic  curriculum,  and  of  the  world  of   modern  liberal   scholarship  generally,  in  the  universities  of  its  city  and  region,”  he  said.  “We  have  perhaps  been  successful  short-term  improvisers,  but  we  have  yet  to  securely  establish  a  longer  term  programmatic  and  institutional  frame  work.  Our  community  will  have  to  find  ways  of  supporting  Jewish  Studies  programs  by  endowing  positions  in  the  universities.”   Jewish  Studies  not  only  helps  continuity  and  ethnic  survival,  but  allows  the  training  of  local  people  as  dayschool  Jewish  Studies  teachers.  This  point  was  taken  up  by  Dr  Rutland,  who  said  the  community  had  suf  fered  from  relying  on  attracting  people  from  abroad.  “Until  recently,  we  failed  to  recognise  that  if  you  don’t  have  quality  teachers,  you  don’t  have  quality  Jewish  education.”   Dr  Levey  said  there  was  a  shortage  of  Jewish  Studies  teachers  worldwide,  and  sen  ior  staff  could  command  impressive  salaries.  However,  while  the  UNSW  Jewish  Studies  pro  gram  was  thriving,  the  future  was  uncertain,  given  the  looming  retirement  of  Jewish  educa  tors  and  government  funding  cuts.   Professor  Kessler  noted  that  Jewish  Studies   also  had  an  “important  role  of  cultural  out  reach  —  reforming  and  informing  in  a  positive  educational  context  the  attitudes  and  opin   ions  of  non-Jews  towards  us”.   Fighting  violence   WOMEN  in  Israel  are  not  exempt  from  the  worldwide  problem  of  domestic  violence,  and  Wizo  is  playing  its  part  in  helping  the  victims.   Wizo  NSW   president   Esther  Wakerman  reminded  the  community  of  her  organisa   tion’s  role  in  protecting  Israeli  women   in  her  report  back  from  the  World  Wizo  Conference,  which  attract  ed  1000  mem  bers  from  around  the  world.   The  2C  Australian  dele  gates  visited  Wizo  projects  ir  Israel,  including   a  school  for  dis  turbed  children  in  Haifa.  Wizc  also  runs  shel  ters  and  othei  services  foi  women  trying  tc  escape  violent  partners.

The  need  to  expand  services  is  so  great  that  Wizo  recently  sent  leaflets  to  thousands  of  its  members  across  NSW,  seek  ing  support.   AN  update  on  the  struggle  for  Holocaust  and  related  restitution  was  given  by  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  convener  of  resti   tution  issues  Diane  Shteinman.   The  International  Commission  on  Holocaust  Era  Insurance  Claims  was  encour  aging  all  Jews  who  lived  in  pre-war  Europe,  or  who  had  parents  or  grandparents  there,  to  request  an  application  form,  she  said.  To  obtain  a  form,  telephone  1800  706  922.   A  universal  application  process  for  claims  against  the  $US5  billion  slave  labour  fund   being  finalised  by  the  German  Government,  German  business  and  other  governments,  should  be  established  by  October.  The  appli  cation  process  will  be  conducted  for  Jewish  former  slave  labourers  by  the  Conference  on  Jewish  Material  Claims  Against  Germany.   The  British  Bankers  Association  had  pub  lished  a  list  of  13,000  dormant  accounts  which  had  been  frozen  under  a  law  passed  in  1939.  The  list  can  be  accessed  on  the  internet  at  www.restoreuk.org.uk   Access  to  the  channels  of  restitution  is  open  to  all,  so  taking  on  a  lawyer  would  not  speed  up  the  process,  Ms  Shteinman  said.  However,  she  welcomed  the  announcement  that  the  NSW  Society  of  Jewish  Jurists  and  Lawyers  was  helping  people  to  complete  forms  at  no  charge.

He  noted  that  young  people  are  becoming  involved  in  the  commemorations,  adding  that  his  committee  is  keen  to  hear  any  criticisms  before  planning  next  year’s  activi  ties  (fax  9331  4712,  email  bodnsw@tmx.com  .au)   ■  Uncle  Chatzkel  will  be  screened  at  the  State  Parliament  theatrette  on  June  21.   Iranian  13  strategy   CALLING  for  a  fair  trial  for  the  13  Jews  facing  espionage  charges  in  Iran  is  laudable  but  use  less,  Board  president  Peter  Wertheim  said.  “Calling  for  economic  sanctions  is  perhaps  the  only  thing  that  can  make  an  impact.”   School  funding   THE  tendency  of  Jews  to  live  close  together  is  one  of  the  reasons  that  the  dayschools  have  been  hard  hit  by  changes  in  government  fund  ing.   Board  secretary  Stephen  Rothman  said  the  Commonwealth  bases  its  funding  of  private  schools  on  the  average  income  of  the  area  in  which  the  school  lies.  “That’s  fine  if  you  have  a  statistically  average  school.  The  problem  is  that  with  schools  like  Yeshiva,  we  have  large  families  on  low  incomes  in  areas  that  would  normally  have  high  incomes.”   So  while  dayschools  do  not  see  as  much  of  the  benefit  of  federal  funding  increases  to  pri  vate  schools  as  others  do,  those  which  receive  state  funding  have  to  cope  with  the  NSW  Government  decision  to  cut  funding  —  a  political  decision  made  in  response  to  the  Federal  Government’s  cutting  of  funding  to  public  schools  on  a  per  capita  basis.

"  Senate  urdge  to  ignore""immoral""  Jewish  submissions   A  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  member  who  Lodged  complaints  with  the  Sydney  Beth  Din  in  connection  with  Jewish  gays  and  the  Sydney  Mardi  Gras  has  urged  a  federal  parliamentary  committee  to  ignore  “immoral”  submissions  from  Jews  or  Jewish  organisations.   Dr  Eliana  Freydel  Miller  has  told  the  Senate  Legal  and  Constitutional  and  References  Committee  in  a  written  submission  that  the  Anti-Genocide  Bill  1999,  which  was  presented  recently  in  Federal  Parliament,  ignores  the  basic  concepts  of  morality  by  extending  the  crime  of  genocide  to  cover  groups  defined  by  their  gen  der,  sexuality,  political  affiliations  or  disability.   She  claims  that  her  submission,  which  is  accompanied  by  a  letter  signed  by  Rabbi  Chaim  Ingram,  Associate  Rabbi  of  Central  Synagogue,  has  rabbinical  endorsement  and  “constitutes  authoritatively  authentic  Jewish  responses”  to   the  Bill.   In  a  preamble  to  her  submission,  she  says:  “Any  submission  which  counters  or  conflicts  with  both  the  ethical  and  moral  alignment  of  this  submission  and  its  inextricable  binding  to  the  teaching  of  the  Seven  Noahide  Laws  for  all  humanity  and  to  authentic  Torah  teaching  both  given  by  God  at  Mount  Sinai  by  any  group  or  individual  claiming  to  be  Jewish,  whether  offi  cially  Jewish  or  not  officially  Jewish,  or  simply  calling  itself  Jewish,  cannot  be  considered  or  recognised  as  an  authentic  Jewish  response  to  the  Anti-Genocide  Bill  1999  and  should  be  disre  garded”   Rabbi  Ingram’s  letter  commends  and  endors  es  Dr  Miller’s  submission  “as  an  authentic   Jewish  response”  to  the  Bill,  saying:  “The  sub  mission  is  founded  upon,  the  principles,  ethics  arid  moral  values  of  the  Torah,  which  is  the  basis  of  Jewish  civilisation.”   But  Rabbi  Ingram  this  week  distanced  himself  from  Dr  Miller’s  preamble,  emphasising  to  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  his  endorsement   Ellana  Freydel  Miller   Rabbi  Chaim  Ingram   was  personal  and  should  not  be  connected  with  the  Central  Synagogue  or  the  NSW  Rabbinical  Council,  of  which  he  is  honorary  secretary.   He  told  the  AJN  in  a  letter:  “My  endorsement   “It  is  a  perversion  of  the  courts  of  the  land...  to  entrench  in  law  any   legislation  which  goes  against  the  laws  given  by  God.”   does  not  imply  that  I,  had  I  made  the  submis  sion,  would  have  approached  the  task  identical  ly.  My  endorsement  relates  to  the  content  and  does  not  relate  to  Dr  Miller’s  idiosyncratic  style  ...  Analogous  in  a  sense  is  a  rabbi’s  endorsement  of  sticky  sweets  as  strictly  kosher,  which  does   not  necessarily  carry  the  implication  that  he  recommends  the  consumption  of  sticky   sweets”   Earlier,  Rabbi  Ingram  told  the  AJN  in  a  tele   phone  interview:  “I  can’t  endorse  [the  pream  ble]  because  I  haven’t  seen  any  other  submis  sion.  I  think  it  would  be  better  if  you  left  my  name  out  of  it  altogether,  but  if  you  do  mention  me,  make  it  clear  that  I  don’t  endorse  that  pre   amble.   “I  am  not  her  mentor,  and  my  approval  of  her  submission  does  not  mean  I  agree  with  any  other  actions  she  may  have  been  involved  in.”   In  her  submission,  Dr  Miller  says  Australia  should  not  join  with  any  states,  national  or  inter  national  treaties,  tribunals,  conventions,  courts,  individuals  or  the  United  Nations  if  they  in  any  way  breach  the  teaching  of  the  Seven  Noahide  Laws.  Listing  the  Seven  Noahide  Laws,  which  include  a  prohibition  of  immorality,  including  incest,  adultery,  homosexuality  and  bestiality,  Dr  Miller  declares:  “It  is  a  perversion  of  the  courts  of  the  land  ...  to  entrench  in  law  any  leg  islation  which  goes  against  the  laws  given  by   God"".   She  says  Australia  must  have  anti-genocide  legislation  to  allow  for  extradition  of  those  accused  of  war  crimes,  but  she  attacks  the  Bill,  drafted  by  Australian  Democrats  Senator  Brian  Greig,  saying  it  “threatens  justice,  morality  and  the  freedom  to  teach  morality"".  She  says  it  is  “a  monumental  perversion  of  the  courts  of  the  land  and  misleading”  because,  by  including  a  group  of  people  based  on  their  sexuality,  it  entrenches  in  law  a  restriction  on  the  teaching  of  morality.   Teachers  of  morality  would  be  considered  to  have  committed  genocide,  attracting  a  penalty  of  up  to  10  years’  imprisonment  or  life  impris  onment,  Dr  Miller  said.   The  submission  of  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  addresses  the  extension  of  genocide  to  cover  gender,  sexuality,  political  affiliations  and  disability  indirectly.  It  says  the  aims  of  the  Genocide  Convention  “are  not  fur  thered  by  enumerating  particular  populations  which  may  be  the  subject  of  genocide”.  The  B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commission  says  the  provisions  of  the  proposed  Bill  are  “appro  priate”  and  submits  that  it  should  be  enacted  “in  its  current  form”.   The  Senate  committee  is  due  to  hear  submis  sions  in  Sydney  and  Melbourne  next  month. ",2000-04-14
"  Camolic-Jewish  dialogue   threatened  by  “deficient”  remark   ROME:  Decades  of  hard  work  spent  developing   positive  Catholic-Jewish  relations  have  been  threatened  by  a  Vatican  document  which  dis  misses  other  religions  as  “gravely  deficient”.   The  publication  of  the  statement  Dominus  Jesus  (Lord  Jesus)  closely  followed  the  beatifica  tion  of  Pope  Pius  IX.  The  19th-century  pontiff  was  the  last  Pope  to  keep  Jews  in  a  ghetto,  and  he  was  behind  the  1858  kidnapping  of  a  young  Jewish  boy  who  had  been  secretly  baptised  as  a  baby.   Issued  by  the  Congregation  ror  the  Doctrine  of  the  Faith  —  the  Vatican’s  guardian  of  orthodoxy  —  the  document  said  that  followers  of  other  reli  gions  were  “in  a  gravely  deficient  situation  in  comparison  with  those  who,  in  the  Church,  have  the  fullness  of  the  means  of  salvation”.   According  to  the  Vatican  document,  even  other  Christian  denominations  have  “defects”.  “There  exists  a  single  Church  of  Christ,  which  subsists  in  the  Catholic  Church,  governed  by  the  Successor  of  Peter  and  by  the  bishops  in  com  munion  with  him,”  it  said.   The  moves  prompted  Rome  Chief  Rabbi  Elio  Toaff  and  his  deputy,  Rabbi  Abramo  Piattelli,  to  withdraw  from  last  week’s  scheduled  “Day  of  Jewish-Christian  Dialogue”  symposium,  which  had  been  part  of  the  Holy  See’s  Millennium  Holy  Year  program.   In  Sydney,  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  national  vice-president  Jeremy  Jones  Apple  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News:  “Given  the  sensitivity  over  the  centuries  of  Jewish-Christian  relations,  there’s  no  such  thing  as  a  ripple;  every   incident  causes  a  wave.  The  question  is  whether  we  can  ride  out  this  wave.”   Added  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews   past  president  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple:  “Even  if  the  Catholic  Church  believes  it  is  the  only  true  religion,  does  this  mean  that  nobody  else...  has  a  right  to  their  own  conscience  and  convictions?  How  can  the  Catholic  Church  be  so  certain  that  theirs  is  the  only  faith  that  God  listens  to?  Until  these  and  other  issues  are  sorted  out,  inter-reli  gious  dialogue  can  hardly  proceed.”   Like  many  international  observers,  Rabbi  Apple  found  the  document  out  of  step  with  the  outreach  to  Jews  and  other  faiths  that  has  been  a  pillar  of  the  papacy  of  Pope  John  Paul  D.   The  Pope  made  self-examination  and  repen  tance  for  past  sins  —  including  antisemitism  —  a  major  theme  of  the  2000  Jubilee,  or  Holy  Year.  This  culminated  with  the  Pope  praying  at  the  Western  Wall  during  a  pilgrimage  to  Israel  in  March  this  year.   The  new  “pronouncements  of  the  Church  are  surprising  and  inconsistent  with  the  courageous  steps  of  John  Paul  D”,  Rome  Jewish  community  president  Leone  Paserman  said.   And  Cardinal  Edward  Cassidy,  the  Australian  who  heads  the  Vatican  Council  for  Christian  Unity,  which  is  responsible  for  relations  with  Jews,  has  made  a  rare  public  criticism  of  a  col  league  on  the  matter.   The  Sydney  Morning  Herald  reported  that  he  had  criticised  the  head  of  the  Congregation  for  the  Doctrine  of  the  Faith,  Germany’s  Cardinal   Joseph  Ratzinger,  for  issuing  a  document  mistak  en  in  “tone  and  timing”.  “The  same  things  could  have  been  said  differently,”  he  was  quoted  as  say  ing.   Rabbi  Apple,  who  participated  in  a  historic  dis  cussion  of  Jewish-Catholic  relations  in  Sydney  a  year  ago  with  Cardinal  Cassidy,  added:  “It  is  extremely  strange,  and  one  wonders  who  pro  duced  this  document  and  to  what  extent  it  is  offi  cial  policy  and  whether  the  Pope  himself  aproved  it  or  even  knows  of  it.  Vatican  bureau  cracy  being  what  it  is,  these  are  questions  that   need  to  be  sorted  out.   “I  believe  that  many  in  the  Catholic  communi  ty  will  be  asking  similar  questions.  No  wonder  that  Cardinal  Cassidy  has  criticised  it  as  insensi   tive  and  unwise.”   Mr  Jones:  “The  statement  shows  that  the  last  three  decades  of  improving  relations  have  meant  very  little  to  some  important  people  within  the  Vatican.  That’s  why  Cardinal  Cassidy’s  public  rejection  of  it  is  so  important.”   Tullia  Zevi,  a  former  president  of  the  Italy’s  Jewish  community,  described  the  developments  as  “a  cold  shower  after  the  optimism  generated  by  the  development  of  dialogue”.   Jews  were  not  the  only  voices  of  protest  against  the  Vatican  document.  “The  idea  that  Anglican  and  other  churches  are  not  ‘proper  churches’  seems  to  question  the  considerable  ecumenical  gains  we  have  made,”  Archbishop  of  Canterbury  George  Carey  —  the  spiritual  leader  of  70  million  Anglicans  —  commented.   Rabbi  Raymond  Apple...  “How  can  the  Catholic  Church  be  so  certain  that  theirs  Is  the  only  faith  that  God  listens  to?  Until  these  and  other  issues  are  sorted  out,  dialogue  can  hardly  proceed.”   Some  saw  the  developments  as  dramatic  evi  dence  of  an  inner  struggle  within  the  Vatican  hier  archy  as  80-year-old  John  Paul’s  reign  draws  to   its  inevitable  close.   But  others  saw  them  as  consistent  with  Catholic  theology  and  belief.  “It  is  the  Roman  Catholic  formula  of  confession,  extended  to  behaviour,”  said  a  Rome  observer.  “The  assump  tion  is  that  you  apologise,  ask  forgiveness  and  the  slate  is  wiped  clean.”   But  Mr  Jones  said:  “There  will  be  a  lot  of  peo  ple  trying  very  hard  to  make  sure  we  can  ride  out  this  wave.  But  it’s  going  to  be  very  hard.”   JTA,  AJN ",2000-10-06
"  PARTISAN   SAMUPSK1   THE  contest  between  the  Democrat  A1  Gore  and  the  Republican  George  W  Bush  for  winning  over  American  Jewish  voters  on  “Jewish”  issues  seems  very  one-sided.  Gore-sided.   Gore  starts  with  the  built-in  advan  tage  that,  as  noted  here  last  week,  the  Democrats  have  won  80  percent  of  the  Jewish  votes  in  the  last  two  presi  dential  elections.  Moreover,  Gore  is  a  nationally  known  candidate  —  Vice  President  for  the  last  eight  years  and  a  prominent  senator  before  that  —  run  ning  on  his  pro-Israel  record  and  his  line  on  health  programs,  education,  gun  control  and  women’s  rights  on  abortion  which  appeals  to  many  American  Jews,  many  of  them  liberal   Democrats.   Bush,  by  contrast,  comes  from  Texas  where  there  are  few  Jewish  vot  ers,  and  he’s  new  to  national  politics  and  foreign  policy.  And  his  positions  on  the  major  domestic  issues  that  count  for  many  Jews  are  either  too  blurred  or  too  conservative,  at  least  for  most  Jewish  voters.   Part  of  Bush’s  problem  is  the  other  George  Bush.  Jews  have  long  memo  ries  politically.  So,  to  some  degree,  Bush  Jnr  is  paying  for  the  sins  of  Bush  Snr,  the  former  President.  If  Bush  Jnr  is   to  have  any  chance  of  keeping  even  the  20  percent  of  Jewish  voters  who  chose  the  Republican  Bob  Dole  over  the  Democrat  Bill  Clinton  (and  VP  Gore)  at  the  1996  presidential  elec  tions,  let  alone  doing  better,  he  has  to  face  up  to  the  lingering  Bush  snr  clouds  and  somehow  dispel  them.   The  irony  is  that  in  1988,  when  Bush  Snr  defeated  George  Dukakis,  he  cap  tured  30  percent  of  Jewish  votes,  won  more  Jewish  support  through  1990  as  he  benefitted  from  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  beginnings  of  Exodus  11,  and  went  on  to  widespread  Jewish  acclaim  early  in  1991  after  forc  ing  Saddam  Hussein  out  of  Iraq.  If  Bush  had  been  able  to  stand  for  re  election  at  any  time  in  1991  until  September,  he  would  have  won  in  a  landslide  and,  according  to  some  esti  mates,  he  would  have  bettered  the  record  40  percent  of  Jews  who  voted  for  Republican  Dwight  Eisenhower  in  1956.   So  what  went  wrong?  The  answer  tells  us  a  good  deal  about  Bush  Jnr’s  current  problem.  As  journalist  J  J  Goldberg  explains  in  his  book  Jewish  Power  (Addison  -Wesley,  1996),  President  Bush  addressed  a  press  conference  on  September  12,1991,  to  explain  why  he  wanted  to  delay  Israel’s  request  for  loan  guarantees  of  $US10  billion  to  help  integrate  the  Soviet  Jews  then  arriving  in  their  hun  dreds  of  thousands.  That  day,  some  1300  Jewish  leaders  from  all  over  the  United  States  had  gathered  in  Washington  to  lobby  their  elected  rep  resentatives  in  the  Congress  to  pro  vide  the  loan  guarantees  urgently.   Bush  had  a  case  for  delay,  but  it  was  the  language  he  used  about  the  Jewish  lobby  that  proved  his  undoing.  Arguing  that  he  was  “up  against  some  powerful  political  forces”,  he  contin  ued:  “I  heard  today  there  were  some  thing  like  a  thousand  lobbyists  on  the   (Capitol)  Hill  working  the  other  side  of  the  question...”  And  in  an  angry  tone  he  added:  “We’ve  got  one  lonely  little  guy  down  here  doing  it.”   As  Goldberg  concludes,  the  idea  of   “a  lonely  little  guy”  in  the  White  House,  who  just  happened  to  be  the  most  powerful  leader  in  the  world,  being  thwarted  by  “powerful  political  forces”  who  just  happened  to  be  a  mix  of  UJA  presidents,  lawyers,  school  teachers,  rabbis  and  Hadassah   If  Bush  Jnr  could  win  back  half  of  the  Jewish  voters  who  voted  for  Bush  Snr,  it  could  be  enough  to  capture  a  state   such  as  New  York  or  California  or  even  both  -  and  the   White  House.   women,  was  both  ludicrous  and  dis  turbing.  What  really  upset  the  Jewish  leaders  was  the  way  Bush  had  sug  gested  that  by  exercising  their  demo  cratic  rights  as  citizens,  American   Jews  were  behaving  unacceptably.   It  was  a  turning-point  for  Bush.  At  the  1992  November  elections  he  could  manage  only  12  percent  of  Jewish  votes;  even  the  wild-card  third  candi  date  Ross  Perot  won  8  per  cent.  The  rest  went  to  the  Democrats.  It  may  be  eight  years  later,  and  another  Bush,  but  the  memory  lingers  on.   Yet  for  all  of  Bush  Jnr’s  uphill  strug  gle,  some  of  his  policies  on  taxes,  edu  cation  and  defence  spending  could  appeal  to  conservative  Jewish  voters.  His  views  on  federal  support  for  reli  gious  charities,  for  example,  could  attract  Orthodox  Jews,  even  as  it  might  repel  traditional  Jewish  liberals  who  fear  any  association  between  state  and  religion.  Also,  his  mostly  Jewish  team  of  advisers  on  foreign  policy  are  even  more  hawkish  on  Israel  than  the  Ehud  Barak  govern   ment  or  Gore.   Despite  the  pro-Israel  line,  George  W  Bush  finds  himself  “behind  the  eight-ball”  with  most  Jews.  For  one  thing,  Israel  is  less  a  “Jewish""  issue  than  in  previous  elections.  Yet  here’s  the  incentive:  if  Bush  Jnr  could  some  how  win  back  even  half  of  the  Jewish  voters  who  voted  for  Bush  Snr  the  first  time  around  in  1988,  it  could  be  enough,  in  a  close  race,  to  capture  a  state  such  as  New  York  or  California  or  even  both  —  and  so  the  White  House.

"  Trial  ends  with  claim  of  Jewish  conspiracy   Douglas  Davis   LONDON:  David  Irving  told  the  High   Court  in  London  last  week  that  some  of  the  world's  largest  Jewish  organisations  are  involved  in  an  international  conspiracy  against   him.   The  self-described  Holocaust  revisionist's  claim  was  the  centre   piece  of  his  104-page  closing  address  at  the  end  of  a  two-month  libel  case  against  American  Holocaust  historian  Dr  Deborah  Lipstadt  and  her  British  publisher,  Penguin  Books.   Irving  has  alleged  that  his  reputation  was  damaged  and  his  career  wrecked  by  Lipstadt's  1994  book,  Denying  the  Holocaust:  The  Growing  Assault  on  Truth  and  Memory,  which,  he  claims,  depicted  him  as  a  Holocaust  denier  who  distorts  his  torical  data  to  suit  his  own  ideological  goals.   The  trial,  which  has  attracted  international  attention,  has  been  described  as  the  most  important  trial  involving  the  Holocaust  since  Adolf  Eichmann,  the  chief  engineer  of  the  Holocaust,  was  convicted  in  Israel  in  1961.  A  ruling  is  expected  to  be  delivered  in  about  three  weeks.   The  plaintiff  and  defendant  have  shown  sharply  contrasting  styles.  Irving  -  who  served  as  his  own  attorney  and  appeared  to  relish  the  spotlight  -  wasted  no  opportunity  in  and  out  of  court  to  make  statements  supporting  his  claims  that  Auschwitz  was  not  a  death  camp  or   that  there  was  no  systematic,  mass  destruction  of  Jews;  Lipstadt,  a  professor  at  Emory  University  in  Atlanta,  has  sat  silently  throughout  the  proceedings.   Asserting  that  Israeli  Holocaust  specialist  Yehuda  Bauer  paid  for  and  directed  Lipstadt's  book,  Irving  alleged  that  Bauer  urged  Lipstadt  to  incriminate  him.  The  book,  said  Irving,  is  part  of  a  30-year  international  campaign,  led  by  the  Anti-Jewish  Defamation  League,  the  American  Jewish  Committee,  the  Simon  Wiesenthal  Centre,  JTA,  the  Board  of  Deputies  of  British  Jews  and  others,  which  had  aimed  to  discredit  him.  —   Lipstadt's  book,  said  Irving,  is  part  of  a  30-year   international  campaign,  led  by  the  Anti-Defamation   League,  American  Jewish  Committee,  Simon  Wiesenthal   Centre,  JTA,  Board  of  Deputies  of  British  Jews  and  others,   which  aimed  to  discredit  him.  —   ""It  is  quite  evident  that  the  ADL,  in  cahoots  with  Lipstadt,  set  itself  the  task  of  destroying  my  career,""  he  said,  asserting  that  ""the  real  defendants  in  this  case  are  not  represented   in  this  court"".   But,  he  added,  ""we  have  them  to  thank  for  the  spectacle  that  has  been  presented  in  this  courtroom  since  January.""  Without  their  financial  assistance,  he  said,  it  is  doubtful  whether  the  expensive  defence   team  could  have  ""mounted  this   colossal  assault  on  my  name"".   As  a  result  of  their  campaign,  he  continued,  Germany,  Austria,  Canada,  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  South  Africa  have  banned  him.   Irving  has  represented  himself  -  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  large  legal  team  defending  Lipstadt  -  and  he  claimed  that  the  defence  case  had  cost  some  $US6  million  and  at  least  20  combined  years  of  research.  ""This  blinding  and  expensive  spotlight  has  been  focused  on  the  narrowest  of  issues,""  he  said,  ""yet  it  has  still  generated  more  noise  than  illumination."" &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   Irving  has  described  Auschwitz  as  a  ""fable""  and  insisted  that  there   was  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  Hitler  ordered  the  systematic  mass  destruction  of  the  Jews.   He  was  particularly  scathing  about  JTA  (the  Jewish  Telegraphic  Agency),  claiming  that  it  provided  material  in  1992  for  Lipstadt's  assertion  that  Irving  was  to  have  participated  in  a  gathering  in  Sweden,  which  was  later  cancelled,  that  would  have  been  a  ""confluence  between  anti-Israel,  antisemitic  and  Holocaust  denial  forces"".  Among  others  who  Lipstadt  said  were  scheduled  to  attend  the  conference  were  Nation  of  Islam  leader  Louis  Farrakhan,  Holocaust  revisionists,  representatives  of  the  Islamic  fundamentalist  groups  Hezbollah  and  Hamas,  and  the  ultranationalist  Russian  group  Pamyat.   Irving  also  claimed  that  a  1995  JTA  report  accused  him  of  ""having  supplied  the  trigger  mechanism  for  the  Oklahoma  City  bomb"".  ""That  item,""Irving  told  the  court,  ""was  picked  up  by  the  American,  and  then  faintly  echoed  by  the  British,  press.  It  was  only  months  later  that  I  found  out  who  had  started  that  lie.""   A  JTA  report,  dated  March  4,  1996,  said  Timothy  McVeigh's  lawyer  had  gone  to  London  to  investigate  whether  British  neo-Nazis  provided  components  for  the  Oklahoma  City  bombing  in  April  1995  that  killed  168  people.  The  report  named  Irving  as  one  of  three  British  citizens  whom  the  FBI  had  subpoenaed  to  ""provide  information  on  the  alleged  European  link""  behind  the  bombing.   In  his  24-page  closing  address,  defence  lawyer  Richard  Rampton   Dr  Deborah  Lipstadt   declared  that  the  trial  had  exposed  Irving's  views  as  a  ""fraud"".  Irving  based  his  claim  that  Auschwitz  was  not  a  death  camp  on  pseudo-scientific  research,  said  Rampton.  He  noted  that  Irving  has  never  travelled   David  Irving   to  Auschwitz  to  examine  the  archaeological  remains  or  the  documentary  evidence  in  its  archive.   ""It  follows  that  some  other  reason  must  be  sought  to  explain  his  devotion  over  many  years  to  the  bizarre  idea  that  no  significant  numbers  of  people  were  murdered  in  the  homicidal  gas  chambers  at  Auschwitz/  Birkenau,""  said  Rampton.   The  reasons,  he  continued,  were  not  hard  to  find:  ""As  the  evidence  in  this  court  has  shown,""  he  said,  ""Irving  is  a  right-wing  extremist,  a  racist,  and,  in  particular,  a  rabid   antisemite.""   Whether  antisemitism  had  led  him  to  become  a  Hitler  apologist  or  vice  versa  was  unimportant,  added  Rampton.  ""Whether  they  are  taken  together  or  individually,  it  is  clear  that  they  have  led  him  to  prostitute  his  reputation  as  a  serious  historian  -  spurious  though  it  can  now  be  seen  to  have  been  -  for  the  sake  of  a  bogus  rehabilitation  of  Hitler  and  the  dissemination  of  his  virulent   antisemitic  propaganda.

"  Cosgrove  pays   homage  as  Jewish  Anzacs  remember   Stefan  Bialoguski   THE  poignant  irony  of  war  was  a  recurring  theme  at  a  moving  Anzac  Day  service  at  the  Great  Synagogue  on  Sunday.   The  Commander  of  Australia’s  forces  in  East  Timor,  Major-General  Peter  Cosgrove  AC,  MC,  addressed  more  than  1000  people,  after  200  Jewish  veterans  had  marched  in  brilliant  sunshine  along  Elizabeth  Street,  led  by  the  City  of  Holroyd  Band,  proudly  show  ing  that  they  too  have  not  been  wearied  by   age.   By  the  time  they  arrived  at  the  Great,  the  entrance  was  lined  with  laurel  wreaths  laid   by  community  organisations  in  honour  of  those  who,  in  the  words  of  the  remem  brance  prayer  recited  by  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple,  “fought  for  freedom,  justice  and  democracy”,  and  the  “martyrs  of  the  Holocaust  whose  blood  was  spilt  like  water  by  evil  men”.   But  in  remembering  the  historic  sacrifice  of  friends  and  family,  thoughts  also  turned  to  hopes  for  the  future  encapsulated  in  the  last  line  of  the  remembrance  prayer:  “May  the  work  of  righteousness  be  peace:  may  righteousness  bring  quietness  and  assur   ance  for  ever”.   In  his  address,  Major-General  Cosgrove  noted:  “Symbolic  of  the  irony  and  the  ulti  mate  folly  of  war  is  that  our  fierce  and  res  olute  foe  at  Gallipoli  is  now  our  warm   friend.”   The  irony  was  given  a  further  twist  in  the  make-up  of  the  congregation,  exemplified  by  the  translation  of  a  summary  of  the  gener  al’s  speech  into  Russian.  For  just  as  Australia’s  Jewish  community  contributed  with  disproportionate  involvement  to  their  country’s  war  effort  85  years  ago,  so  too  did  the  Jews  of  Germany  and  Austro-Hungary.  And  the  possibility  of  Jews  facing  each  other  from  opposing  trenches  was  raised  again  50  years  later  in  the  Cold  War.   But  the  only  thing  resembling  an  Iron  Curtain  was  the  wall  of  medals  displayed  by  the  veterans.  The  uniting  in  remembrance  and  thanksgiving  of  those  who  could  once  have  been  foes  added  further  poignancy  to  the  conclusion  of  Major-General  Cosgrove’s  address  —  a  quotation  from  Turkey’s  found   ing  father  Kemal  Attaturk’s  reflection  on  the  common  humanity  of  all  those  who  fell  at  Gallipoli.   “There  is  no  difference  between  the   Johnnies  and  the  Mehmets  to  us  where  they  lie  side  by  side,  here  in  this  country  of  ours.  You,  the  mothers  who  sent  your  sons  from  faraway  countries  —  wipe  away  your  tears.  Your  sons  are  now  living  in  our  bosom  and  are  in  peace.”   In  his  introduction,  NSW  Association  of  Jewish  Ex-Servicemen  and  Women  (Najex)  president  Wesley  Browne  OAM  said  there  was  no-one  more  fitting  to  address  the  Anzac  Day  service  than  Major-General  Cosgrove,  who  was  decorated  for  bravery  in  the  Vietnam  War  and  “who  appreciates  the  tradition  of  the  Anzac  spirit”.   “Symbolic  of  the  irony  and  the  ultimate  folly  of  war  is  that  our   fierce  and  resolute  foe  at  Gallipoli   is  now  our  warm  friend.”   Major-General  Cosgrove  told  the  service  how  proud,  and  humbled,  he  was  to  have  commanded  Australia’s  Interfet  force  in  East   Timor.  “You  would  have  been  proud  of  them  as  I  was.  You  may  have  seen  yourselves  in  them,  as  1  do.  In  making  that  comparison,  I  can  extend  to  them  no  higher  honour.”   He  added:  “In  no  way  would  I  ever  seek  to  compare  East  Timor  with  other  conflicts,  but  I  will  happily  compare  our  young  men  and  women  with  their  illustrious  forebears.”   And  he  used  the  occasion  to  pay  tribute  to  the  Jewish  community’s  contribution  to  Australia’s  defence:  “Sir  John  Monash,  arguably  Australia’s  best  commander  on  that  first  Anzac  Day.  His  years  of  loyal  serv  ice  stand  as  a  metaphor  for  the  continuing  support  of  the  Jewish  community  to  the  spirit  of  Anzac.”   Delivering  the  vote  of  thanks,  Rabbi  Apple  compared  Major-General  Cosgrove  favourably  with  Major-General  Sir  John  Monash.  “[Monash’s]  troops  had  confi   Major-General  Peter  Cosgrove  addresses  the  Anzac  Day  service  at  the  Great  Synagogue  on  Sunday.

"  “Jewish  ethics  vital   in  sport  and  business”   Chantal  Abiibol   STEPHEN  Rubin,  London-based  owner  of  Speedo  Australia,  built  a  sports  industry  empire  based  on  one  unshakeable  principle:  “You  don’t  make  it  first  and  then  become  ethi  cal.  You  start  out  being  ethical  and  then  you   make  it.”   His  preoccupation  with  ethics  is  equally  evi  dent  in  his  determination  to  combat  discrimi  nation  in  all  its  forms.  “I  have  fought  all  my  life  for  ‘never  again’,  which  means  that  the  Holocaust  happened,  but  shouldn’t  ever  hap  pen  again  to  anyone  anywhere.  It’s  not  just  about  the  Jewish  people,  it’s  about  all  people.”   Owner  of  the  Pentland  Group,  which  includes  such  brands  as  Speedo,  Mitre  and  ellesse,  Mr  Rubin  was  in  Sydney  to  monitor  and  limit  ambush  marketing  during  the  Olympics  and  to  confer  with  other  international  firms.   As  chairman  of  Britain’s  Jewish  Association  of  Business  Ethics,  he  is  concerned  with  the  need  to  promote  this  concept.  “Jewish  busi  ness  ethics  occupies  a  major  component  of  Jewish  law,  where  there  are  more  laws  for  busi  ness  than  for  the  whole  of  Shabbat  and  kosher  food  put  together,”  he  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.  “Our  job  is  to  let  young  people  know  how  important  it  is  to  carry  out  business   in  an  ethical  manner.”   The  Association  runs  seminars  in  which  par  ticipants  tackle  ethical  dilemmas.  “The  govern  ment  has  offered  us  land  for  a  factory  at  a  ridiculous  price,  but  we  would  have  to  knock  down  a  rainforest  in  the  process;  what  do  we  do?  We  discuss  what  is  right  and  wrong.  It’s  always  easier  to  be  successful  when  you’re  eth   ical.”   Graduating  with  a  law  degree  from  University  College,  London,  Mr  Rubin  soon  established  himself  as  an  entrepreneur,  starting  out  in  his  family’s  business,  Pentland  Group.  At  31,  he  was  elected  chairman.  Current  president  of  the  World  Federation  of  the  Sporting  Goods  Industry,  which  is  affiliated  to  the  International  Olympic  Committee,  he  is  also  president  of  the   “It's  always  easier  to  be  successful   when  you’re  ethical.”   World  Sports  Foundation  and  has  served  as   director  of  Reebok  International  and  as  world  president  of  the  Textile  Institute.   Indeed,  the  hypothetical  dilemmas  he  pres   ents  at  the  seminars  are  actual  issues  with   which  he  contends  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Three  years  ago,  when  it  became  evident  that  manu  facturers  in  Pakistan  —  the  source  of  75  per  cent  of  the  world’s  billion-dollar  soccer  ball  market—were  involved  in  child  labour,  he  pio  neered  a  project  with  other  major  sports  goods  and  human  rights  groups  to  remove  children  from  the  industry.   “There  is  probably  more  slavery  in  the  world  today  than  there  was  100  years  ago.  We’ve  worked  hard  in  Pakistan,  Vietnam  and  India  to  eliminate  children  from  the  labour  area,  but  at  the  same  time  we  have  to  ensure  they  don’t  go  into  worse  things,  such  as  prostitution.”   The  project  not  only  established  independ  ent  monitoring  systems,  but  persuaded  50  global  brands  —  including  Nike,  Puma  and  Reebok  —  to  purchase  Pakistan-produced  soc  cer  balls  only  from  manufacturers  who  partici  pated  in  the  monitoring  program.  It  also  imple  mented  a  social  protection  program  to  provide  educational  and  other  opportunities  to  former  child  labourers.   However,  in  seeking  to  abolish  child  labour,  other  complications  arise  because  of  cultural  differences.  “By  saying  children  cannot  work  at  home  and  only  in  registered  stitching  centres,  we  might  solve  that  problem,  but  we  are  disen  franchising  Muslims  who  are  orthodox  and  will  not  leave  the  home.  We  take  away  their  right  to  work  and  make  an  income.  In  solving  one  prob  lem  for  a  few  children,  we  probably  create  a  big  ger  one  for  a  larger  number  of  women,  which  again  we  are  working  on.”   Asked  to  comment  on  negative  press  that  Nike  has  received  in  relation  to  its  Indonesian   Stephen  Rubin   plant,  Mr  Rubin  said:  “Nike  is  probably  in  the  forefront  of  companies  which  are  doing  a  good  job.  The  problem  is  that  when  you  sell  millions  of  pairs  of  shoes  and  operate  from  a  large  num  ber  of  factories,  it’s  difficult  to  control  every  single  thing  that  every  factory  does.”   He  also  blames  the  media  for  exacerbating  the  problem  by  not  reporting  issues  in  context.  “When  you  find  child  labour  in  a  particular  fac  tory  and  the  media  say  ‘get  rid  of  them,  fire  them’,  you  can  bring  enormous  hardship  to  those  families.  Of  course,  if  the  labour  is  haz  ardous,  it  must  be  stopped;  but  in  other  cases,  where  children  are  working  to  put  other  chil  dren  through  college  or  to  look  after  ill  parents,  you  have  to  stop  it  over  a  period  of  time  to  ensure  that  the  family  still  has  an  income.  The  media  is  more  sensationalist  than  it  needs  to  be.”   Deeply  committed  to  Jewish-related  issues,  Mr  Rubin  chairs  the  Interparliamentary  Council  Against  Antisemitism,  which  is  based  in  London,  but  has  members  from  all  over  the  world.  The  most  effective  means  of  stopping  discrimination  is  through  education,  he  said,  which  he  promotes  as  president  of  the  Holocaust  Education  Trust.   His  communal  involvement  also  includes  interfaith  work,  and  he  is  vice-chair  of  the  British  Council  for  Christians  and  Jews.  “It’s  all  in  the  interests  of  helping  us  get  along  with  peo  ple  from  other  faith  groups.”   In  addition  to  all  that,  he  chairs  the  Jewish  World’s  Hall  of  Fame,  located  at  the  Wingate  Institute  of  Sport  in  Israel.  “As  we  eventually  have  peace  in  Israel,  the  hero  of  the  Jewish  sol  dier  will  vanish  and  we  hope  to  replace  it  with  the  Jewish  and  Israeli  sportsperson.”   As  far  as  the  Sydney  Olympics  are  con  cerned,  “there’s  a  great  atmosphere  here,  which  is  so  different  from  Atlanta.  In  the  States,  the  American  sporting  spirit  is  not  very  good  in  terms  of  supporting  non-American  teams,  whereas  in  Sydney  you  hear  commentators  say  ‘Go  Australia’,  yet  still  give  the  others  a  clap,  and  everybody  cheers  for  every  other  team.  That’s  important  and  that’s  the  spirit  of  the  Olympics.” ",2000-09-29
"  Jewish  exploration  in  the  wider  world   VIEWPOINT   MELANIE  SCHWARTZ   IN  my  undergraduate  degree,  I  majored  in  litera  ture  and  philosophy.  Having  spent  three  years  of  my  life  exploring  some  of  the  great  thinkers  and  writers  of  history,  I  thought  it  fair  to  allot  a  year  to  studying  the  great  thinkers  and  writers  of  Jewish  history.   That  was  the  initial  opportunity  that  the  Graduate  Diploma  in  Jewish  Studies  offered  me  —  to  further  my  acquaintance  with  Judaism  and  Jewish  thought,  from  Rabbi  Akiva  to  Yehuda  Amichai,  from  Maimonides  to  Martin  Buber  -  and  all  this  at  an  institution  which  has  a  student-staff  ratio  of  2:1.   Being  a  Moriah  graduate,  I  arrived  at  the  Oxford  Centre  for  Hebrew  and  Jewish  Studies  expecting  a  group  of  people  from  a  similar  back  ground,  looking  to  further  their  knowledge  base  of  things  Jewish.  Rather,  1  found  a  Catholic  Pole  who  once  trained  for  the  priesthood,  a  Muslim  Jordanian  who  works  for  his  government  in  inter  faith  relations,  a  Mormon  ex-missionary  with  an  interest  in  Israeli  cinema,  a  Christian  Italian  trans  lator  of  Arabic,  Hebrew  and  Italian  poetry,  and  a  Bulgarian  linguist  with  an  interest  in  the  unex  plored  Jewish  treasures  of  her  country.  To  name   a  few.   The  diversity  of  the  backgrounds  of  the  candi  dates  for  the  program  astounded  me:  two  prac  tising  Jews  in  a  group  of  20.  What  was  the  attrac  tion  for  the  others?  Slowly,  it  began  to  make  more  sense.  Theologians  and  scholars  of  comparative  religion  sought  a  better  acquaintance  with  the  founding  monotheistic  faith.  Linguists  were  drawn  to  the  intensive  language  component  of  the  course.  For  historians,  the  opportunity  to  delve  into  Josephus  or  Enlightenment  Europe  was  a  great  drawcard.  Those  with  an  interest  in  the  Middle  East  were  attracted  to  the  courses  on  Judaism  and  Islam  and  Israeli  politics.   The  only  difficulty  that  remained  was  my  own:  how  would  I  feel  studying  such  subjects  as  the  Shoah,  Zionism  and  the  Bible  with  people  whose  reference  points  and  involvement  with  these  top  ics  differed  so  vastly  from  mine?   As  it  turned  out,  it  was  this  element  of  the  pro  gram  that  made  die  course  as  thought-provok  ing,  enriching  and  challenging  as  it  was.  For  the  first  dme,  I  was  studying  with  people  who  were  outside  the  Jewish  tradition  with  which  we  were  engaging.  Each  piece  of  information  we  addressed  had  to  be  approached  not  through  an  innate  or  empirical  intuition,  but  rather  explained  and  clarified  anew.  My  time  at  Oxford  offered  me   This  year’s  Biblical  Hebrew  Class  at  the  Oxford  Centre  for  Hebrew  and  Jewish  Studies,  from  left:  Tammy  Reiss  (USA),  Melanie  Schwartz  (Sydney),  Maria-Luisa  Langella  (Italy).   something  essential  to  a  balanced  understanding  of  Judaism,  Jewish  History  and  Jewish  thought—  a  context  for  Judaism.  I  now  feel  1  have  gained  an  appreciation  of  Judaism  inasmuch  as  it  is  a  reli  gion,  which  strives  towards  many  of  the  same  ends  as  other  religions.  Such  an  approach  facili   When  nothing  is  taken  for  granted,  everything  is  subject  to  investigation,   so  the  eventual  yield  is  much  richer.   tates  better  understanding  of  central  ideas,  from  the  way  that  the  tradition  that  we  follow  today  was  bom  out  of  the  innovative  response  of  the  rabbis  to  exile,  to  how  Israeli  literature  is  both  a  product  and  critique  of  the  unique  predicaments  and  tensions  existing  in  the  country.   Studying  Talmud  -  a  privilege  never  offered  at  school  —  with  people  totally  unfamiliar  with  the  nature  of  Jewish  law  deepened  my  own  interac  tion  and  appreciation  of  it.  When  nothing  is  taken  for  granted,  everything  is  subject  to  investigation,  and  so  the  eventual  yield  is  much  richer.  That  said,  the  academic  gain  was  secondary  to  the  great  friends  1  now  have  from  all  over  the  globe,  who  have  given  me  a  window  to  their  own  cul  tures,  values  and  lifestyles.   The  diversity  of  the  candidates  was  not,  how  ever,  a  factor  which  functioned  to  the  detriment  of  the  Jewish  nature  of  my  time  in  Oxford.  I  was  a  regular  guest  of  one  of  my  lecturers  for  dinner  on  Friday  nights,  and  attended  the  community-run  synagogue  in  Oxford,  which,  along  with  the  thriv   ing  student  JSoc,  fills  the  gap  left  by  the  departure  of  Rabbi  Shmuley  Boteach’s  L’Chaim  Society.  Along  with  the  other  Jewish  student  in  the  course,  I  hosted  several  Shabbat  dinners  for  the  rest  of  our  group,  complete  with  a  demonstration  Kabbalat  Shabbat  service.  On  the  academic  front,  the  busy  lecture  programs  of  the  Middle  East  Centre  and  the  Oriental  Studies  Department  sup  plemented  the  weekly  lectures  that  were  hosted  at  the  Oxford  Centre  for  Hebrew  and  Jewish  Studies.   All  this  leaves  aside  the  incredible  nature  of  being  part  of  Oxford  University.  The  Oxford  Union  holds  weekly  formal  debates  in  its  famous  debating  chamber,  where  I  heard  Bill  Wyman,  bassist  of  the  Rolling  Stones,  argue  that  rock   music  is  the  greatest  art  form,  and  major  figures  in  peace  movements  propose  that  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  just  war.  I  heard  Larry  FTynt,  Stephen  Hawking,  Richard  Branson,  Billy  Bragg  and  Mohammed  A1  Fayed.  I  saw  the  room  in  which  Bob  Hawke  broke  the  world  record  for  beer-drinking.  I  went  to  Oxford-Cambridge  varsi  ty  lacrosse  matches  (we  won)  and  black-tie  all  night  college  balls.   The  Centre  provided  a  tranquil  setting  con  ducive  to  study,  with  all  the  activity  of  Oxford  at  our  disposal.  Major  works  of  Hebrew  fiction  have  been  written  in  residence  at  the  Centre  by  authors  such  as  Amos  Oz  and  A.B.  Yehoshua.  It  is  also  home  to  the  Qumran  Project,  where  a  com  plete  photographic  record  of  the  Dead  Sea  Scrolls  has  been  deposited.  Due  to  his  involvement  with  this  project,  Professor  Alan  Crown  of  Sydney  University  is  a  regular  visiting  scholar  at  the  Centre.  The  Centre  is  also  an  established  meeting  point  for  visiting  scholars  of  Jewish  Studies  from  all  over  the  world,  who,  since  they  also  live  in  res  idence,  were  available  to  us  for  assistance  in  researching  our  dissertations.  Thesis  topics  ranged  from  “The  Representations  of  Minorities  in  Israeli  Cinema”  and  “An  Analysis  of  the  1977  Israeli  Elections”  to  “Closing  of  the  Gates:  An  Examination  of  the  Symbolism  and  Meaning  of  the  Ne’ilah  Prayer”.  My  own  dissertation  was  concerned  with  the  problems  encountered  in  teaching  the  God  concept  to  children.   When  I  received  my  application  pack  for  apply  ing  to  the  Oxford  Centre  for  Hebrew  and  Jewish  Studies,  I  spent  a  good  few  days  scrutinising  the  aerial  photo  of  Yamton  Manor  Estate  in  a  state  of  awe.  The  possibility  that  this  17th-century  manorhouse  would  become  my  home  seemed  farfetched.  Yet  I  can’t  look  at  the  same  picture  now  without  seeing  the  thriving,  dynamic,  close  knit  Centre  which  provided  me  with  an  incredible  opportunity  for  learning  and  scholastic  growth,  and  participation  in  one  of  the  greatest  academic   communities  in  the  world.   E3  The  Oxford  Centre  for  Hebrew  and  Jewish  Studies  offers  the  one  year  Diploma  program  to  graduate  students  of  any  discipline.  The  course  involves  intensive  language  study,  a  choice  of  a  broad  range  of  taught  courses  and  a  supervised  dis  sertation,  and  the  Centre  awards  up  to  25  full  or  par  tial  scholarships  each  academic  year,  which  include  tuition  and  accommodation.

"  International   Just  who  is  Jewish  in  the  USA?   NEW  YORK:  William  Cohen’s  father  was  Jewish,  but  his  mother  was  not.   The  young  Cohen  attended  Hebrew  school  for  years,  but  shortly  before  his  barmitzvah,  the  rabbi  informed  him  he  would  have  to  undergo  a  con  version  since  he  was  not  Jewish  according  to  Halacha.   Offended,  Cohen  walked  out  of  the  synagogue,  never  to  return.  Now  an   adult  —  and  the  US  Secretary  of  Defence  —  Cohen  is  married  to  a  Christian  woman.   Should  William  Cohen  be  counted  as  Jewish?  Should  he  be  counted  among  the  intermarried?   Identity  questions  raised  by  people  far  less  prominent  than  Cohen  are  challenging  the  planners  of  National  Jewish  Population  Study  2000  —  designed  to  achieve  an  accurate  pic  ture  of  American  Jewry.  It  is  due  to  get  under  way  in  May.   “Pizza  shops  don’t  lie”   In  an  effort  to  address  the  chal  lenges,  organisers  of  the  study  have  made  a  major  decision:  to  take  into  account  the  nuances  of  Jewish  identi  ty  so  that  in  analysing  issues  such  as  intermarriage,  the  William  Cohens  can  be  separated  from  Jews  whose  Jewishness  cannot  be  questioned.   The  $US5  million  study  —  the  first  national  census  of  American  Jews  in  10  years  —  is  charged  with  providing  data  on  everything  from  intermar  riage  rates  to  level  of  Jewish  identity  to  philanthropic  habits  to  assessing  whether  the  decade’s  proliferation  of  continuity  initiatives  have  had  any  impact.  It  is  expected  to  shape  the  pri  orities  of  Jewish  organisations  and  scholars  for  the  coming  decade.   The  debate  parallels  the  outreach  versus-inreach  debate:  to  what  extent  should  resources  be  invested  in  reaching,  or  studying,  those  who  have   only  tenuous  connections  to  the  Jewish  community,  as  opposed  to  focusing  on  more  committed  Jews?  The  study’s  planners  have  the  sticky  task  of  determining  who  to  count  —  and  what  to  ask.   The  census  has  been  postponed  until  May  ostensibly  so  that  leaders  of  its  sponsor  organisation  —  the  newly  formed  United  Jewish  Communities  —  have  time  to  add  input.   But  the  survey  has  snagged  its  share  of  controversy,  mostly  stem  ming  from  dissatisfaction  with  what  happened  in  1990.  Several  demogra  phers  have  questioned  the  finding  that  52  percent  of  Jews  who  married  between  1985  and  1990  married  a  non-Jew,  suggesting  that  a  more  accu  rate  count  is  10-20  percentage  points  lower.  Some  Orthodox  leaders  claim  their  community  was  under-counted  in  1990  due  to  methodology  that  may  have  disproportionately  emphasised  Jews  in  areas  where  Orthodox  Jews  are  less  likely  to  cluster.   Community  studies  tend  not  to  interview  those  on  the  margins  of  the  community,  says  University  of  Miami  demographer  Ira  Sheskin,  who  has  conducted  20  such  studies  and  authored  a  forthcoming  book  com  paring  the  findings.   Hebrew  University  sociologist  Steven  Cohen  and  columnist  J  J  Goldberg  have  used  Sheskin’s  studies  —  which  find  much  lower  intermar  riage  rates  and  higher  rates  of  Jewish  ritual  activity  than  the  national  study  —  as  further  reason  to  question  the  validity  of  the  1990  findings.  But  Sheskin  says  the  differences  can  be  attributed  less  to  inaccuracy  in  the  national  study  and  more  to  the  fact  that  it  casts  a  wide  net.  Also,  Jews  liv  ing  outside  the  large  communities  that  commission  the  studies  are  more  likely  to  intermarry,  he  said.   A  number  of  changes  are  being  made  in  this  year’s  study—which  will  survey  by  phone  5000  people,  more   us  Defence  Secretary  William  Cohen  ...  walked  away  from  Judaism.  Photo:  AAP/AP   than  double  the  sample  of  1990.  In  1990,  only  “yes”  or  “no”  answers  were  recorded  when  asking  whether  the  subject  had  Jewish  parents  and  was  raised  Jewish.  This  time,  “in  addition  to  yes  or  no,  we  are  going  to  let  peo  ple  say  ‘maybe,  I  suppose,  half  and  half’,”  said  Sheskin.   In  addition,  this  year’s  study  will  limit  the  number  of  interviews  with   marginal  Jews  to  500  people.  “Certain  questions  aren’t  relevant  to  those  people,  and  this  will  save  resources,  so  we  can  do  better  job  in  other  places.  The  whole  thing  is  a  series  of   tradeoffs.”   Responding  to  concerns  that  changing  the  study  will  make  it  diffi  cult  to  compare  the  findings  from  1990,  the  study  may  list  several  sets  of   statistics  —  one  that  can  be  com   pared  to  the  1990  rate  by  casting  as  wide  a  net  and  another  that  uses  a  stricter  definition  of  Jews  and  inter  marriage.   After  the  data  is  collected,  researchers  are  considering  using  a  variety  of  weighting  techniques,  a  sta  tistical  way  of  compensating  for  seg  ments  of  the  population  that  are  least  likely  to  respond  to  surveys  and  thus  might  not  be  represented  accurately.  In  1990,  researchers  used  US  census  weights,  but  demographers  have  questioned  the  validity  of  those  weights,  which  assume,  for  example,  that  people  in  the  south  and  rural  areas  respond  less.  -   It  is  not  clear  to  what  extent  Orthodox  critiques  will  be  addressed.  Rabbi  David  Eliezrie,  a  Los  Angeles  Chabad  leader,  believes  locating  sub  jects  by  randomly  dialling  numbers  may  not  fairly  represent  densely  pop  ulated  Orthodox  communities  or  account  for  the  significantly  larger  family  sizes  in  Orthodox  households.  “Pizza  shops  don’t  lie,”  he  said,  refer  ring  to  the  proliferation  of  kosher  restaurants,  and  other  services  cater  ing  to  Orthodox  Jews,  in  communities  throughout  the  country.   This  year’s  study  will  not  repeat  the  practice  of  conducting  calls  on  Shabbat  or  Jewish  holidays  —  a  cost  cutting  measure  in  which  the  screen  ing  was  tacked  onto  surveys  conduct  ed  by  outside  firms.  That  may  make  a  small  difference  in  counting,  said  Sheskin,  but  the  main  reason  the  Orthodox  community  appears  anec  dotally  to  be  on  the  increase  while  sta  tistically  it  is  stagnant  or  even  declin  ing  is  because  the  community  has  not  grown,  but  become  more  observant.  “The  Orthodox  now  are  Orthodox  to  a  much  greater  extent  than  20  years  ago,”  he  said,  but  added:  “Every  group  always  thinks  there’s  more  of  them  than  there  are.”   JTA ",2000-02-11
"  Renee  Geyer  at  the  Jewish  Migrant  Hostel  in   Greenwich  in  1956.   The  cover  of  Renee  Geyer’s  new  autobiography.   Renee  Geyer  with  INXS  lead  singer  Michael  Hutchence  in   1983.   At  Mushroom  Records'  10th  anniversary  at  Myer  Music   Bowl  in  Melbourne.   Jewish  princess  in  a  rock  V  roll  world   Shira  Sebban   SINGER  Renee  Geyer  credits  her  Jewishness  with  having  enabled  her  to  do  what  she  does  so  well  and  for  so  long.   “It’s  that  Jewish  logic,  pragmatism  and  real  istic  view  of  life,  which  is  almost  cynical  —  the  glass  is  half-empty,  not  half-full,”  the  woman  billed  as  Australia’s  best-known  soul  and  blues  singer  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.  “That  kind  of  thinking  keeps  one  balanced  and  down-to-earth.  You  never  get  too  big  for   your  boots.”   However,  such  an  outlook  can  also  be  depressing,  if  one  has  to  live  with  it  all  the  time,  she  conceded.  “Every  Jewish  person  has  a  relative  like  that.  My  father  was  Mr  down-vibe  and  painted  with  a  grey  brush.  He  was  incredibly  strict,  impatient  and  intolerant  with  his  children  if  we  didn’t  behave.  But  the  reason  why  we’re  all  still  devoted  to  him  is  because  he’s  probably  one  of  the  funniest  human  beings  and  is  so  dramatic.  I  wouldn’t  change  a  thing  about  my  childhood  because  I’m  unusual,  and  it  made  me  lead  the  life  I  have.  I  wouldn’t  have  had  the  guts  and  been  able  to  prevail  if  I  hadn’t  had  basic  training  in  guerilla  warfare  when  I  was  young.”   In  her  just-released  autobiography,  Confessions  of  a  Difficult  Woman:  The  Renee  Geyer  Story,  she  describes  her  father’s  atti  tude  to  her  music,  which  “is  not  his  cup  of  tea,  but  he  thinks  I’m  one  of  the  best  at  doing  it.  His  attitude  is  ‘Of  all  the  shit  music  out  there,  my  daughter’s  shit  music  is  the  best’.  I’m  thankful  for  the  compliment.”   Born  in  Melbourne  in  1953,  Ms  Geyer  was  three  when  her  family  moved  to  Sydney,  spending  the  next  ten  years  at  the  Jewish  Migrant  Hostel  in  Greenwich,  which  was  man  aged  by  her  parents,  Gabriella  and  Edward  Geyer,  and  run  by  the  Australian  Jewish  Welfare  Society  under  Syd  Einfeld.  Her  par  ents  subsequently  became  kosher  caterers.   Raised  in  a  traditional  and  kosher  house  hold,  where  most  of  the  males  were  rabbis  or  cantors  —  including  her  mother’s  cousin,  Temple  Emanuel  Cantor  Michael  Deutsch  —  she  found  Judaism  to  involve  “male-dominat  ed  rituals.  Men  were  really  important  when  we  were  growing  up  as  Jewish  girls.  1  didn’t  get  a  batmitzvah  because  my  mother  never  had  one,  and  at  Sunday  School,  apart  from  a  few  exceptions,  there  were  no  great  stories  about  girls  in  the  Bible.  So  as  a  strong  girl  asserting  herself  early  in  life,  one  got  bored   and  wanted  to  move  on.”   She  attended  the  Habonim  youth  move  ment,  but  “the  militancy  of  the  rhetoric  scared  me  and  coloured  my  view  of  Arabs  and  the  Middle  East  in  a  way  that  perhaps  was  unavoidable,  but  where  the  balance  was  pos  sibly  a  little  off.  After  all,  Arabs  are  not  all  ogres.”   Sent  to  Ravenswood  Methodist  Ladies  College,  from  which  she  was  eventually  expelled  for  stealing  coins  from  students’  bags  —  “my  parents  are  so  law-abiding,  it  destroyed  them”  —  she  would  be  invited  to  friends’  homes  for  dinner.  “They’d  be  having  roast  beef,  and  everyone  would  sit  quietly  around  the  table  and  ask  to  be  excused.  At  home,  my  father  would  say  ‘shut  up,  eat  that  or  get  out’.  We’d  eat  gefilte  fish  or  schnitzel  —  food  I’d  now  kill  someone  to  cook  for  me,  but  which  I  hated  in  those  days  because  of  their  strange  names.   Renee  Geyer   “There  was  a  touch  of  racism  in  the  ‘50s  and  ‘60s.  Jewish  people  were  not  really  accepted,  and  having  a  foreign  ethnicity  was  frowned  on.  My  mother  recalls  that  when  she  arrived  in  Melbourne,  the  neighbours  were  really  friendly,  but  she  never  got  invited  into  their   homes.”   Later,  when  Ms  Geyer  started  to  sing  with  bands,  she  occasionally  brought  a  black  drummer  home.  “My  parents  were  never  racist,  but  they  were  afraid  of  me  wandering  into  another  culture  and  ending  up  in  not  just  an  inter-religious,  but  an  inter-racial,  marriage.  But  then  along  came  the  Ethiopian  Jews,  which  must  have  stumped  every  European  Jew  on  the  planet.  For  years,  Jewish  parents  were  conscious  of  trying  to  keep  their  kids  within  the  community,  and   here  were  original  Jews  who  looked  like  Ray   Charles.”   Judaism  is  not  so  much  a  religion  as  a  race,  she  said.  “My  parents  and  I  have  no  idea  where  my  style  of  singing  came  from  because  I  was  always  drawn  to  black  music.  Black  southern  wailing  in  a  Baptist  church  is  not  unlike  what  Jews  do  when  davening.  It’s  mournful  and  beautiful.  I’m  no  expert,  but  these  sounds  might  have  something  to  do  with  the  suffering  both  races  have  endured  through  centuries  of  hardship.   “While  it’s  now  popular  for  whites  to  do  black  music,  when  I  started,  blue-eyed  soul  was  not  a  reality.  Black  people  in  the  United  States  liked  my  voice,  but  I  was  a  marketing  nightmare,  whereas  to  white  people  I  was  too  black-sounding.”   A  second-generation  Holocaust  survivor,  Ms  Geyer  always  knew  that  her  mother  had  been  interned  at  Auschwitz  and  that  her  grandparents,  aunt  and  cousins  had  been  killed  in  the  gas  chambers.  “We  could  never  discuss  it  then,  but  when  we  ask  now,  we  get  anything  we  want.  My  mother  has  written  a  synopsis  of  her  story  for  my  two  brothers  and  me.  She  also  recorded  a  three-hour  video  of  her  wartime  experiences  for  the  Spielbery  Foundation,  but  1  haven’t  had  the  guts  to  look  at  it  yet.  I  didn’t  like  performing  in  Germany.  You’re  playing  in  front  of  great  kids,  and  then  you  think  ‘these  are  the  grandchildren  of  the  people  who  killed  my  grandparents’.  The  older  1  get,  the  more  strongly  I  feel  about  what  my  mother  went  through  —  how  it  happened  to  the  extent  that  it  did  and  no  one  did  any  thing  until  it  was  too  late.”   Having  had  six  abortions  —  three  of  them  while  on  the  pill,  which  is  “pretty  unlucky”  —  she  maintains  that  she  was  not  ready  for  chil  dren  at  the  time.  “It  doesn’t  excuse  what  1  did,  but  my  head  wasn’t  where  it  should  have  been  to  be  a  mother  in  those  days.  It  wasn’t  an  easy  decision,  but  I  don’t  regret  it.  Now  1  could  handle  having  children.  You  can’t  pre  dict  when  your  brain  catches  up  with  your  hormones,  when  sensibility  catches  up  with   “You  can't  predict  when  your  brain   catches  up  with  your  hormones,  when  sensibility  catches  up  with   recklessness.”   recklessness.  It  would  have  been  an  injustice  to  those  children.  My  mother  would  have  ended  up  raising  them  and  1  don’t  think  that’s  right.  I’m  not  proud  of  it,  and  every  single  time  was  traumatic.  People  make  mistakes.  You  can  fall  pregnant,  and  if  acted  on  swiftly,  I  don’t  think  you’re  dealing  with  murder,  but  I  still  feel  guilty.  It’s  a  horrible  thing  to  go  through.”   Describing  herself  as  a  Jewish  princess  in  a  rock  ‘n’  roll  world  —  “there  are  trucks,  road  ies,  alcohol  and  drugs,  and  I’m  still  thinking  of  the  bag  from  Double  Bay  that  I’d  like  to  get”  —  Ms  Geyer  wakes  up  feeling  good  every  day  “because  I’m  stupid.  I  was  doing  drugs,  over  dosing  [three  times  on  heroin]  and  doing  more  drugs,  based  on  an  innocent,  happy,  hopeful  will  to  have  another  go  at  life.  Only  later  in  the  day  does  panic  set  in.  When  I  was  living  in  the  US,  every  day  meant  a  new  diet.”   Physically  self-conscious  —  “I  always  was  and  always  will  be”  —  she  is  now  less  con  cerned  about  what  people  think  of  her  and  has  come  to  appreciate  the  increasing  num  ber  of  independent  women  who  attend  her  concerts.  “It’s  still  very  much  a  man’s  world,  but  when  I  see  women  in  their  40s  who’ve  done  really  well,  I  feel  a  strong  kinship  with   them.”   She  also  feels  an  affinity  with  what  she  calls  the  “new”  generation  of  Australian  Jewry.  “There’s  nothing  better  than  the  funny,  realis  tic  attitude  of  Jews  and  the  incredibly  laid  back,  easy-going  humour  of  Australians.  It’s   an  attractive  combination  that  didn’t  exist   when  1  was  young.”   But  such  affinity  only  goes  so  far:  “I’ve  never  sung  Hava  Nagila  at  a  gig,  and  I  never  will.” ",2000-05-26
"  PeterEjihross   NEW  YORK:  One  of  the  films  nominated  for   an  Academy  Award  this  year  stemmed  from  an  exhibition  —  and  a  film-maker’s   instinct.   Until  he  saw  a  historical  display  on  life  in  South  Wales  several  years  ago,  Paul  Morrison  never  knew  that  Jews  had  lived  among  the  Welsh  working  class  —  let  alone  that  there  were  riots  against  Jews  there  in  the  early  part  of  the  20th  century.   But  the  writer  and  director  of  Solomon  and  Gaenor  —  a  nominee  for  this  year’s  Oscar  for  Best  Foreign  Film,  says  that  once  he  learned  the  history,  he  knew  that  the  1911  clash  between  tough  Welsh  miners  and  immigrant  Jewish  shopowners  would  provide  a  perfect  backdrop  for  a  love  story.   “I  just  had  the  image  of  the  black-coated  Jew  from  Eastern  Europe  and  these  chapel-going  Welsh  miners,”  says  Morrison,  who  lives  in  London.  “The  juxtaposition  of  cultures.  Both  of  them  being  Old  Testament  people.”   The  result  is  Romeo  and  Juliet—with  a  Jewish  twist.  The  film,  scheduled  to  be  released  in  the  United  States  in  August,  focuses  on  a  love  affair  between  the  Jewish,  Yiddish-speaking  Solomon  (loan  Gruffudd)  and  the  Christian,  Welsh-speak  ing  Gaenor  (Nia  Roberts).   Both  families,  while  portrayed  sympathetical  ly,  are  depicted  as  provincial  in  their  desires  to  keep  the  lovers  apart.  Gaenor’s  family  belongs  to  a  strictly  Protestant  community  —  in  one  scene,  Gaenor  is  cast  out  of  the  community  in  a  display  worthy  of  Nathaniel  Hawthorne’s  The  Scarlet  Letter.  By  contrast,  Solomon,  who  lives  in  a  neighbouring  valley,  is  the  son  of  religious,  immigrant  shopkeepers  who  dreams  of  opening  up  his  own  shop.  Uneasy  with  his  Jewish  back  ground,  Solomon  hides  his  Jewish  immigrant  identity,  claiming  to  be  of  English  background.   Gaenor  “almost  accepts  his  Jewish  identity  more  than  he  accepts  it  himself’,  says  Nia  Roberts,  who  plays  Gaenor.  “It’s  not  like  one  is  shown  as  a  victim  and  the  other  is  not.  That’s  one  of  the  things  I  like  about  this  film.”   In  addition  to  Solomon  and  Gaenor’s  religious   struggles,  class  and  gender  weigh  heavily  on  the  film.  For  Gaenor’s  brother  Crad  —  a  poorly  edu  cated,  physical  man  who  is  willing  to  use  vio  lence  to  protect  Gaenor  —  Solomon  is  an  out  sider  even  as  an  Englishman  who  doesn’t  work   in  the  mines.   “In  North  London,  it’s  experienced  as  a  Jewish  film.  In  Wales,  it’s  experienced  as  a  Welsh  film,”  says  Morrison,  who  is  also  a  trained  psy  chotherapist.   The  film  features  dialogue  in  Welsh,  English  and  Yiddish.  Since  David  Horovitch,  who  plays  Solomon’s  father,  was  the  only  actor  who  knew  Yiddish,  an  instructor  was  brought  in  to  coach  the  cast  on  its  Yiddish  lines.  Veteran  British  Jewish  actress  Maureen  Lipman,  who  plays  Solomon’s  mother,  had  the  most  difficult  time  learning  Yiddish.  In  fact,  Lipman  nearly  walked  out  on  the  project  at  one  point  out  of  frustration  at  learning  the  Yiddish  lines.  “We  had  to  beg  her  to  stay,”  says  Morrison.   Ironically,  Gruffudd,  who  is  not  Jewish,  had  the  easiest  time  learning  Yiddish  —  perhaps  because  he  grew  up  bilingual  and  because  Welsh  and  Yiddish  both  contain  guttural   sounds.   The  culture  clashes  that  figure  heavily  in  this  film  have  also  shaped  Morrison’s  life.  The  50ish  Morrison  grew  up  in  the  Jewish  area  of  North  London.  His  grandparents  were  anarchists  and  his  parents  founded  a  Reform  community.  Like  many  members  of  his  generation,  Morrison  took  a  circuitous  path  to  his  Judaism.  In  his  universi  ty  days,  he  became  involved  himself  in  leftist  politics,  and  perhaps  as  a  result  of  what  he  calls  the  British  pressure  not  to  be  “too  Jewish”,  he  dabbled  in  Eastern  religions.  He  quickly  learned,  he  says,  that  “that  wasn’t  my  language”  and   returned  to  Judaism.   The  longtime  documentary  film-maker  then  decided  to  apply  his  Jewish  reawakening  to  his  work  as  well.  “I  reached  a  point  where  I  realised  that  I  had  never  really  honoured  my  Jewish  upbringing  in  my  film-making,”  adding  that  the  Jewish  experience  in  Britain  has  rarely  been  por  trayed  on  screen.  He  made  a  series  of  documen  taries  on  British  Jewish  identity  that  aired  on  British  television  before  he  made  Solomon  and  Gaenor—  his  first  non-documentary.   Scene  from  Solomon  and  Gaenor.   Jewish  symbolism  suffuses  the  film.  The  scenes  of  the  riot,  in  which  unemployed  miners  smash  a  Jewish  store  run  by  Solomon’s  family,  are  reminiscent  of  the  1938  Kristallnacht  pogrom,  when  Jewish  homes  and  shops  were  attacked  throughout  Germany  and  Austria.   When  Solomon  goes  to  meet  Gaenor,  he  hides  his  tallit  in  a  stone  wall.  On  one  such  occasion,  his  brother  spies  him  hiding  the  ritual  cloth  and  places  it  under  his  pillow.  Later,  the  tallit  shields  Solomon  as  he  fights  the  harshly  beautiful  ele  ments  of  the  Welsh  landscape  in  a  biblical-like   search  for  Gaenor.   As  Morrison  jokes,  “someone  said  ‘this  is  a  film  about  1001  uses  for  a  tallis  More  seriously,  he  says,  “for  a  Jewish  man,  it  is  a  very  powerful  symbol.”   It’s  a  story  that  Morrison  believes  has  a  uni  versal  appeal  on  a  personal  level  today  as  well.  “I  feel  that  something  people  are  grappling  with  is  how  can  I  be  with  someone  and  not  try  to  change  them.”   Morrison  has  faced  this  challenge  in  his  own  life.  His  wife  is  not  Jewish  —  but  he  says  their  relationship  was  never  infused  with  the  difficul  ties  faced  by  his  film’s  heroes.  He  and  his  wife  are  raising  their  three  children  as  Jews,  and  his  parents  accepted  the  marriage  with  little  diffi  culty.  “They  were  just  happy  I  was  getting  mar  ried,”  he  says.   Morrison  cautions  against  drawing  too  many  links  between  his  life  and  the  film,  but  admits  that  he  was  moved  that  because  of  the  rainy  Welsh  weather,  the  crew  shot  the  scenes  of  Solomon  and  Gaenor’s  wedding  on  his  own  wed  ding  anniversary.  “It  was  very  poignant.  Those  scenes  are  some  of  my  favourite  scenes  in  the   film.”   (The  other  nominees  for  the  Best  Foreign  Film  Oscar  are  Spain’s  All  About  My  Mother,  the  Nepalese  Caravan,  France’s  East-West  and  Under  the  Sun  from  Sweden.)

"  Edited  by  Peter  Scott  Email:  peteyegeottcom.wowiau8a.com   Awkward,  but  a  lot  of  fun,  says  Jewish  player  in  Christian  team   Peter  Scott   BEING  the  only  Jew  in  a  party  of  dozens  of  Christian  basketball  and  volleyball  players  on  tour  of  Australia,  is  a  little  awkward  at  times,  but  the  games  are  fun.   inis  is  tne  juagement  or  ju-year-oia  marcus   Berley,  who  is  part  of  the  2000  touring  party  of  Northwest  Camps  (NBC).  Based  in  Washington  State,  it  is  one  of  America’s  largest  such  organi  sations,  with  more  than  8000  boys  and  girls  attending  its  30-plus  camps  in  three  countries  each  year—and  it  is  soon  to  expand  to  Australia.   “It’s  kind  of  awkward  [to  be  an  NBC  tourist]  and  I  was  worried  that  I  would  feel  a  little  uncom   ^  fortable  when  prayers  were  said,”  Berley  con   fessed  in  Sydney  last  week.  But  many  of  his  mis  givings,  if  not  his  scepticism,  disappeared  almost  as  soon  as  the  tour  got  underway.   With  a  religious  presentation  part  and  parcel  of  each  of  NBC’s  tour  spots  —  featuring  a  few  songs  and  some  personal  comments  from  the  high  school-age  youngsters  and  coaches  making  up  the  party  —  it  came  as  a  surprise  to  Berley  that   he  was  voted  by  his  peers  to  be  the  first  speaker   on  tour.   So,  between  games  against  Redfem  PCYC  at  Sydney  University’s  Sports  Centre,  he  explained  that  given  that  he  is  Jewish,  he  does  not  have  “a  personal  relationship  with  Jesus  Christ”.  Nevertheless,  that  doesn’t  mean  that  he  is  unap  preciative  of  NBC’s  ethical  and  behavioural  mes   sages.   And  how  did  a  Jewish  boy  end  up  in  a  Christian  sports  camp,  followed  by  a  tour  to  Australia?  He  went  to  NBC  camps  because  some  of  his  best  friends  did.  “On  balance  I’m  having  a  great  time;  1  love  the  basketball  and  the  compa  ny.”   What  he  did  baulk  at  a  little  was  the  rigid  regi  men  of  tour  duties,  such  as  keeping  a  daily  jour  nal,  finding  its  lack  of  spontaneity—“you  have  to  do  it”—a  bit  too  restrictive.  “I  doubt  that  anyone  will  come  away  more  religious  because  of  it,”  he   said.   An  iconoclastic  character,  Berley  is  the  classic  questioning  type.  He  is  unabashed  in  claiming  that  Judaism’s  practice  is  more  questioning  in  its   outlook  than  Christianity—at  least  in  its  Ketorm  and  Conservative  streams.   A  student  at  Seattle’s  Garfield  Public  High  School,  he  loves  public  speaking  and  is  an  active  participant  in  the  school’s  sporting  culture,  per  forming  best  in  basketball  and  tennis.  But  this  is  about  to  come  to  an  end,  as  he  contemplates  the  choice  of  college  courses  for  next  September  and  life  beyond  the  cosy  world  of  teenage  schooling.   The  tour  to  Australia  with  NBC  is  likely  to  be  his  sporting  swan-song,  and  he  is  now  concen  trating  on  other  matters,  including  his  Jewishness  in  the  wake  of  a  study  tour  to  Israel  earlier  this  year,  which  he  described  as  “an  incredible  experience”.   He  is  also  interested  in  participating  in  the  Maccabiah  Games  sometime  in  the  future.  But  knowing  Maccabi  politics  around  the  world,  it  did  not  come  as  a  surprise  that  neither  he,  nor  any  of  his  Jewish  sporting  friends,  have  even  the  slightest  inkling  of  what  happened  to  the  Australian  and  Austrian  athletes  on  the  Yarkon  River  bridge  three  years  ago.   USA  Maccabi  cannot  be  said  to  have  indulged   Marcus  Barley  works  the  crowd  at  an  NBC  game  in  Sydney.   in  a  campaign  of  information  of  any  consequence  for  its  constituency,  which  should,  one  supposes,  be  kept  in  mind  whenever  they  do  claim  to  speak  on  behalf  of  the  American  Jewish  sporting  com  munity.   In  the  meantime,  though,  Marcus  Berley  is  busy  in  Australia  doing  what  he  likes  best  —  scoring  points  and  running  plays  from  his  point  guard’s  position  on  a  basketball  court,  where  religious  beliefs  don’t  matter  in  the  least.   What  does  matter  is  how  good  you  are  —  and  having  seen  this  178cm  youngster  in  action,  it  is  safe  to  state  that  he  is  very,  very  good  indeed. ",2000-07-14
"  Michael  J  Jordan   NEW  YORK:  Jews  are  voicing  mixed  reaction  to  the  European  Union’s  move  to  lift  sanctions  it  had  imposed  on  Austria  after  the  extremist  Freedom  Party  joined  the  country’s  government.   The  14-member  EU  imposed  the  sanctions  in  February,  three  months  after  the  Freedom  Party  —led  by  the  charismatic  Jorg  Haider—had  won  27  percent  of  the  vote.  Haider  routinely  spoke  of  “Austria  for  real  Austrians”  and  had  made  public  statements  sympathetic  to  Nazi  Germany.   The  EU’s  modest,  mostly  symbolic  sanctions,  said  European  leaders,  were  a  defence  of  “European  values”  and  stemmed  from  concern  that  the  Freedom  Party’s  ascendancy  would  feed  the  far  right  across  the  continent.   But  three  EU  officials  —  known  as  the  “three  wise  men”  —  appointed  to  review  the  situation  in  Austria  had  recently  given  the  thumbs  up,  and  the  end  of  sanctions  was  announced  last  week.   Critics,  though,  see  the  EU’s  decision  as  a  retreat,  saying  the  sanctions  had  provoked  claims  of  hypocrisy,  debate  about  national  sov  ereignty  and  had  fanned  nationalist,  anti-Europe  sentiment  in  several  countries,  like  Denmark.   Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  condemned  the  EU  move,  saying  sanctions  should  remain  in  place  as  long  as  a  party  with  “neo-fascist  trap  pings”  remains  in  the  Austrian  government.  Officials  said  the  Jewish  State  would  continue  to  withhold  its  ambassador  to  Vienna.   Meanwhile,  the  American  Jewish  Committee  will  maintain  its  policy  of  refusing  to  meet  with   Austrian  officials.  “We  cannot  do  business  as  usual  with  Austria  as  long  as  the  Freedom  Party  is  part  of  the  coalition,”  said  Committee  spokesman  Kenneth  Bandler.  “We’re  disappoint  ed  [the  sanctions  were  lifted]  because  we’re  extremely  concerned  about  the  impact  Haider’s  rise  is  having  on  extremist  movements  across  Europe.  Thus,  it  requires  continued  vigilance.”   Bandler  noted  with  approval  a  French  propos  al  to  create  a  monitoring  system  that  would  keep  an  eye  on  Haider’s  influence  in  Austria  and  the  country’s  treatment  of  minorities  and  immi  grants.   Across  the  aisle  is  the  Anti-Defamation  League.  In  February,  the  ADL  stood  alone  among  Jewish  groups  when  it  opposed  the  sanctions,  warning  that  Austria’s  isolation  might  backfire  and  fur   ther  inflame  extremism.   “We  believed  that  diplomatic  and  economic  sanctions  were  not  the  most  constructive  way  to  deal  with  this  phenomenon,”  ADL  national  direc  tor  Abraham  Foxman  reiterated.  “Instead,  ADL   encouraged  grass-roots  engagement  with  the  73  percent  of  the  Austrian  voting  public  who  did   not  vote  for  Mr  Haider.”   The  ADL,  for  example,  has  sponsored  pro  grams  to  make  Austrian  teachers  aware  of  anti  semitism  and  other  forms  of  prejudice.  One  of  the  few  American  Jewish  groups  with  an  office  in  Vienna,  the  ADL  leadership  has  relied  heavily  on  the  insight  of  its  local  analyst.   But  even  among  Austria’s  6500  Jews,  reaction  seems  mixed.  The  president  of  Austria’s  Jewish  community,  Ariel  Muzikant,  agreed  that  sane   Jorg  Haider   tions  had  proven  “counterproductive  .  “Austrians  felt  stigmatised,”  he  said.  On  the  other  hand,  said  Muzikant,  the  sanctions  had  sparked  discussion  about  common  European  values  and  parameters  for  acceptable  political   behaviour.   Moreover,  if  something  were  to  nappen  tomorrow  in  Italy  or  Hungary,  for  example,  now  we  have  a  precedent”  for  European  reaction.   JTA ",2000-09-22
"  Is  saving  the  whales   VIEWPOINT   MARK  JOFFE   WHEN  more  than  200  Jewish  philanthropists  and  communal  professionals  gathered  in  Phoenix,  Arizona,  recently,  they  got  a  challenge  they  might  not  have  expected.   Instead  of  praising  their  work,  one  of  the  first  speakers  to  address  the  10th  national  confer  ence  of  the  Jewish  Funders  Network  questioned  the  priorities  of  the  conference  participants.   Jack  Wertheimer,  provost  of  the  Conservative  movement’s  Jewish  Theological  Seminary,  told  the  group:  “There  are  so  many  causes  support  ed  by  Jews  and  Jewish  organisations  without  thought  or  reference  to  Judaism.  The  question  ‘What  is  a  Jewish  cause?’  needs  to  be  weighed  carefully.”  The  conference  organisers  apparent  ly  agree,  because  they  chose  as  this  year’s  theme  “Saving  the  Whales:  Is  it  Jewish  Funding?”   For  Wertheimer,  the  answer  to  that  question  is  a  resounding  “no”.  He  decried  the  fact  that  many  Jewish  foundations  and  private  benefac  tors  support  non-Jewish  causes,  at  the  expense  of  Jewish  ones,  in  the  pursuit  of  tikkun  olam  (repairing  the  world).  “Increasing  numbers  of  wealthy  Jews  have  decided  that  the  real  needs   lie  elsewhere,”  he  said,  quoting  a  recent  study  which  found  that  70-90  percent  of  the  grants  provided  by  American  Jewish  family  founda  tions  go  to  non-Jewish  causes.  This  is  happen  ing  at  a  time  when  “a  great  many  Jewish  institu  tions  teeter  on  the  brink  of  bankruptcy.  In  the  process  of  gaining  the  world,  we  are  losing  our  selves.  For  those  of  us  concerned  about  the  future  of  the  Jewish  community,  this  is  a  disas   ter.   “70-90  percent  of  the  grants  provided  by  American  Jewish  family   foundations  go  to  non-Jewish  causes.  In  gaining  the  world,   we  are  losing  ourselves.”   “Are  funders  acting  as  responsible  Jews?  I  say  ‘no!’  I  ask  you  to  reconsider  your  priorities,”  he  implored  his  listeners.   His  speech  clearly  rattled  some  of  those  lis  teners,  who  included  a  wide  range  of  fundrais  ers  from  individual  donors  to  representatives  of  large  foundations.  But  those  who  might  have  been  offended  by  Wertheimer’s  remarks  got  some  reassurance  from  the  next  speaker,  Rabbi  David  Saperstein,  director  of  the  Religious  Action  Centre  of  Reform  Judaism.  He  agreed  with  Wertheimer  that  not  enough  Jewish  money  was  going  to  Jewish  causes  —  but  he  passion   ately  defended  the  importance  of  supporting  non-Jewish  causes  as  well.  “Acting  on  universal  concerns  is  in  our  interests,  we  cannot  truly  be  for  ourselves  without  being  for  others,”  he  said.   Moreover,  Rabbi  Saperstein  argued  that  Jewish  fundraisers  do  not  have  to  support  one  at  the  expense  of  the  other.  “I  don’t  believe  it  has  to  be  a  choice,”  he  said.  “We  have  the  wealth,  the  wherewithal  and  the  influence  to  do   both.”   Indeed,  most  of  the  fundraisers  at  the  confer  ence  support  a  vast  array  of  Jewish  causes,  from  a  Yiddish  festival  in  Los  Angeles  to  a  Jewish  dayschool  in  Warsaw.  And  the  conference  itself  was  geared  to  helping  fundraisers  be  responsi  ble  and  effective  in  their  funding  choices.   But  while  many  of  the  sessions  focused  on  supporting  the  types  of  Jewish  causes  that  Wertheimer  feels  need  more  attention,  others  dealt  with  the  more  universal  causes  that  Rabbi  Saperstein  said  deserve  Jewish  support  too.  They  included  a  session  on  “Funding  Advocacy:  Strategies  for  Changing  Public  Policy  on  a  Living   Wage  and  Gun  Control”  and  another  on  “Funding  as  a  Global  Citizen:  Environmental  Challenges  at  Home  and  Abroad”.   Jeffrey  Dekro,  president  of  the  Shefa  Fund,  which  promotes  Jewish  social  responsibility,  argued  that  causes  such  as  these  are,  in  fact,  Jewish  interests,  too.  He  put  it  this  way:  “Is  clean  air  and  clean  water  something  Jews  can   do  without?” ",2000-05-05
"  istic  ethics   IS   THE  Sydney  Beth  Din  (Jewish  Ecclesiastical  Court)  has  issued  a  statement  in  response  to  the  Australian  Jewish  News  ’  coverage  of  the  Mardi  Gras.  The  full  statement  reads  as  follows:   “The  issue  is  not  whether  homo  sexuality  is  approved  or  disap  proved  by  Judaism.  On  this  the  answer  is  that  it  is  prohibited  by  the  Torah,  and  no  Halachic  authority  has  ever  said  otherwise.  The  issue  is  not  whether  there  are  some  Jews   who  follow  a  homosexual  lifestyle.  The  fact  is  that  there  are,  and  no  one  has  the  right  to  persecute  them,  despite  the  fact  that  Judaism  can  not  condone  homosexual  acts.   “The  issue  is  not  whether  the   Mardi  Gras  is  part  of  the  Sydney  scene.  The  answer  is  that  it  seems  to  have  become  so,  despite  its  immodesty  and  vulgarity.   “The  issue  is  how  a  Jewish  news  paper  should  handle  some  Jewish  people’s  participation  in  the  Mardi  Gras.  It  is  thus  a  question  of  Jewish  journalistic  ethics.   “The  fact  is  that  Jewish  newspa  pers  are  often  called  upon  to  exer  cise  responsibility  and  restraint,  and  there  have  been  many  occa  sions  when  the  Jewish  News  has  decided  it  was  better  not  to  publish  something  or  to  publish  it  in  a  limit  ed  way.   “From  that  viewpoint,  syna  gogues,  schools,  communal  and   Beth  Din  Registrar  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple   Zionist  organisations,  welfare  agen  cies  and  cultural  facilities  all  have  an  obvious  place  in  a  Jewish  paper.  All,  in  their  own  way,  promote  Jewish  ideology  and  destiny.  But  that  cannot  be  said  for  an  activity  which  contradicts  an  explicit  teach  ing  of  Torah;  a  Jewish  activity  can  not  be  founded  on  the  rejection  of  a  Jewish  principle.  Further  instead  of  assisting  Jewish  continuity,  it  makes  it  more  difficult,  since  by  definition  it  cannot  create  a  future  generation.  It  has  no  inherently  Jewish  ethos,  ethic  or  ideology.   “A  responsible  Jewish  newspaper  cannot  and  must  not  give  the  impression  that  everything  that  some  Jews  do  is  automatically  a   legitimate  Jewish  activity.  It  is  not  likely  to  want  to  appear  to  favour,  for  example  a  Bondi  Road  parade  of  Jews  who  (if  they  exist)  make  a  point  of  committing  adultery.   “A  Jewish  newspaper  has  to  have  standards,  and  one  of  them  has  to  be  receptivity  and  sensitivity  to  the  voice  of  Torah.”   The  statement  was  signed  by  Beth  Din  dayanim  (judges)  Rabbis  Raymond  Apple,  Selwyn  Franklin,  Moshe  Gutnick,  David  Rogut  and  Yoram  Ulman,  as  well  as  by  Rabbi  Gutnick  in  his  capacity  as  president  of  the  NSW  Rabbinical  Council  and  Rabbi  Selwyn  Franklin  as  president  of  the  Organisation  of  Rabbis  of  Australasia.

"  Can  Jewish  agenda  get  through  lame-duck  Congress?   Shsrosi  Samites*   WASHINGTON:  As  the  106th  Congress  prepares  to  put  the  finishing  touches  on  its  much  maligned  legislative  track  record,  Jewish  groups  are  hoping  that  their  top-agenda  items  will  get  addressed  before  it’s  too  late.   Whether  or  not  the  outgoing  Congress  —  which  faces  criticism  that  it  hasn’t  accomplished  much—will  feel  hard-pressed  to  move  on  issues  such  as  immigration  or  hate  crimes  when  it  reconvenes  on  December  5  depends  on  a  num   ber  of  factors.   Republicans,  who  will  retain  control  of  both  the  Senate  and  the  House  of  Representatives  in  the  next  Congress  as  a  result  of  the  recent  elec  tions,  may  have  little  incentive  to  compromise  with  President  Bill  Clinton’s  outgoing  administra  tion  over  outstanding  legislation.   But  much  still  depends  on  the  outcome  of  the  presidential  race.  If  Texas  Governor  George  W  Bush  wins  the  White  House,  as  is  looking  likely,  Republicans  may  try  harder  to  block  Clinton’s  initiatives  and  hold  off  on  legislative  initiatives  until  Republicans  control  both  Congress  and  the  presidency.   But  if  Democrat  Vice-President  A1  Gore  wins,  it  is  unclear  whether  there  would  be  an  attempt  at  bipartisan  cooperation  or  lingering  animosity  against  Gore  for  the  way  he  achieved  his  victory.   Jewish  organisations,  in  particular,  are  watch  ing  an  immigration  bill  —  one  of  the  issues  hold  ing  up  the  budget,  that  would  restore  certain  benefits  —  including  Medicaid  and  food  stamps   eligibility—taken  away  by  welfare  reform  laws  in   1996.   In  addition,  provisions  of  the  bill,  known  as  the  Latino  and  Immigrant  Fairness  Act,  would  ease  the  process  for  undocumented  immigrants,  including  Jews  from  the  former  Soviet  Union,  who  have  lived  in  the  United  States  for  a  long  time  and  require  permanent  resident  status  to  remain  here  legally.  Clinton  is  pushing  to  grant  a  form  of  amnesty  to  this  group  of  immigrants,  some  of  whom  may  be  illegal,  who  have  lived  in  the  United  States  for  15  years  or  more.   Another  change  would  allow  undocumented  immigrants  who  are  already  in  the  United  States  and  on  the  verge  of  obtaining  a  Green  Card,  or  immigrant  visa  that  allows  legal  employment,  to  obtain  that  visa  in  the  United  States  rather  than  having  to  get  it  in  their  home  country.   With  the  support  of  the  White  House  and  some  key  legislators,  the  law  could  pass,  accord  ing  to  Gideon  Aronoff  of  the  Hebrew  Immigrant  Aid  Society.   Opponents  of  the  immigration  bill  say  it  helps  illegal  immigrants  and  gives  benefits  to  people  instead  of  making  them  take  responsibility  for  themselves.  Aronoff  says  efforts  should  be  spent  on  legalising  people  who  already  live  in  the  United  States,  rather  than  on  spending  resources  to  deport  them.   Another  issue  Jewish  groups  are  hoping  will  get  Congress’  attention  is  hate  crimes  legislation,  which  has  been  strongly  promoted  by  the  Clinton  administration.  The  Senate  passed  hate  crimes  legislation  in  June,  but  despite  support  in   the  House,  the  measure  was  stripped  out  of  a  defence  bill  because  of  objections  from  the  Republican  leadership.   The  controversial  legislation  would  authorise  federal  prosecution  of  crimes  motivated  by  sex  ual  orientation,  gender  or  disability,  expanding  the  current  laws  that  protect  victims  of  crimes  motivated  by  race,  colour,  religion  or  ethnicity.  State  and  local  law  enforcement  would  still  have  primary  responsibility  for  investigating  and  pros  ecuting  hate  crimes.   Groups  like  the  Anti-Defamation  League  see  this  lameduck  session  as  a  chance  for  passing  the  bias  crime  legislation,  especially  if  Clinton  continues  his  support  for  it.  White  House  officials  have  said  they  will  make  a  last  push  to  expand  protections  against  hate-motivated  crimes.   Michael  Lieberman,  Washington  counsel  for  the  ADL,  says  scenarios  for  passage  still  exist  but  that  it’s  an  uphill  battle.   Although  Israel’s  annual  foreign  aid  package  is  set,  the  White  House  sent  a  request  last  week  to  Capitol  Hill  for  additional  aid  to  Israel.  The  Clinton  administration  wants  Congress  to  approve  $US450  million  this  year  to  Israel  for  mil  itary  purposes  and  to  help  defray  the  cost  of  its  withdrawal  from  Lebanon.  The  White  House  also  wants  to  give  an  additional  $US225  million  to  Egypt  and  $US75  million  to  Jordan.   Under  different  circumstances,  the  request  might  have  been  routine,  but  with  politically  volatile  situations  in  Israel  and  the  United  States  and  the  continued  violence  in  the  Middle  East,   the  aid  package  might  get  more  scrutiny.

"  Jewish  connection  continues  in  new   Marian  Street  season   Peter  Morrison   THE  Marian  Street  Theatre  is  not  exactly  positioned  in,  A  nor  does  it  draw  support  heavily  from,  an  area  densely  pop-  ulated  by  Jews.  Yet,  it  has  for  some  years,  under  the  direction  of  John  Krummel,  given  voice  to  more  Jewish  plays,  Jewish  playwrights  and  Jewish  actors  than  could  rea-  sonably  be  expected.   I  have  not  asked  Krummel  why  because  he  is  a  liberal-minded  man  of  the  theatre,  with  abiding  princi-  pals  and  clear,  realistic  judgement.  He  would  undoubtedly  say  he  puts  together  each  year  the  best  avail-  able  and  affordable  plays,  which  in  his  judgement  are  likely  to  keep  the  sometimes  precariously  poised  Marian  afloat.  If  there  are  Jewish  themes  and  other  areas  of  communal  interest,  that’s  fine.   In  the  season  just  ending  with  Barry  Creyton’s  Later  Than  Spring  (highly  recommended  by  this  reviewer)  there  were,  for  example,  Old  Wicked  Songs  and  Neil  Simon’s  Broadway  Bound.   Krummel’s  summer  2000/01  sub-  scription  series,  just  launched,  doesn’t  exactly  sparkle  with   Jewishness,  but  two  of  the  five  plays  are  by  Jewish  writers:  Quartet  by  Ronald  Harwood  of  The  Dresser  and  Taking  Sides  fame,  and  the  2000  Pulitzer  Prize  winner,  Donald  Margulies’  Dinner  with  Friends.  Margulies  —  like  Harwood  —  is  no  stranger  to  the  Marian.  His  Collected  Stories,  starring  Ruth  Cracknell,  has  only  just  finished  its  Killara  run  and  is  on  tour  to  the  Sydney  Theatre  Company,  which  co-produced  it.   It  is  also  gratifying  to  note  that  Jewish  actor  (and  let’s  face  it,  there  are  not  too  many  of  the  breed  in  mainstream  Australian  theatre)  Percy  Sieff  will  star  along-  side  June  Salter  and  Sheila  Bradley  in  Harwood’s  Quartet.  The  play  tells  the  story  of  three  once  famous,  now  retired  musicians  and  what  happens  when  someone  comes  along  to  shatter  their  tran-  quillity.   Other  well  known  and  popular  actors  to  appear  in  the  summer  season  include  Maggie  Kirkpatrick,  Michelle  Doake,  Ron  Haddrick,  Noeline  Brown,  Andrew  McFarlane,  Tracy  Mann,  Glenda  Linscott,  David  Downer,  Kerry   Percy  Sieff  as  Mark  Twain  in  The  Lookout  Theatre’s  production  of  Sincerely  Yours,   Mark  Twain  in  1995.  Photo:  Corrie  Ancone   McGuire  (too  long  absent  from  the  Marian  stage)  and  Fay  Kelton.   Krummel,  who  alas  is  not  acting  these  days  following  a  stroke,  is  as  dynamic  and  stagewise  as  ever,   and  will  direct  three  of  the  five   plays:  Alan  Plater’s  Peggy  for  You,  A  R  Gurney’s  Labor  Day  (a  sequel  to  The  Cocktail  Hour)  and  Alan  Bennett’s  Single  Spies,  which  is  a  bill  of  two  plays,  An  Englishman   Abroad  and  A  Question  of  Attrition.  Bennett  wrote  a  recent  Marian  hit,  Talking  Heads.   And  mazal  tov  to  Graham  McLean,  who  has  been  appointed  resident  designer,  following  his  brilliant  work  on  many  Marian  pro-  ductions,  recently  including  Letter  of  Resignation,  Old  Wicked  Songs,  Broadway  Bound  and  Later  Than  Spring.

"  Title:  Coming  Out  Jewish:   Constructing   Ambivalent  Identities   Author:  Jon  Stratton   Publisher.  Routledge,  351pp,  $38.95   Reviewer:  Ben  Haneman   HAT  is  it  that  identifies  us  as  being  Jewish?  This  might  seem  an  easy  ¥  ¥  question  to  answer,  but  imagine  if  not  all  our  family  members  are  Jewish,  or  we  are  irreligious,  or  even  have  a  deep  desire  not   to  be  Jewish  at  all.   Jon  Stratton  is  Professor  of  Cultural  Studies  at  Curtin  University  of  Technology,  Perth.  His  own  ambiguous  Jewish  background  in  part  explains  his  need  to  clarify  the  topic.  His  book   is  suitable  for  anyone  who  is  prepared  to  per  sist  with  a  scholarly,  often  dense  and  discur  sive  monograph.   It  would  be  more  charitable  to  describe  it  as   multi-layered,  challenging,  relevant,  timely  and  instructive.  Socratic  and  didactic,  it  is  very  much  adult  reading,  dealing  with,  for  instance,  fear  of  castration  and  penis  envy,  “Making  social  space  for  Jews  in  America”  and  “Seinfield  is  a  Jewish  sitcom,  isn’t  it?”  In  a  way,  this  collection  of  essays  is  a  menu,  rather  than   a  meal.   Stratton  asks  all  the  right  questions,  but  leaves  us  the  task  of  finding  the  right  answers.  He  is  brilliant  when  it  comes  to  explaining  why   Jews  are  not  unanimous  about  what  it  is  to  be  Jewish.   Australian  Jewry  finds  a  place  in  the  Ethnic  Communities  Council,  for  example,  and  cer  tainly  makes  use  of  communal  options  avail  able  in  multi-ethnic,  multicultural  Australia.  He  believes  that  government-sponsored  multi   culturalism  is  due  to  the  realisation  that  assimilation  has  failed  in  Australia.  The  undis  closed  model  for  the  original,  classic,  most  desired  ethnicity/culture  was  the  Anglo-Celtic,   and  Australia  would  like  to  “tame”  and  “house  train”  multiculturalism  or  ethnicity.   Where  does  Australian  Jewry  lie  in  this  con  ceptual  ethnicity  spectrum?  For  many  Australians,  certainly  older  Australians,  the  ideal  ethnicity  is  a  question  of  costumes,  cus  toms  and  cooking,  but  not  much  more;  do  that  by  all  means,  but  then  get  on  with  the  nation  al  task  of  assimilation!   Stratton  writes  about  our  ghetto  mentality.  The  original  Australian  “indigenous”  Jews  wanted  more  than  anything  to  be  invisible  British  citizens  of  the  Mosaic  persuasion.  But  being  invisible  didn’t  necessitate  being  assim   ilated.  Nevertheless,  they  were  put  out  when  very  visible  Jews  arrived,  foreigners  to  boot.  It  has  been  said  that  Australian  Jewry  was  keen  for  Jewish  refugees  to  go  to  Israel,  rather  than  come  here.  Stratton  documents  a  revealing  disparity  between  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  and  its  Victorian  counterpart.  When  membership  of  the  Ethnic  Communities  Council  was  offered,  Melbourne  Jewry  jumped  at  it,  while  the  more  Anglo-dominated  NSW  community  first  ruled  against  such  involve   ment.   Is  Yiddishkeit  the  defining  link  that  binds  all  Jews?  If  so,  what  is  meant  by  Yiddishkeit  The  term  has  been  used  to  include  Jewish  religion,  customs  and  observance.  But  there  is  more  to  Yiddishkeit  and  also  less.  Stratton  suggests  that  one  feature  that  marks  all  Jews  today  is  recollection  of  the  Shoah.  He  might  be  right.  Attachment  to  Israel?  Less  so;  not  all  Jews  feel  comfortable  about  developments  in  Israel.  Even  if  we  use  religion  as  the  distinguishing  criterion,  look  how  many  forms  there  are,  and  all  of  them  equally  valid.  What  about  Jews  who  would  discard  religion,  but  believe  that  living  honestly,  upholding  justice  and  kind  ness  are  the  true  hallmarks  of  being  Jewish?  Stratton’s  final  challenge  is  in  the  matter  of  continuity.  We  all  pay  lip-service  to  Jewish  continuity.  But  what  is  it,  precisely,  that  we  want  continued?   Well  referenced  and  indexed,  this  serious  book  should  be  read  and  discussed  widely  because  it  is  extremely  relevant  to  where  our  community  stands  today.  It  also  provides  a  useful  background  to  understanding  the  com  munal  jousts  which  constantly  occur.   Dr  Ben  Haneman  is  a  consultant  physician  and  book  reviewer. ",2000-09-08

If  the  latter,  why  is  A1  Gore  bothering  to  woo  it?  And  has  George  W  Bush  any  hope  of  winning  more  of  it?   Let’s  at  least  begin  with  some  answers  to  other  questions,  such  as  why  it  matters.  Come  the  November  election  for  the  next  President  of  the  United  States,  bar  ring  the  unforseen,  it’ll  be  Gore  for  the  Democrats  and  Bush  for  the  Republicans.

The  temptation  in  the  CNN  age  is  to  go  along  with  such  media  generated  cynicism  and  view  the  campaign  which  lies  ahead  as  the  21st  century’s  version  of  the  Theatre  of  the  Absurd.  Full  of  sound  and  fury  signifying,  well,  very  little  indeed.   This  is  an  understandable  reac  tion,  but  it  would  be  a  mistaken  one.  The  process  of  choosing  the  man  who  could  be  sitting  in  the  White  House  for  the  next  eight  years  may  be  flawed,  even  hope  lessly  so.  But  it  matters,  and  the  result  matters.  To  Americans  cer  tainly,  and,  given  that  they’re  the  world’s  only  superpower,  to  the   rest  of  us.   My  narrower  argument  is  that  the  US  presidential  campaign  and  its  outcome  is,  or  should  be,  of  some  special  interest  to  Jews  and  the  Jewish  world.  Which  is  why,  over  the  months  ahead,  this  col  umn,  from  time  to  time,  will  com  ment  on  the  campaign  and  try  to  make  sense  of  what  the  race  for  the  White  House  means.  Today,  I’ll  try  to  set  the  scene.   Jews  everywhere  outside  the  United  States  share  a  stake  in  the  result,  not  only  because  the  next  American  President,  like  all  his  predecessors  for  the  past  52  years,  will  play  a  significant  role  in  helping  to  shape  Israel’s  security  and  economic  future,  but  also  because  his  domestic  policies  will  affect  American  Jewry.   Despite  its  vital  role  in  contemporary  Jewish  history...  American  Jewry  remains  surprisingly  unknown  to  the   rest  of  World  Jewry,  largely  misunderstood   and  badly  under-reported.   This  latter  impact  counts  because  what  happens  in  American  Jewish  life  counts.  To  Israel  and  the  Jewish  world.  For  amidst  all  the  doomsayer  predic  tions  about  the  disappearing  American  Jew,  it’s  easy  to  forget  that  the  Americans  still  make  up   the  largest,  most  influential,  most  affluent,  most  educated  and  most  creatively  Jewish  of  Diaspora  communities.  By  a  factor  of  many  multiples.   Yet  despite  its  vital  and  continu  ing  role  in  contemporary  Jewish  history  —  even  if  that  role  has  passed  its  zenith  since  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  and  the  beginning  of  Oslo  —  American  Jewry  remains  surprisingly  unknown  to  the  rest  of  World  Jewry,  largely  misunder  stood  and  badly  under-reported.   True,  as  a  sovereign  Jewish  State  so  long  embattled,  Israel  was  bound  to  attract  more  attention.  Now,  too,  it’s  become  the  Jewish  world’s  main  centre  of  gravity,  demographically,  politically,  cul  turally  etc,  and  American  Jewry   can’t  match  that.  But  at  the  same  time,  the  sovereign  state  cannot  go  it  alone  Jewishly,  or  take  the  rest  of  the  Jewish  world  along  with  it,  unless  the  American  Jews  are  part  of  the  journey.   Hence  the  importance  of  the  political  culture  which  lies  at  the  heart  of  American  society  and  American  Jewish  life.  Consider  some  basic  facts.  Some  three  mil   lion  American  Jews  will  vote  in  the  November  election,  not  only  for  President,  of  course,  but  also  for  all  of  the  435  seats  in  the  House  of  Representatives  and  one  third  of  those  in  the  Senate.   The  great  majority  of  those  votes  will  be  cast  in  the  big  elec   toral  states  —  such  as  New  York  and  California  —  where  the  elec  tion  may  well  be  decided.  Moreover,  in  a  system  where  vot  ing  is  not  compulsory,  the  Jewish  turnout  can  be  as  high  as  80  per  cent,  much  higher  than  the  aver  age  50  percent.  Jews  are  dispro  portionately  represented  amongst  the  campaign  advisers,  managers,  fundraisers,  donors,  although  more  Jews  have  been  active  amongst  the  Democrats,  just  as  very  much  more  have  voted  for  the  Democrat  candidate.  Thus  in  1992  and  1996,  some  80  percent   voted  for  Bill  Clinton.   Although  the  JTA  report  quoted  at  the  top  of  this  column  refers  to   the  Jewish  vote”,  I  prefer  instead   to  refer  to  “Jewish  voters”.  Firstly,  this  is  because  American  Jews  range  all  the  way  from  those  for  whom  specifically  Jewish  issues  determine  their  voting  behaviour  to  those  for  whom  these  issues  don’t  matter.   And  secondly,  even  amongst  those  who  consider  Jewish  issues  as  uppermost,  there  are  basic  dif  ferences  eg  Orthodox  Jews  in  Crown  Heights,  New  York,  will  have  differing,  even  opposing,  interests  and  agendas  (and  may  lean  Republican)  to  liberal  Jews  in  Manhattan,  New  York  (who  over  whelmingly  will  be  Democrats).   In  next  week’s  column,  what  the  “Jewish  issues”  are  and  what  they  mean  for  Gore  and  Bush. ",2000-03-17
"  My  favourite  Jewish  things   JOSEPH  AARON   WITH  apologies  to  The  Sound  of  Music,  these  are  a  few  of  my  favourite  Jewish  things:   Potato  kugel.   Taking  a  spiritual  inventory  dur  ing  the  High  Holidays,  secure  in  the  belief  that  God  will  accept  my  atonement  and  give  me  the  chance  to  do  better  in  the  coming  year.   Kuelling  when  a  prominent  Jew  does  something  to  bring  pride  to  the  Jewish  people.   Latkes.   The  movie  Frisco  Kid.   Long  winter  Friday  nights.   Jewish  organisations  that  truly  make  the  lives  of  Jews  better.   Hamantaschen.   The  courage  and  vision  of   Yitzhak  Rabin.   Feeling  an  instant  connection  when  I  run  into  a  fellow  Jew,  no  mat  ter  where  I  see  him,  even  if  far  from  home.  Especially  if  far  from  home.   Pirkei  Avot.   The  incredibly  astute  and  wise  sayings  of  Reb  Nachman  of  Bratzlav,  who,  in  a  few  sentences,  teaches  more  about  living  life,  living  Jewish  life  in  the  real  world  than  anyone   I’ve  ever  encountered.   A  history  full  of  people  who  have  contributed  so  much  to  the  world  in  so  many  ways.   The  loving  concern  the  Lubavitcher  Rebbe  had  for  each  and  every  Jew  and  the  way  he  put  that  into  action  all  around  the  world.   The  Israeli  flag.  I  get  chills  every   time  I  see  it.   Lighting  Chanukah  candles.   Yom  HaShoah  and  Yom  Hazikaron  in  Israel.  Having  an  entire  country  come  to  a  stop  for   two  minutes  to  remember  those  who  were  murdered  in  the  Holocaust  and  to  honour  those  who  died  defending  and  fighting  for  Israel  is  an  experience  unlike  any  other,  is  to  feel  bathed  with  a  Jewish  sensibility  and  to  encapsu  late  so  much  of  who  and  what  we   are.   Jewish  meetings  at  which  a  good  topic  gets  knocked  around  with  all  kinds  of  interesting  insights  and  feelings  coming  from  all  kinds   of  directions.   Staying  up  all  night  the  first  night  of  Shavuot.   Just  about  any  TV  show  with  an  identifiably  Jewish  character.   Chicken  soup.  Go  ahead,  make  jokes,  but  I  love  the  stuff,  can’t  get  enough.  As  long  as  it’s  been  made  by  my  mother.   The  faces  of  young  Jewish  chil   dren.   The  faces  of  bubbies  and  zay   dies.   Feeling  that  God  is  always  with  me,  loves  me,  wants  only  good  for  me,  silently  guides  my  life.   Meeting  Jews  in  another  coun  try.   Rabbis  who  act  like  rabbis.  1  can’t  define  what  that  means,  but  I  know  it  when  I  see  it.   Prayers  set  to  music,  as  long  as  it’s  got  an  uplifting,  spirited  beat.   Watching  Jews  attack  a  kiddush  table.   Jewish  athletes.   The  movie  Schindler’s  List.   Praying  with  concentration.  It  doesn’t  happen  very  often  but  when  it  does,  it’s  sublime.   Saying  psalms  in  English  so  I  know  what  I’m  saying.   Going  to  Reform  and  Conservative  shules  and  seeing  how  much  alike  they  are  to  the  Orthodox  shules  1  grew  up  in  and  seeing  how  much  being  Jewish  is  being  Jewish  no  matter  what  Jewish  team  you  affiliate  yourself   with.   Walking  in  Jerusalem.   Jews  who  take  the  phrase  “all  Jews  are  responsible  one  for  the  other”  seriously  and  actually  put  it  into  action.  They  are  very  precious   souls.   Gathering  all  the  Mishloach  Manot  received  on  Purim  and  pick  ing  out  all  the  yummy  stuff  to  eat.   Sephardi  Jews.  Their  love  of  life,  their  faith  in  God,  their  acceptance  of  all  Jews,  their  spirited  ways,  their  good  common  sense,  show  us  how  Jews  are  supposed  to  be.   Jews  who  take  the  notion  of  Bikur  Cholim  (visiting  the  sick)  seri  ously  and  actually  do  it.  I  can  think  of  few  greater  mitzvot.   The  sound  of  the  breaking  of  the  glass  at  a  wedding.  The  final  shofar  blast  on  Yom  Kippur.   Kissing  the  stones  of  the  Kotel.   Watching  a  barmitzvah  boy  or  batmitzvah  girl  who  doesn’t  see  the  ceremony  as  their  graduation  from  Jewish  life.   Knishes.  Potato  or  meat.  Not  spinach.   A  beautiful  ketubah.  The  movie  Exodus  Jewish  calendars.   Funny  Jewish  jokes.   Talking  to  involved  Jewish   teens  about  the  Jewish  future.   Challah.   Saying  kaddish  on  my  father’s  yahrzeit.   Woody  Allen.   Talking  to  God.   Saying  “Good  Shabbos”  to  co  workers  as  we  all  leave  the  office  on  Friday  afternoon.   Saying  “see  you  next  year”  on  leaving  the  office  for  Rosh  Hashanah.  Yes,  it  still  cracks  me  up.   Seeing  former  enemies  of  Israel  become  our  friends.  Seeing  peace   come  closer  and  closer.   Jewish  summer  camps.   Jews  who  respect  Jews  who  are   not  like  them.   Horseradish.  Funny  thing  is  I  never  used  to  like  it,  but  now  I  do.  I  think  the  fact  that  there’s  a  sweet  ened  version  has  a  lot  to  do  with  that.   My  parents’  stories  of  life  in  the  old  country.   Chuppahs.   Checking  out  new  kosher   restaurants.   The  shamas,  the  guy  in  shuie  who  really  knows  what’s  going  on  and  who  really  runs  things.   Honey  cake.   Not  only  the  diary  of,  but  the  story  and  life  of,  Anne  Frank.   Falafel,  but  only  in  Israel.   A  heartfelt,  personal  eulogy  that  captures  the  essence  of  the  departed.  Kids  who  know  the  answers  at  the  Seder.   Kishke.  Preferably  swimming  in   gravy.   A  mensch.   Teachers  in  any  kind  of  Jewish  school.  The  way  they  are  treated,  the  way  they  are  paid,  is  the  com  munity’s  greatest  disgrace.   The  smell  of  a  fresh  etrog.   Saving  etrogim  from  year  to  year  until  you  have  a  sizeable  col  lection  of  shriveled-up,  discoloured  etrogim.   Jews  who  really  care  about  being  Jewish.   The  first  bite  of  chametz  after  Passover.   The  large  number  of  references  to  things  Jewish  found  each  week  in  Time  and  Newsweek.   The  large  number  of  words  like  shlep  and  kvetch  that  you  hear  on  late-night  TV  talk  shows.   Spinning  a  dreidel.  Not  playing  dreidel,  which  to  this  day  I  don’t  know  how  to  do,  but  1  do  know  how  to  spin  a  dreidel  and  I  frankly  enjoy  doing  so  over  and  over.   Anything  chocolate  shaped  like  any  Jewish  symbol.   A  farbrengen.  If  you  don’t  know  what  that  is,  call  your  nearest  Lubavitch  Chabad  House  and  ask  them  to  invite  you  to  their  next  one.   Hearing  American  songs  sung  with  Yiddish  words.  1  could  listen  to  the  Yiddish  version  of  “Fiddler  on  the  Roof”  for  hours  on  end.

"  The  Jewish  obsession   HOW   DARE  YOU  CALL  ME  NEUROTIC   MOYA  SIMONS   EVER  since  the  Jews  spent  40  years  in  the  desert  living  on  manna,  we  have  been  preoccupied  with  food.   While  Arabs  were  busy  settling  in  oil-rich  lands  we,  rubbing  our  stom  achs,  were  busy  searching  for  the  Land  of  Milk  and  Honey.   It  is  over  3000  years  since  the  Exodus  from  Egypt.  And  we  all  know  that  we  left  in  such  a  hurry,  there  was   When  we  first  celebrated  Passover,  the  Egyptians   celebrated  too.  It  was  the  relief  because  we’d  left.  The  aroma  of  our  baking  was  interfering  with  the  building  of   the  pyramids.   no  time  to  finish  baking  our  bread.  Of  course,  we  did  very  well.  We  escaped  slavery.  And  we  remember  this  with  joy  at  Passover  each  year.  We  also  recall  the  incredible  catastrophe  of  leaving  Egypt  before  our  bread  was  baked  by  eating  matzah  diligently  for  eight  days.  Never  mind  that  we  are  all   constipated  at  the  end  of  the  eight  days.  Bunged  bowels  are  a  small  price  to  pay  for  honouring  the  memory  of   our  unrisen  bread.   Thus,  it  came  to  pass,  that  after  our  Exodus  to  the  Land  of  Israel,  we  moved  onward  to  chicken  soup,  gefilte  fish  and  potato  latkes  (and  the  rest  is  history).   Now,  while  it  is  true  that  not  all  Jews  are  obsessed  with  food,  it  is  fair  to  say  a  lot  of  us  are.  (I,  for  instance,  don’t  really  qualify  because  I  am  a  picky  obsessor.  I  only  obsess  over  chocolate.  And  peanuts.  Marshmallows  perhaps.  Maybe  a  jellybean  or  two).   Gentiles  have  a  fond  fascination  for  Jewish  food.  Take  my  friend,   Christine.  She  occasionally  comes  with  my  children  and  me  to  visit  my  mother  for  dinner.  Christine  fasts  all  day  in  preparation  for  the  event,  by  which  time  her  stomach  sounds  like  the  whine  of  a  fire  engine.   “You  are  a  weeny  sparrow,”  my  mother  tells  her.  “Oy,  your  legs  are  like   sticks  and  your  arms  like  tiny  twigs.”   Lashings  of  gefilte  fish,  chopped  liver,  roast  chicken  and  baked  pota  toes  are  given  to  my  friend,  who  says  the  meal  sure  beats  the  family  barbie.   Christine  is  fascinated  by  the  range  of  topics  we  discuss  over  dinner.  Jews  are,  she  says,  a  very  politically   attuned  lot.   “Does  anyone  know  if  the  GST  is  going  to  affect  challah?  I’m  very  wor  ried,”  Mum  says  as  she  frowns  at  the  peas  I  have  left  on  my  plate.   “I  once  went  to  Pauline  Hanson’s  fish  ‘n’  chip  shop.  I  don’t  like  her  poli  tics,  but  her  fish  was  excellent,”  says  my  daughter,  throwing  a  potato  in  my  direction.  (She  misses.  It  lands  on  her  sister’s  face.  She  extends  her  lizard  long  tongue  and  the  splattered  potato  immediately  disappears  inside  her  mouth).   Have  you  ever  really  listened  to  the  way  we  Jews  discuss  weddings  and  barmitzvahs?   “I  went  to  Hetty’s  son’s  barmitzvah.  What  a  feast!  The  food  was  out  of  this  world.  1  salivate  just  thinking  about  the  chopped  liver.  The  dessert  looked  like  it  had  been  made  by  the  same  guy  who  designed  the  Opera  House.  Oh  yes,  and  the  boy,  what’s  his  name  again,  read  his  portion  of  the  Torah  very  nicely.”   Or,  “Hetty’s  daughter  got  married.  Those  caterers  should  be  jailed  for   what  they  did.  They  gave  my  Moshe  vegetarian  food.  Moshe,  who  needs  meat  because  he’s  still  growing.  Okay,  so  he’s  47.  And  the  dessert.  May  I  be  struck  by  lightning  if  I’m  not  telling  the  absolute  truth.  The  dessert  resem  bled  runny  eggs.  Boy,  did  my  stomach  suffer.  Oh  yes,  and  the  married  couple  looked  reasonably  cute,  though  the  bride  was  too  skinny.”   Jewish  children  go  through  a  diffi  cult  time.  My  earliest  memory  is  of  having  my  bottom  pinched.  It  hurt.  “Don’t  complain,”  said  my  mother.  “I’m  just  assessing  the  fat  content  of  your  tochus.  If  it  hurts,  it  means  there  isn’t  enough.  Tell  me,  would  it  upset  you  to  please  your  poor  mother  and   eat  a  little  more?  Would  that  be  too  much  to  ask?”  My  mother’s  eyes  swelled  with  tears  as  she  said  this,   spoon  in  hand.   There’s  a  rumour  going  around.  That  when  we  first  celebrated  Passover,  the  Egyptians  celebrated  too.  It  was  the  relief  because  we’d  finally  left.  It  was  our  cooking,  you  see.  The  aroma  of  our  baking  was  disturb  ing  them,  thus  interfering  with  the  building  of  the  pyramids.   It’s  wonderful  to  think  I’m  different.  Assimilated,  well-balanced  and  not  prone  to  thinking  obsessively  about  food.  Now  I’ll  just  sit  and  meditate  and  contemplate  my  bagel.   H  Moya  Simons  is  a  Sydney  writer.

"  Estimating  the  size  of  the  Jewish  community   FILE   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   EVERY  five  years,  Australia  holds  a  national  Census.  The  next  snapshot  of  the  Australian  population  —  the  14th  since  1911  —  will  be  taken  on  August  7  next  year.   No  doubt,  as  in  the  past,  many  Jewish  people  will  worry  whether  or  not  they  should  reveal  their  religion  on  an  official  form.  The  question  about  religion  (it  will  be  Number  19  on  the  new  form)  is  the  only  one  on  the  Census  form  that  you  can  legally  refuse  to  answer.  It  asks  “What  is  the  person’s  religion?”  —  a  variation  on  pre  vious  forms,  which  asked:  “What  is  the  person’s  religious  denomination?”   Some  members  of  the  Jewish  community  regard  the  question  as  an  invasion  of  privacy.  Some  don’t  answer  because  they  aren’t  reli  giously  observant.  Others  abstain  simply  because  they  don’t  have  to  answer.   But  at  least  one  study  has  shown  that  some  in  the  Jewish  community,  particularly  Holocaust  survivors  and  their  descendants,  fear  that  their  recorded  answers  might  some  how  make  them  vulnerable  to  antisemitic  acts  if  an  extremist  government  were  to  come  to   power.   This  is  despite  repeated  reassurances  from  the  Australian  Bureau  of  Statistics  that  Census  collectors  and  statisticians  can  be  fined  or  imprisoned  for  divulging  personal  information   and  that  once  the  data  has  been  fed  into  com   puters,  coded  find  edited,  it  is  impossible  to  identify  respondents.  The  original  forms  are  pulped  and  turned  into  recycled  paper  and   cardboard.   Community  leaders  believe  that  because  so  many  Jews  have  avoided  answering  the  ques  tion  on  religion,  previous  Census  results  have  consistently  understated  the  true  size  of  Australia’s  Jewish  community.   In  the  last  Census,  in  1996,  just  under  80,000  people  declared  themselves  to  be  Jewish.  On  those  figures,  Jews  represented  less  than  half  of  one  percent  of  Australia’s  population,  although  community  leaders  believe  the  true  size  of  Australia’s  Jewish  community  to  be  105,000  or   more.   This  understatement  has  been  the  pattern  over  years.  In  the  decade  1981-91,  for  example,  the  number  of  Jews  recorded  in  the  Census  rose  by  about  16  percent.  By  contrast,  Moslems  and  Buddhists,  almost  invisible  in  Census  results  until  recent  times,  have  become  fast  growing  religions  in  Australia  and,  therefore,  of  growing  electoral  and  social  importance.   Buddhist  numbers  between  1981  and  1991   jumped  by  almost  400  percent.  The  last  Census  revealed  more  than  200,000  followers  of  Islam   (1.12  percent  of  the  population)  and  200,000  Buddhists  (1.1  percent  of  the  population).   This  growth  is  reflected  in  the  form  to  be  used  in  the  next  Census.  Until  now,  only  Christian  religions  (and,  strangely,  those  with  no  religion)  have  been  listed  with  boxes  to  be  ticked.  Lack  of  space  on  the  Census  form  and  frequency  of  responses  in  past  Censuses  from  the  Catholic,  Anglican,  Uniting,  Presbyterian,  Greek  Orthodox,  Baptist  and  Lutheran  church  es  were  reasons  the  Bureau  gave  for  this.   But  for  the  2001  Census,  more  space  has  been  made  available,  and  Islam  and  Buddhism  will  be  listed  with  individual  boxes  to  be  ticked.  However,  if  you  are  Jewish,  Hindu,  a  Salvationist  or  a  humanist,  or  follow  some  minor  faith,  you  will  again  have  to  write  your  religion  in  a  box  labelled  “Other  —  please  specify”.   Perhaps  if  the  next  Census  establishes  more  accurately  the  size  of  the  Jewish  population  of   Australia,  there  could  in  future  be  a  separate  box  for  Jews  to  tick;  but  there  is  a  more  impor  tant  reason  why  everyone  should  answer  the  religious  question:  this  information  helps  gov  ernment  agencies  to  plan  facilities  and  services  and  how  and  where  the  government  might  dis  tribute  grants  for  non-government  schools  and  other  community  services.  Moreover,  estab  lishing  accurate  community  numbers  could  add  more  clout  to  representations  to  state  and  federal  governments  and  MPs.   FOOTNOTE:  For  those  unworried  by  the  reli  gion  question  and  who  would  like  to  have  details  of  their  lives  recorded  for  posterity,  the  2001  Census  form  offers  an  option.  You  may  vol  unteer  to  have  your  personal  Census  informa  tion  micro-filmed  and  held  under  lock  and  key  in  the  National  Archives  of  Australia  for  the  next  99  years.  Only  then,  and  not  before  for  any  purpose,  will  it  be  available  for  public  scrutiny ",2000-10-13
"  IIS  ELECTION  2000   Michael  Jordan   NEW  YORK:  Not  surprisingly,  the  raucous  Hillary  2000  celebration  in  New  York  was  teem  ing  with  Jewish  supporters.  What  was  surpris  ing  is  that  Hillary  Clinton  fared  much  worse  among  the  all-important  Jewish  voting  bloc  —  which  constitutes  14  percent  of  the  New  York  electorate  —  than  conventional  wisdom  sug  gested  was  necessary  for  a  Democrat  to  win.   Three  polls  said  the  Jewish  vote  was  58-41,  5643  and  5345  in  Clinton’s  favour,  with  some  pundits  and  pollsters  saying  she  would  need  to  win  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  Jewish  vote.  Nevertheless,  she  coasted  to  a  landmark  victo  ry  over  her  Republican  opponent,  Rick  Lazio,  by  56  to  44  percent  to  earn  the  right  to  repre  sent  New  York  State  in  the  US  Senate.   There  is  speculation  that  if  George  W  Bush  wins  the  presidential  race  over  A1  Gore,  Hillary  Clinton  could  have  a  strong  chance  of  ousting  him  from  the  White  House  in  2004,  which  would  create  a  Bush-Clinton-Bush-Clinton  suc  cession  of  US  presidents.  Her  chances  would  be  enhanced  if  Gore  disappeared  from  the  scene  (by  losing  to  Bush  in  the  current  race).   In  what  was  the  most  closely  watched  Senate  race  in  the  country,  Clinton  became  the  first  First  Lady  elected  to  public  office.   While  her  victory  was  declared  early,  later  in  the  evening,  the  festive  mood  was  tempered  and  even  punctured  by  the  struggle  of  the   Gore-Lieberman  ticket.   A  canvassing  of  the  crowd  found  Jewish  opinion  plentiful  and  varied  on  the  matter  of  Clinton  and  “the  Jewish  vote”.  Hillary  Clinton  is  either  loved  or  hated  by  voters  —  a  polari  sation  reflected  among  Jews  as  well.   While  many  share  her  liberal  values,  some  Jews  view  her  as  pro-Palestinian,  or  resented  her  “carpetbagging”,  or  are  angered  by  her  stance  against  school  vouchers  —  an  issue  popular  among  Orthodox  Jews.   “The  more  conservative  voters  were  the  more  vocal,”  said  Rabbi  Marc  Schneier,  presi  dent  of  the  North  American  Board  of  Rabbis,  but  “in  the  end,  her  views  mirrored  the  views  of  mainstream  New  York  Jewry”.   Among  the  Orthodox,  who  often  tend  to  be  more  politically  conservative,  Clinton  had  her  share  of  backers,  including  among  the  ultra  Orthodox.  At  the  celebration  last  Tuesday  night,  there  was  a  smattering  of  black  hats  and  peyot  visible.   “Bill  Clinton  never  hated  Jews,  so  I  was   Hillary  Clinton  ...  the  first  First  Lady  to  win  public  office.   never  concerned  that  Hillary  might  hate  Jews,”  said  Rabbi  Leib  Glanz,  a  Satmar  Chassid  from  Brooklyn.   While  Lazio’s  support  for  school  vouchers  galvanised  many  in  the  Orthodox  community,   Feminists  felt  she  should  have  left   her  husband  after  the  Monica   Lewinsky  imbroglio,  while  sexists  thought  she  should  stand  by  her  man,  do  her  wifely  duties  and  not  be  too  ambitious  by  running  for   public  office.   he  said  the  people  he  knew  who  voted  for  Lazio  did  so  “not  because  they  knew  of  him  before,  or  believed  in  him,  but  because  they  wanted  to  vote  for  someone  from  New  York”.   On  the  other  hand,  at  least  one  Jewish  observer  said  Clinton’s  outsider  status  proba  bly  helped  her.  “Specifically  because  she  was  an  outsider,  she  either  understood  or  was   compelled  to  listen  very  carefully  to  New  Yorkers,”  said  Irwin  Kula,  president  of  CLAL  —  the  National  Jewish  Centre  for  Learning  and  Leadership.  “It  would  have  been  very  easy  for  her  to  concentrate  on  New  York  City,  but  she  went  out  of  her  way,  almost,  to  go  upstate  and  sit  and  listen  to  people.  She  was  able  to  project  a  sense  of  inclusiveness.”   Back  at  the  celebrations,  a  middle-aged  Clinton  supporter,  Lucile  Kleiman,  offered  her  perspective  on  some  of  the  hostility  towards  the  First  Lady,  from  both  Jews  and  non-Jews.  “Feminists  felt  she  should  have  left  her  hus  band”  after  the  Monica  Lewinsky  imbroglio,  Kleiman  said,  “while  sexists  thought  she  should  stand  by  her  man,  do  her  wifely  duties  and  not  be  too  ambitious”  by  running  for  pub  lic  office.   Kleiman,  however,  described  herself  as  “delighted”  and  “relieved”  by  Clinton’s  elec  toral  success,  and  was  confident  that  the  sen  ator-elect  would  represent  the  interests  of  Jewish  and  non-Jewish  New  Yorkers  alike.  “I’ve  always  thought  she  would  fight  fairly  and  squarely  for  anybody,  not  just  Jews.  When  she’ll  be  in  the  Senate,  I  know  that  when  she  raises  her  hand,  she’ll  be  raising  it  for  issues   that  are  best  for  this  nation.   JTA ",2000-11-17

Michael  Stiassny,  a  member  of  the  project’s  Planning  Committee,  said  the  process  was  taking  longer  than  expected  partly  because  of  die  need  to  remove  a  Telecom  mobile  phone  antenna  on  the  die.

"  Not  Jewish  enough?  Searching  for  my  Jewish  self   Not-quite-Jewish  Brad  Syke  discusses  his   identity  on  the  edge.   WHO  is  a  Jew?  What  is  Jewishness?  And  can  you  have  Jewishness  with  out  being  a  Jew?   These  are  not  new  questions.  Nor  are  questions,  per  se,  new  to  the  practice  of  Judaism.  Indeed,  interro  gation  of  faith  is  largely  what  informs  and  distinguishes  Judaism.   But  these  questions  are  fascinat  ing  not  only  the  Jews  but  to  a  good  many  gentiles.  And  they  are  particu  larly  pertinent  to  some,  such  as  I,  who  find  themselves  betwixt  and  between  the  rock  of  ages  and  a  hard  place.   My  father  was  a  Jew;  my  mother  was  not.  I  was  duly  circumcised,  but  christened  an  Anglican.  My  father  endowed  my  two  younger  brothers  and  I  with  decidedly  Anglo-American  names  to  spare  us  the  prejudice  he  so  feared  and  had  so  often  experienced.   He  was  not  a  practicing  Jew.  His  childhood  experiences  of  war  in  Europe  and  the  inevitable  disappear  ances  of  close  relatives  and  friends  had  left  him  scarred  and  with  a  dis  dain  for  all  religion.  He  saw  it,  more   or  less,  as  the  root  cause  of  all  the  world’s  problems,  even  the  root  of  all  evil;  a  view  which,  although  per  haps  dangerously  simplistic,  is  hard  ly  insupportable  in  view  of  the  sheer  weight  of  historical  evidence.   Nevertheless,  for  many  years  I  have  found  this  view  and  his  concur  rent  decision  to  practically  ignore  his  heritage  desperately  tragic,  while  retaining  a  great  sympathy  for  his   reaction.   So  much  so,  that  when  I’ve  encountered  antisemitism,  I’ve  arguably  over-compensated  by  proudly  identifying  as  a  Jew,  so  as  to  embarrass  and,  for  a  deliciously  vin  dictive  moment,  diminish  the  igno  rant,  offending  party.  I’ve  always  felt  quite  guilty  in  so  doing  because  I’m  not,  in  an  orthodox,  traditional  or  technical  sense,  a  Jew.   But  as  the  years  have  passed  and  my  investigations  of  faith,  religion  and  the  big  questions  have  contin  ued  and  expanded,  I  have  found  I  feel  more  and  more  Jewish.  I  can  recall  my  own  father,  in  rare  confessional  moments,  defiantly  professing  “Jew  ishness”  to  be  in  the  blood  and,  as  such,  undeniable  and  inescapable.   But  does  an  attachment  to  my  paternal  antecedents  explain  my  almost  irresistible  attraction  to  the  spiritual,  mystical,  ethical,  religious,   intellectual  and  cultural  richness  of  the  faith  and  its  followers?   Is  a  burning  desire  to  affirm  and  enhance  my  Jewishness  by  investi  gating  and  studying  Judaism  with  a  view  to  conversion  (if,  indeed,  that’s  what’s  required)  enough  to  qualify  me  to  become  a  Jew?  Or  does  my  lack  of  orthodox  birthright  really   exclude  me  from  the  club  forever?  Can  I  ever  truly  be  a  Jew?   My  greatest  fear,  of  course,  is  that  even  if  I  should  be  deemed  to  qualify  one  way  or  another,  sooner  or  later,  as  a  Jew,  I  will  not  be  widely  accept  ed  by  the  Jewish  community.  Will  I  forever  be  regarded  as  a  ‘second  class’  Jew;  a  ring-in;  a  fake;  a  Jacob  come-latefy?  Will  the  onus  always  be  on  me  to  prove  my  legitimacy  as  a  Jew?  In  other  words,  how  much  “Jewishness”  is  enough?   Rabbi  Morris  Kertzer  in  his  1953  book  What  is  a  Jew?  wrote  that  being  a  Jew  meant  “having  a  profound  love  and  respect  for  the  ideal  of  commu  nity”.  Perhaps  this  is  why,  at  least  in  part,  I’ve  found  the  synagogue  to  be  such  a  warm,  welcoming  and  com  forting  place,  where  people  have  a  genuine  interest  in  meeting  and  knowing  others.   Being  a  Jew,  for  Rabbi  Kertzer,  also  means  “seeing  yourself  as  a  sacred  link  between  past  and   future”;  a  concept  he  calls  “mystical  continuity”,  one  to  which,  1  believe,  1  can  relate.  This,  for  mine,  explains  feeling  Jewish  and  my  father’s  implicit  contention  about  stirrings  in  the  blood.  Indeed,  it  is  Kertzer’s  mys  tical  continuity  which  has  brought  me,  albeit  somewhat  circuitously,  to  Judaism;  stemming  from  my  desire,  or  need,  to  connect  with  my  paternal  heritage  and  enable  the  past  —  my  family’s  past  —  to  have  meaning  and  resonance  in  the  future.   Being  a  Jew  also  means  believing  in  a  common  destiny,  writes  Rabbi  Kertzner.  Hard  to  argue  with,  or  dis  believe,  that  “Jews  also  believe  we  shall  accomplish  God’s  task  not  singly,  but  together  with  other  Jews”.  This  concept  is  powerfully,  and  poetically,  exemplified  in  day-to  day  Jewish  practice  in  the  form  of  minyan,  during  which  Jews  pray  in  groups  of  10  or  more.   Jews  also  believe,  Rabbi  Kertzer  asserts,  in  “redemption  for  all  the  world,  brought  about  by  communi  ties  (of  Jews)  working  together  to  instil  in  every  other  Jew  the  very  best  God  has  given”.  I’m  not  at  all  sure  how  this  is  achieved,  but  maybe  it’s  related  to  the  frequent  tut-tutting  I  hear  at  shule.   Being  Jewish  also  entails  banding  together  to  fight  antisemitism,  which   remains,  incredibly,  all  too  pervasive  and  insidious.  Again,  it  was  largely  my  father’s  experience  of  such  which  brought  me  to  the  faith.   But  the  responsibilities  of  being  a  Jew  don’t  end  even  there  according  to  Rabbi  Kertzer.  What  about  the  education  of  the  next  generation?  Helping  Israel?  And,  perhaps  the  loftiest  and  most  idealistic  of  all,  “bettering  society  by  applying  the  ethics  of  Judaism  to  business,  pub  lic  policy  and  the  like”?  If  nothing  else,  with  so  many  questions  and  so  few  answers,  I  now  see  why  so  many  of  the  answers  to  questions  are  questions.   H  Brad  Syke  is  a  Sydney  writer ",2001-10-26
"  Nissim  Cunio,  grandson  of  a  former  rabbi  of  the  synagogue,  was  left  free.   Cunio  was  jailed  later  in  the  war  when  he  was  caught  trying  to  take  food  to  his  father  in  one  of  the  camps.  Life  in  the  camps  was  frugal,  with  little  to  do,  and  with  less  and  less  food  available  as  the  war  worsened  for  the  Japanese.   Russian  Jews  (mainly  living  in  Hongkew  if  poorer,  or  in  the  French  Concession)  remained  outside  the  round-up  of  the  “allies”,  as  Japan   was  not  at  war  with  the  USSR.  There  was,  however,  considerable  antisemitism  in  the  Japanese  controlled  media,  reflecting  the  influence  of  White  Russian  fascists.   Families  such  as  Rachel  Kofman  and  her  husband,  Vladimir,  whose  father  had  been  one  of  those  kidnapped  and  murdered  in  Harbin,  continued  with  their  lives.  Some  became  involved  in  businesses  related  to  the  Japanese  occupation.  In  some  cases  businesses  owned  by  American  or  British  companies  continued  under  Japanese  control.   Efim  Krouk,  whose  father  had  returned  to  the  USSR  from  Harbin  and  perished  there  as  a  Harbintsy,  continued  to  work  for  an  American  company,  but  under  Japanese  control.  He  also  established  a  bakery  in  Dalny  Road,  Hongkew.   The  central  European  Jews  lived  mainly  in  Hongkew,  just  across  the  Garden  Bridge  from  the  original  International  Settlement.  The  area  had  been  damaged  in  the  1937  fighting  between  Japanese  marines  and  Chinese  soldiers  —  and  rebuilt  by  work-gangs  of  the  refugees  during  1939  and  1940.  They  found  work  in  many  ways  —  some  as  doctors,  dentists  and  even  lawyers.   Some,  like  Lisl  Rosner,  became  teachers  at  the  Kadourie-supported  Shanghai  Jewish  Youth  Association  School,  which  many  of  the  Hongkew  refugee  children  attended.  Her  father,  a  musician,  worked  as  a  member  of  the  Shanghai  Symphony  Orchestra.  Fred  Gunsberger,  a  refugee  from  Vienna  who  had  escaped  through  Germany,  Poland  and  the  USSR  to  Manchuria,  worked  for  a  Japanese  dairy  company.   The  small  community  of  Polish  Jews  were  supported  in  part  by  the  Polish  Government-in-Exile  and  the  American  Joint  Committee.  The  over  200  rabbinical  students  and  rabbis  of  the  Mir  Yeshiva  were  given  the  use  of  the  Beth  Aharon  Sephardic  synagogue.  Polish  residents’  certificates  were  issued,  and  communal  kitchens  established.   Estera  Weyland,  a  Sugihara  survivor,  took  responsibility  for  running  one  of  those  kitchens,  initially  in  the  French  Concession  near  the  Jewish  Hospital,  and  then  in  Hongkew.  The  family  used  to  buy  its  bread  from  Krouk’s  bakery.   In  late  1942  the  Gestapo’s  Colonel  Meisinger  arrived  in  Shanghai,  bearing  orders  from  Berlin  to  ensure  the  Japanese  helped  organise  the  Final  Solution  for  all  Jews  in  the  city.  Jewish  leaders  worked  with  Japanese  Consul  Shibata  to  undermine  his  influence.   Ultimately,  the  Japanese  rejected  the  Nazi  demands,  but  created  instead  a  Designated  Area  in  Hongkew  in  which  all  post-1937  refugees  would  be  forced  to  live.  This  “ghetto”  became  home  to  over  20,000  Jews  from  mid-1943,  most  living  in  cramped  and  unhygienic  conditions,  squeezed  into  heims  or  as  families  living  in  single  rooms.   Sephardic  and  Russian  families  supported  the  refugees,  inviting  them  home  for  Sabbath  meals.  The  Joint  reorganised  its  facilities  so  that  funds  were  provided  through   the  Swiss  Red  Cross.   As  the  war  progressed,  these   resources  were  squeezed;  they  were  used  to  support  a  number  of  communal  kitchens.   The  ghetto  was  controlled  by  Sergeant  Ghoya,  a  Japanese  military  police  officer.  He  was  a  vicious  and  egotistical  martinet,  using  his  power   to  humiliate  Jews  seeking  his'  permission  to  move  in  and  out  of  the  ghetto.  He  described  himself  as  “King  of  the  Jews”.  Many  refugees  report  his  practice  of  standing  on  a  table  and  slapping  applicants  for  passes  who  displeased  him.   Within  the  ghetto,  life  was  crowded  but  intense.  Chusan  Road  served  as  a  central  road  with  cafes  and  meeting  places.   Many  of  the  refugees  could  barely  afford  to  use  these  facilities;  Liesl  Rosner  (Gerber)  remembers  being  invited  by  young  men  for  tea.  Some  had  passes  to  leave  the  area  on  a  regular  basis.  Rosner  worked  as  a  Music  Appreciation  teacher  at  the  Kadourie  SJYA  school,  outside  the  ghetto.  Esther  Szekeres,  a  Hungarian  refugee,  lived  in  Hongkew  with  her  husband  George,  although  her  Hungarian  passport  allowed  her  to  be  identified  as  an  Axis  citizen,  and  she  was  free  to  move  about  the  city.  She  was  a  bookkeeper  in  the  French  Concession  for  a  nightclub  owner.   olek  Jakubowicz  made  the  long  daily  trip  across  the  city  -i—&amp;  to  the  Shanghai  Jewish  Club  in   Rue  Pichon  in  the  French  Concession,  where  he  worked  as  the  accountant  to  the  mainly  Russian   board.   The  teenage  Marcel  Weyland  daily  rode  to  the  Shanghai  Jewish  School  in  Seymour  Road,  where  he  was  a  top  student.  Fred  Gunsberger  ran  his  Ward  Road  small  margarine  factory,  which  supplied  Viennese  cake  shops  in  Chusan  Road.   In  March  1945  American  bombs  rained  on  the  ghetto,  aiming  for  but  missing  an  adjacent  munitions  plant.  Dozens  of  refugees  were  killed.  The  Kadourie  school  was  just  due  to  let  its  children  go  home,  but  its  air  raid  warden  told  them  to  stay  put  and  they  survived.  Halina  Jakubowicz  remembers  being  hurled  through  a  window  in  the  Tongshan  Road  communal  kitchen  where  she  worked  with  her  mother.   Most  of  the  refugees  remember  the  end  of  the  war  as  a  moment  when  they  heard  the  Internationale  being  sung  by  Russians.  Danny  Moalem  awoke  to  find  his  camp  deserted  by  its  Japanese  guards.  In  the  ghetto  Japanese  shops  were  left  open.  Ghoya  was  seized  and  beaten.  Russian  Jews  heard  of  the  Soviet  invasion  of  Manchuria  and  its  declaration  of  war  a  week  before  the  bombing  of  Hiroshima.   With  the  arrival  of  American   Four  doctors  share  a  consultation  room  In  Shanghai.   troops  in  support  of  the  Nationalist  Chinese  leader  Chiang  Kai  Shek,  life  changed  again.  Many  of  the  Jews  found  work  with  the  new  occupying  power.  George  Szekeres,  a  mathematician,  was  sent  to  count  American  planes  taking  off;  Bolek  Jakubowicz  worked  as  an  accountant  for  the  main  US  Post   Exchange  (PX)  at  the  Shanghai   racecourse.   The  most  stunning  consequence  of  the  American  arrival  was  news  reels  of  the  liberation  of  the  Nazi  camps.  Over  a  period  of  weeks,  the  Jews  from  Europe  had  to  come  to  terms  with  the  horror  of  that  tragedy,  while  the  post-war  culture  of  America  swamped  the  city.   Gone  with  the  Wind  and  Fantasia  played  at  cinemas,  while  the  symphony  continued  to  perform;  on   the  walls  of  Hongkew  long  lists  of  Holocaust  names  were  placed  by  the  Red  Cross  and  Jewish  agencies.   In  the  French  Concession  the  Russian  Jews  re-established  their  lives  and  began  to  take  stock  of  the  changing  landscape.  Communist  victories  were  reported  from  the  north  and  west.  The  Nationalists  were  corrupt,  looting  and  extorting  the  city.  The  refugees  looked  for  a  way  out.  For  those  with  relatives  in  Australia,  that  could  be  the  goal,  as  few  wished  to  return  to  Europe.   Many  others,  particularly  members  of  Betar,  planned  to  go  to  Palestine.  The  Sephardic  Jews  realised  that  the  lives  they  had  known  were  gone;  many  of  the  wealthy  members  had  moved  their  businesses  out  of  China.   Over  the  four  years  up  to  the   Communist  victory  and  takeover  of  Shanghai,  most  Jews  made  arrangements  to  leave.  George  Szekeres  found  a  job  as  a  mathematician  at  Adelaide  University.  Fred  Gunsberger  joined  his  brother  in  Sydney.

"  Comic  gets  Jewish  flavour   THE  American  funny  pages  are  getting  a  little  Yiddishkeit  these  days.  Syndicated  comic  strip  Gil  Thorp  is  soon  to  feature  a  storyline  about  star  athlete  David  Green,  an  Orthodox  Jew  who  joins  his  high   school  football  team.   The  strip,  which  has  been  published  since  1959  and  runs  daily  in  more  than  65  newspapers,  focuses  on  the  challenges  of  a  high  school  sports  coach.  And  life  is  about  to  get  a  bit  more  difficult  for  Thorp,  who  coach  es  football,  basketball  and  baseball  at  imaginary  Milford  High  School.   Adding  the  ft/pa-wearing  Green  to  the  team  forces  Thorp  to  confront  new  issues,  according  to  Gil  Fried,  a  sports  management  professor  at  the  University  of  New  Haven  in  Connecticut,  who  provided  the  idea  for  the  strip.  Problems  arise  because  the  school’s  weekly  games  take  place  on  Friday  afternoon  or  evening  and  conflict  with  Shabbat.

"  Ukranlan  and  North  American  members  of  the  Hlilel  Pesach  Project  lead  a  seder  in  central  Ukraine.   Ukrainian  Jewish  revival   Michael  J  Jordan   reports  a  dramatic  twist  to  the  seder   theme  “and  you  shall  tell  your  children  ...”   IT  is  the  second  night  of  Passover,  and  here  in  Ukraine  it  is  the  children  who  must  tell  their  parents.   After  75  years  of  repressive,  anti  clerical  communism,  Jewish  tradi  tion  has  been  flipped  on  its  head,  with  the  younger  generations  carry  ing  the  torch  of  Jewish  observance.   In  Khmelnitski,  a  provincial  hub  in  western  Ukraine,  a  blue-on-white  banner  draped  outside  the  main  the  atre  broadcasts  the  Jewish  celebra  tion:  “Happy  and  Kosher  Pesach”  it  reads  in  Cyrillic.   The  previous  night,  Chabad  emis  saries  ran  three  simultaneous  sedarim.  Tonight,  three  Ukrainian  Jewish  stu  dents  and  three  American  students  visiting  from  Israel  run  one  seder.   Though  many  of  the  150  partici  pants  begin  noshing  from  the  seder  plates  before  each  item  has  been  explained,  the  evening  hits  its  stride  with  the  start  of  singing  and  dap  ping.  The  students  are  thrilled.   “This  is  how  it  ought  to  be,”  says  20-year-old  Michael  Berkenwald,  one  of  25  North  Americans  visiting  Ukraine  while  on  a  year  abroad  at  Hebrew  University  in  Jerusalem.  “Once  you  get  the  kids  engaged,  they’ll  engage  the  parents.”   The  primary  aim  of  the  Hillel  Pesach  Project  is  to  spread  “Jewish  joy”  to  Jews  throughout  the  former  Soviet  Union  (FSU),  who  in  most  cases  have  never  experienced  such  joy.   The  program  has  bloomed  expo  nentially.  In  1996,  it  trained  60  local  Jewish  students  to  lead  about  60  sedarim.  This  year,  it  prepped  1,000  students  to  conduct  500  sedarim  in  350  communities,  reaching  tens  of  thousands  of  Jews.   Even  more  moving  is  the  parallel  “Project  Elijah”,  delivering  matzah,  Haggadot  and  Judaism  to  the  elderly  and  infirm  who  can’t  make  it  to  the  communal  sedarim.   “It  is  said  that  Elijah  the  Prophet  visits  every  Jewish  home,”  says  Hil  lel  associate  vice-president  Rabbi  Yossi  Goldman,  who  founded  the  Hillel  FSU  and  both  Pesach  projects.  “It’s  a  wonderful  way  to  connect  the  grandparents,  who  are  so  lonely,  with  the  wider  Jewish  community.”   The  shtetls  and  cities  of  Ukraine   produced  writers  Sholem  Aleichem  and  Isaac  Babel,  Zionists  Ze’ev  Jabotinsky  and  Golda  Meir,  and  the  venerated  founder  of  Chassidism,  the  Ba’al  Shem  Tov.   It  also  produced  the  worst  pre  Nazi  genocide  of  Jews;  about  1648  some  100,000  were  slaughtered.   During  and  after  the  Stalinist  tyranny,  fealty  to  any  authority  but  the  Communist  Party  was  viewed  as  threatening  and  merited  harsh  retri  bution.  Practicing  tradition  could  cost  jobs,  prison  or  worse.   Yet  despite  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  freedom  to  emi  grate,  many  decided  to  stay.   “Ukraine  today  boasts  Europe’s  third  largest   Jewish  population,   estimated  at  500,000.  Only   the  oldest  generation  has   any  ‘Jewish  memory’.”   Ukraine  today  boasts  Europe’s  third  largest  Jewish  population,  esti  mated  at  500,000.  Only  the  oldest  generation  has  any  “Jewish  memo  ry”.  Their  middle-aged  children,  who  grew  up  under  communism,  are  “the  lost  generation”.   For  many,  their  only  connection  to  their  Jewishness  in  Soviet  times  was  the  stamp  in  their  identification  papers  —  Evrei  —  or  the  anti  semitism  sanctioned  by  the  state  and  dished  out  on  the  streets.   Even  today,  a  kippah-wearer  is  like  ly  to  take  some  blows  in  Lvov,  the  nationalist  hotbed  in  western  Ukraine.   An  elderly  Ukranlan  Jew,  highly   decorated  for  combat  In  World  War  II.   Photos;  JTA   Zhid  is  still  a  common  insult  here,  translated  as  “dirty  Jew”.   However,  the  younger  generation  appear  curious  and  hungry  to  learn  all  that  was  kept  from  their  parents.   Most  do  so  through  Hillel,  or  Kiev’s  1,300-student  International  Solomon  University,  the  formal  insti  tution  of  Jewish  learning.   But  it  was  out  in  the  provinces  ^  that  the  American  students  got  their  real  experience  of  the  program.   In  ramshackle  villages  of  the  south-western  region  of  Bukovina  the  students  were  startled  by  the  depth  of  economic  deprivation,  especially  among  the  elderly.   Most  live  in  crumbling  apartments  that  are  dark  and  dank,  with  stained  walls  that  are  mouldy  and  cracked,  and  plumbing  worthy  of  the  Third  World.   The  majority,  who  receive  pen  sions  ranging  from  $US6  to  $US20  a  month  depend  on  JDC-funded  wel  fare  dispensed  by  the  local  Hesed   Besht  charity.  It  provides  free  ~  medication  and  health  care,  launder  ing,  and  even  such  services  as  watch,  television  and  radio  repairs.   Most  important,  thousands  receive  monthly  parcels  of  rice,  oil,  sugar  and  bouillon.   “Without  it,  they  would  starve,”  says  Igor  Ratushniy,  director  of  the   Hesed-Besht  in  Khmelnitski.   All  in  all,  Ukraine’s  elderly  Jews  live  out  their  remaining  years  in  a   most  undignified  manner.  Project  *  Elijah  provided  them  a  brief  respite.   The  students  came  bearing  matzah  and  Haggadot  and  asked  about  the  hosts’  “Jewish  memories”.   It  didn’t  take  much  to  bring  tears.  One  man  spoke  of  the  odes  he  wrote  to  matzah.  Another  man  with  no  legs  recalled  the  Hebrew  he  had  learned  60  years  ago.   A  former  soccer  and  weightlifting  coach  in  his  70s,  with  a  single  swatch  of  red  hair  across  his  bald  pate,  burst  forth  with  two  Yiddish  songs,  wiping   the  tears  from  his  cheeks.  ,   The  emotion  was  even  more  evi  dent  when  the  students  began  singing  Mah  Nishtanah,  Dayenu,  or  Shalom  Aleichem.  The  hosts  either  mouthed  the  words,  sang  along  or  smiled  enormously.   It  was  a  way  for  the  visitors  to  have  “instant  impact”  and  “to  create  Jewish  joy  and  Jewish  communica  tion  with  people  with  whom  you  can’t  communicate  through  language”.   As  a  one-legged  man  who  hosted  *  a  seder  with  the  only  other  Jews  in  his  village  —  his  son  and  grandson  —  told  the  visitors:  “I  dreamt  this  day  would  one  day  come;  now  it  has;  finally  happened.”  JTA ",2001-04-27
"  Criticising  Israel  doesn  t  make  a  Jew  an  enemy   Unity,  but  not   uniformity,  is  good  for  the  Jews,  argues   JEWISH  unity  is  a  very  good  thing,   is  something  we  should  always  have,  and  when  we  don’t,  it’s  something  we  should  always  work  for.   Jewish  uniformity  is  a  very  bad  thing.  Indeed  it  is  a  very  un-Jewish  thing.  It  is  something  we  should  always  resist  and  something  we  have  way  too  much  of.   Though  more  Jews  are  more  free  than  ever  before,  there  are  fewer  independent  Jewish  voices  than  ever  before,  a  far  greater  price  to  pay  for  anyone  who  deviates  from  the  official  Jewish  line  of  the  moment.   The  Amish  shun  those  Amish  who  don’t  stay  in  line.  The  Jews  destroy  those  Jews  who  don’t  stay  in  line.  Call  them  the  ugliest  of  names,  treat  them  in  the  ugliest  of  ways.  Savage  them,  then  dismiss  them  from  the  Jewish  people.   What  is  most  tragic  about  making  those  who  say  things  that  are  unpop  ular,  dare  to  question  our  leaders  and  our  organisations,  dare  to  be  critical  of  Israel,  pay  a  price  for  doing  so,  is  that  all  of  Judaism  pays  a  huge  price  for  doing  that.   At  its  very  essence,  Judaism  is  about  questioning,  disagreeing,  probing.  That  is  what  has  made  Jew  ish  minds  and  spirits  so  sharp  for  so  long.  We’ve  always  had  a  variety  of  perspectives  and  always  benefited  when  each  has  been  expressed  and  been  listened  to.  By  hearing  things  you  don’t  agree  with  and  treating  them  with  respect,  you  learn  some  thing,  something  that  might  cause  you  to  reconsider  your  position  or  that  will  help  you  to  strengthen  it  by  forcing  you  to  defend  it.  By  seeing  the  other  side  clearly,  you  come  to  see  your  own  better.   Unity  is  Jews  embracing,  respect  ing,  loving  all  Jews  all  the  time.  It  is  not  putting  aside  our  differences  but  rather  it  is  celebrating  them,  accept  ing  and  being  grateful  that  there  are   Jews  who  don’t  believe  or  act  as  we  do  and  loving  them  nonetheless,  lov  ing  them  not  despite  that,  but  because  of  that,  feeling  a  connection  to  each  and  every  Jew  no  matter  what.  That  is  unity  and  there  is  less  of  that  today  than  there  ever  was.   Uniformity  is  about  eliminating  differences,  expecting  all  Jews  to  think  the  same,  act  the  same  and  having  nothing  to  do  with  those  who  are  different.  There  is  more  of  that  today  than  there  ever  was.   On  a  big  picture  level,  that’s  because  of  two  things.  One  is  the  ever-increasing  consolidation  of  Jew  ish  life,  with  huge  Jewish  organisa  tions  increasingly  dominating   Jewish  life,  controlling  much  of  its  money  and  power.  The  other  is  the  increasing  power  and  freedom  that  Jews  enjoy,  power  and  freedom  we  simply  can’t  handle  because  it  is  a  phenomenon  so  new  to  us,  so  differ  ent  for  us.  We  haven’t  yet  gotten  used  to  the  fact  that  we  are  not  being  persecuted  from  the  outside,  aren’t  surrounded  by  enemies  and  so  we  spend  all  the  energy  we  used  to  use  to  fight  those  outside  us  and  use  it  instead  against  Jews  not  like  us.   “It  is  becoming  almost   traitorous  for  a  Jew  to  say   anything  not  in  keeping  with   the  Jewishly  correct  line.   JC,  I  call  it,  the  Jewish  version  of  PC,  politically   correct,  and  about  as  Jewish  as  that  first  JC.""   Because  of  what’s  going  on,  because  of  how  abominably  the  Pales  tinians  have  been  acting,  because  of  such  things  as  the  heartbreaking  murder  of  a  10-month-old  Israeli  girl  sitting  in  her  stroller,  the  calls  for  uniformity  are  louder  than  ever.   But  Jews  need  to  be  involved  and  to  feel  free  to  see  things  as  they  see  them,  say  things  as  they  see  them.   We  need  to  be  at  our  best  and  that  means  being  our  most  authentic  selves.  And  that  means  having  all  kinds  of  viewpoints.  It  does  not  mean  falling  into  line.   Most  of  our  history  we’ve  been  under  attack,  and  because  we  have  been  so  few  and  so  weak  and  those  attacking  us  have  been  so  much  stronger  and  bigger,  we  couldn’t  afford  the  luxury  of  discord  within,  didn’t  have  the  luxury  to  be  debat  ing,  when  we  had  to  focus  our  all  on  surviving.   But  that  was  right  for  another  time.  This  time,  we  are  strong.  We  should  feel  that  and  act  accordingly.  Israel  is  an  incredibly  powerful  coun  try  in  every  way.  Militarily,  cultural  ly,  economically,  diplomatically.   Admit  it,  you  flinched  when  read  ing  that  last  sentence.  You  don’t  accept  that,  are  angry  to  hear  that.  That’s  because  your  heart  hasn’t  caught  up  with  your  head.  That’s   true  of  most  Jews.  We  still  see  our  selves  as  the  underdog  and  so  not  able  to  tolerate,  let  alone  welcome,  a  smorgasbord  of  Jewish  views.   We  need  to  welcome  a  variety  of  Jewish  perspectives,  feel  free  to  say  what  we  think  about  what’s  going  on  in  Israel.  Even  now.  Especially  now.   It  is  becoming  almost  traitorous  for  a  Jew  to  say  anything  not  in  keep  ing  with  the  Jewishly-correct  line.  JC,  I  call  it,  the  Jewish  version  of  PC,  politically  correct,  and  about  as  Jew   ish  as  that  first  JC.   fclie  Wiesel  saia  recently  mat  those  who  criticise  Israel  at  this  time  are  antisemites.  Even  if  they  are  Jews,  especially  if  they  are  Jews.  For  then,  apparently,  they  are  “self-hat  ing”,  “ashamed”,  “enemies  of  Israel”?   How  is  it  possible  to  think  that  if  a  Jew  doesn’t  like  something  about  how  Israel  acts  that  that  makes  him  self-hating,  ashamed,  an  enemy  of   Israel?   As  one  who  occasionally  ques  tions  Israeli  actions,  criticises  aspects  of  Israeli  policy  and  society,  I  know  that  I  do  it  out  of  a  very  deep  love  of  Israel,  a  tremendous  caring  for  Israel.  Would  I  be  a  better  friend  of  Israel  if  I  didn’t  say  anything  about  the  fact  that  its  policies  have  incred  ibly  polluted  Israel’s  air  to  the  point  some  wonder  if  it  will  be  breathable  in  50  years?   Today,  those  who  say  that  unifor  mity  is  the  way,  Israel  is  always  right,  we  must  circle  the  wagons  and  oppose  the  Palestinians,  are  seen  as  the  best  friends  of  Israel.  And  maybe  they  are.  But  can  you  not  also  be  a  friend  by  questioning,  showing  another  way?  Since  we  don’t  know  which  way  is  right,  isn’t  it  better  to  hear  them  all,  consider  them  all,  see  all  who,  out  of  love,  offer  their  views,  as  friends  of  Israel,  with  nobody  get  ting  labelled  self-hating,  ashamed   enemies  of  Israel?

"  Jewish-EWuslint  comedy   TORONTO  comic  Noam  Rosen,  who  arranged  an  evening  of  Jewish  and  Muslim  comedy  at  a  Toronto  nightclub,  says  the  show  was  so  unusual  that  he  has  received  offers  to  take  it  to  New  York  City.   Billed  as  the  “Mid-East  Optimist  Jewish  Muslim  Comedy  Night”,  the  show  featured  a  roster  of  Jewish  and  Muslim  comics  who  poked  fun  at  sacrosanct  politi  cal  issues  and  religious  stereotypes.   Although  few  of  the  comics  directly  addressed  the  ter  ror  attack  of  September  11,  Osama  bin  Laden  and  other  extremists  were  the  targets  of  more  than  a  few  punch  lines.  “It  was  a  full  house,  and  people  loved  it,”  said  Rosen.  “It  was  a  good  crowd  —  lots  of  Muslims,  Christians,  Jews,  even  an  Israeli  or  two.  And  people  got   most  of  the  humour.  It  was  brilliant.” ",2001-12-07
"  Black-Jewish  dilemma   NEW  YORK  —  The  call  for  the  US  to  boycott  the  World  Conference  Against  Racism  has  implications   for  black-Jewish  relations.   No  agreement  has  been  reached  on  calls  for  compen   sation  for  the  trade  in  African  slaves  which  ended  in  the  19th  century.  The  US  and  other  countries  fear  litigation  if  they  formally  apologise  for  centuries  of  slavery  and  make  offers  of  reparations.   If  the  US  boycotts  over  the  Israel  issue  by  keeping  Secretary  of  State  Colin  Powell  at  home,  it  would  undermine  the  credibility  of  any  declaration  to  emerge  from  Durban.  The  US  :  congressional  black  leadership   wants  Powell  to  attend  to  deal  with  the  slavery  issue.  In  exchange  for  supporting  the  Jewish  cause,  US  blacks  want  I  Jews  to  stand  with  them  on  the   slavery  issue.   JTA ",2001-08-24
"  Just  what  is  an  Australian  Jew?   PARTISAN   SAM  UPSKI   IS  there  a  definable  Australian  Judaism?  Or  if  that  limits  the  question  to  matters  religious,  what  about:  Is  there  a  definable  Australian  Jewishness?   Still  too  vague,  too  abstract?  Then  what  do  you  tell  Jews  overseas  when  they  ask  you  what’s  distinctive  about  us?  Come  to  think  of  it,  what  is  Jewishly  different  about  us  from,  say,  our  South  African  cousins,  other  than  our  accents  when  speaking  English  —  “I  say  car  park  and  you  say  caw  pawk”  —  or  from  other  comparable  English-speaking  Jewish  communities,  American  Jewry  excepted?   These  questions  are  worth  asking  at  a  time  when  matters  of  Australian  identity  and  his  tory  generally  are  receiving  welcome  atten  tion  during  the  Centenary  of  Federation,  and  when  at  least  some  sections  of  our  own  community  are  also  reflecting  on  what  it  has  meant,  and  means  today,  to  be  Australian  and  Jewish.  This  newspaper’s  Centenary  of  Federation  supplement  on  Australia  Day  was  a  recent  example.  And  there  are  encouraging  moves  under  way  to  develop  a  curriculum  for  the  long-overdue  study  of  Australian  Jewish  history  in  our  dayschools.   So  what’s  the  Oz  quotient  in  the  Jews  of  Oz?  In  the  summary  overview  I  usually  offer  overseas  inquirers,  I  note  first  that  90  per  cent  of  us  live  in  Sydney  and  Melbourne.  And   then  with  uncritical  and  unabashed  booster  ism,  I  go  on  to  highlight  four  features  that  dif  ferentiate  us  amongst  comparable  Diaspora   communities.   E!  Strong  individual  and  communal  linkages   to  Israel   H  A  widespread  dayschool  network   H  A  pluralist  spectrum  from  ultra-Orthodoxy   to  Bundism   U  Relatively  low  inter-marriage  rates   Mostly,  this  evokes  a  combination  of  sur  prise  and  praise  from  those  unfamiliar  with  Australia  and,  almost  invariably,  the  next  question  is:  “But  what  about  antisemitism?”  When  1  explain  that  although  it  exists,  it  doesn’t  seriously  affect  Jewish  life,  or  our   disproportionately  successful  participation  in  a  multicultural  society,  the  reaction  tends  to  be  that  Australia,  Jewishly  speaking,  has  taken  over  from  America  as  the  goldene  med  ina,  the  “golden  kingdom”  of  the  20th-centu  ry  immigrants’  dreams.   I  suspect  I’m  not  unique  in  promoting  the  virtues  abroad  of  the  Yiddishe  Godzone.  And  as  long  as  that  kind  of  “spin  merchandising”  is  for  export  only,  while  at  home  we  recog  nise  the  shortcomings,  inequities  and  resist  ance  to  change  within  our  community  that  bedevil  our  Jewish  futures  in  this  country,   then  perhaps  no  great  harm  is  done.   But  in  another,  more  unsettling  sense,  such  discussions  always  leave  me  unsatis  fied.  They’re  about  Australian  Jews  collec  tively,  as  the  subjects  of  sociology  and  impressionistic  generalisations,  whereas   what  interests  me  is  the  Australian  Jew  as  an  individual,  the  subject  of  psychology.  For  example:  When  an  Australian  Jew  is  dropped  into  an  international  group  of  British,  French,  American  and  Argentinian  Jews,  whether  as  students,  businessmen,  women’s  organisation  leaders  or  just  another  commit  tee,  would  we  predict  that  he  or  she  would  behave  recognisably  as  “Australian   Jewish?”.   I've  had  no  trouble  recognising  the  distinctive  traits  of  the  British,  French,   American  or  Argentinian  Jews,  and  what  national  “baggage”  they  bring  to  the   table.  What  about  us?   This  may  seem  like  a  search  for  the  impos  sible  or  the  pointless,  but  it  intrigues  me,  nevertheless.  For  in  my  experience  of  over  40  years  of  mixing  with  Jews  from  around  the  world,  I’ve  had  no  trouble  quickly  recog  nising  the  distinctive  traits  of  the  British,  French,  American  or  Argentinian  Jews,  and  what  national  “baggage”  they  bring  to  the  table.  What  about  us?  Could  we  say,  for  example,  that  we’re  more  open-minded  and  less  hidebound  by  convention?  More,  or  less,  sensitive  to  cultural  and  religious  diver  sity?  More  adventurous,  or  more  conserva   tive  and  traditional?   Over  the  past  30  or  40  years,  a  handful  of  community  surveys  have  come  up  with  some  nuggets  about  the  way  Australian  Jews  see  their  identity  that  suggests  that  there’s  much  worth  exploring  at  that  indi  vidual  level  beyond  the  requirements  of  social  welfare  planning.   Yet  to  take  it  a  step  further,  beyond  psy  chology  and  the  formal  study  of  the  Australian  Jewish  personality,  what  really  interests  me  is  the  Australian  Jew  of  the  lit  erary  imagination.  In  short,  I’m  waiting  for  the  great  Australian  Jewish  novel,  whether  written  by  the  Saul  Bellow  of  Bondi,  the  Philip  Roth  of  Caulfield  or  the  Amos  Oz  of  St   Ives.   This  may  seem  like  an  eccentric  expecta  tion.  But  as  anyone  who’s  read  these  writers  knows,  their  depictions  (and  those  by  their  fellow  writers)  of  the  American  Jewish  intel  lectual,  professional  or  businessman,  or  of  the  Israeli  kibbutznik,  novelist,  soldier  or  mistress,  have  provided  us  with  an  under  standing  of  what  American  Jews  or  Israeli  Jews,  as  individuals,  are  really  like.  Moreover,  they’ve  done  it  in  ways  which  no  psychological  study  could  match.   Some  of  our  local  writers  —  the  short  sto  ries  of  Serge  Liberman,  Arnold  Zable  and   Morris  Lurie  come  to  mind  —  have  con  tributed  sketches  towards  such  an  imagina  tive  understanding.  But  the  full-length  novel  has  yet  to  appear.  When  it  does,  even  for  those  who  will  not  read  it,  it  will  change  the  very  nature  of  our  conversations  about  being  Australian  and  Jewish.   And  even  though  he  or  she  may  tarry,  I  await  that  writer  daily. ",2001-02-09
"  IT  had  to  happen  sooner  or  later  that  someone  would  create  a  virtual  synagogue.   According  to  the  Canadian  Jewish  News,  it’s  on  the  way,  and  when  it’s  online  (www.myShul.oigor.net  —  the  exact  domain  name  hasn’t  yet  been  determined),  it  hopes  to  become  the  world’s  first  global  Jewish  con  gregation,  offering  shut-ins,  the  isolated,  the  unaffiliat  ed  or  the  just  curious  the  chance  to  dick  their  way  to  the  synagogue  of  their  dreams.   Obviously,  the  cyber-shule  won’t  have  many  of  the  trappings  of  a  physical  synagogue;  there’s  no  virtual  schnapps  and  herring  (yet).  But  those  behind  the  effort  say  it’s  a  serious  attempt  to  bring  disinterested  and  disenchanted  Jews  into  the  fold,  using  21st-centu  ry  technology.  To  be  based  in  Toronto,  the  site  seeks  to  recreate  a  bricks-and-mortar  synagogue  in  the  ether  of  cyberspace.  Various  ‘rooms’  will  be  replicated,  includ  ing  a  sanctuary,  sodal  hall,  classroom,  library  —-  even  a  gift  shop.  myShul  will  tear  down  denominational  walls  by  welcoming  all  Jews  through  partidpation  in  real-time  prayer,  music,  study  and  chat  rooms.   NEW  YORK   7,1  Jewish  ^Week   THE  glut  of  court  cases  where  religious  issues  meet  secular  law—often  pitting  Jew  versus  Jew—is  seen  as  tied  to  a  growth  in  observance,  according  to  the  New   York  Jewish  Week.   The  newspaper  enumerates  many  cases  where  reli  gious  issues  have  gone  to  court.  In  Tenafly,  New  Jersey,  locals  are  battling  over  an  eruv,  while  in  Queens  there  was  a  fight  over  the  right  to  build  a  succah.  A  group  of  Orthodox  students  unsuccessfully  battled  Yale  to  avoid  living  in  a  mixed-sex  dorm  but,  conversely,  Yeshiva  University  was  successful  in  exduding  unmar  ried  couples  from  campus  housing.  In  two  cases  divorced  women  sued  rabbis  and  a  rabbinical  court  over  their  involvement  in  ritual  divorce  proceedings.   Other  cases,  focusing  on  zoning  regulations,  such  as  the  one  centring  on  the  huge  home  being  built  by  Orthodox  philanthropist  Ira  Rennert  on  Long  Island’s  tiny  East  End,  pit  Jew  against  Jew.  In  that  case,  neigh  bours,  many  of  them  non-Orthodox,  reacted  angrily  to  reports  that  part  of  the  estate  would  be  used  as  a  retreat  centre  for  Orthodox  Jews.   Increasingly,  it  seems,  observant  Jews  are  relying  on  secular  law  to  protect  their  adherence  to  religious  law.   ISRAEL  has  been  excluded  from  the  countries  approved  as  destinations  for  Britons  to  visit  with  guide  dogs  under  the  British  Government’s  pet  passport  scheme,  the  London  Jewish  Chmnicle  reports.

"  community   schools  M   I   Leanne  leUnte   ONE  problem  about  living  in  Southern  Sydney  is  the  fact  that  there  aren’t  any  Jewish  dayschools  around.  I  know  that  I  would  have  loved  to  attend  a  Jewish  school  where  all  my  friends  and  teach  ers  were  of  the  same  religion  as  me.  I  wouldn’t  have   Leanrte  BeHnfante   I  to  excuse  myself  from  cooking  m  Design  and   Technology  because  we  were  going  to  pre  pare  a  meal  that  consisted  of  bacon,  as  every  one  else  would  be  in  the  same  boat.   But  I  don’t  mind  too  much,  as  I  now  have  a  large  group  of  multicultural  friends,  from   whom  I  find  out  about  festivals  that  other  reli  gions  celebrate,  as  well  as  their  different   beliefs.   I’m  a  Year  10  student  at  Peakhurst  High  School,  which  is  in  Sydney’s  south-west.  The  only  other  Jewish  students  who  attend  Peakhurst  High  are  my  brother  Simon  and  Dotan  Kam,  who  are  both  in  Year  8.   |  All  three  of  us  used  to  attend  Cheder  at  |  Southern  Sydney  Synagogue,  where  we  were   taught  by  two  wonderful  teachers,  Rebhetzin  |  Shaina  Feldman  and  Fel  Prentice.  Mr  Prentice  1  recently  retired  after  teaching  there  for  ten  I  years,  but  he  and  Rebbetzin  Feldman  always  |  somehow  made  the  work  enjoyable,  making  I  me  want  to  go  back  ever  year.  Thanks  to   their  constant  enthusiastic  teaching  manner;  |  I  became  Dux  of  the  Cheder  for  two  years  run  |  ning,  not  to  boast  or  anything!   I  first  began  going  to  Cheder  in  1992  when  I  was  in  Year  1,  and  I  continued  to  be  educated  there  until  my  bat  mitzvah  in  1998.  Then  I  became  a  student  teacher,  along  with  Michael  Diamond,  who  had  just  had  his  bar  mitzvah,  and  helped  the  junior  class  students  with  their  Hebrew  skills.  Although  Simon  and  I  no  longer  attend  Cheder,  and  I  don’t  teach  any  more,  my  younger  sister,  Marissa,  who  is  in  Year  5  at  Penshurst  West  Primary  School,   still  does.   Even  though  not  many  Jewish  people  live  where  my  family  does,  we  still  get  involved  with  the  Jewish  community.  We  attend  Southern  Sydney  Synagogue  just  about  every  Shabbat,  where  my  father,  Garry,  is  the  sec  retary,  and  we  schlepp  out  to  Top  Ryde  every  Sunday  night  to  bowl  for  Maccabi.  Also,  whenever  there  is  a  B’nei  B’ritli  function  on,  my  very  lenient  parents,  Narelle  and  Garry,  drive  me  to  the  north  shore,  where  most  of  the  functions  are  held.   In  addition,  I  am  on  the  committee  for  the  2002  BBYO  Convention  and  come  into  con  tact  with  my  Jewish  friends  at  the  meetings.   So  even  though  I  don’t  live  in  the  Jewish  mainstream  (but  live  in  “Woop  Woop”,  as  most  people  probably  know  it  as),  it  doesn’t  mean  that  my  family,  or  any  other  family  from  the  south,  stray  from  the  community,  as  we  constantly  make  an  effort  to  be  included.   So  if  you  ever  come  across  someone  who  says  they’re  from  an  unknown  place  called  Peakhurst,  Blakehurst  or  even  Hurstville,  please  don’t  treat  them  any  differently  from  your  “eastie”  or  “northie”  friends,  because  we’re  all  the  same.

"  Title:   Author   Publisher.  Reviewer   The  Half-Jewish   Book:  A  Celebration  Daniel  Klein  and  Freke  Vuijst   Villard  Books,  305pp,  $45.95   Solon  Chervitz   HERE  is  much  to  celebrate  in  people  of  half-Jewish  background.  But  authors  JL  Daniel  Klein  and  Freke  Vuijst  are  per  haps  too  busy  celebrating  to  recognise  that  many  such  people  are  struggling  with  ques  tions  of  religious  and  ethnic  identity,  or  to  offer  them  serious  guidance  or  relief.  Indeed,  this  book  does  not  reveal  the  slightest  con  cern  for  what  it  all  might  mean  for  the  future  of  Judaism  and  the  Jewish  people.   Rather,  it  is  an  amalgamation  of  humorous  essays,  including  an  eye-opening  essay  on  half-Jewish  identity,  original  interviews  with  half-Jews,  illustrations,  holiday  cards,  menus,  poetry  and  song  lyrics,  paintings  and  photo  graphs  —  all  gathered  in  service  of  the  idea  that  a  half-Jew  is  Jewish  enough.  The  book  also  examines  the  often-misunderstood  histo  ry  of  half-Jews  in  the  Holocaust.  It  is  intelli  gent,  exuberant,  entertaining,  and  thought   provoking.   The  population  of  half-Jews  in  America  is  estimated  to  be  well  on  the  way  to  surpassing  the  population  of  full  Jews.  The  reality  is  that  the  rest  of  the  Western  world,  including  Australia,  is  not  that  far  behind.  And  with  this  population  shift  has  come  a  revolutionary  transformation  of  what  it  means  to  be  Jewish   or  half-Jewish.   The  idea  of  being  half-Jewish  was  prepos  terous  for  a  long  time,  and  a  generation  or  two   ago,  the  non-Jewish  partner  would  olten  nave  converted  to  Judaism  to  give  stability  to  both  the  relationship  and  family  life.  Today,  most  families  know  that  some  members  are  in  a  relationship  which  cam  only  be  described  as  half-Jewish.  That  does  not  mean  that  holy  days  are  not  observed,  but  rather,  that  two   sets  are  experienced.   Some  people  say  that  you  are  either  Jewish  or  not,  that  there’s  nothing  in  between.  The  authors,  however,  emphatically  disagree.  Half  Jews,  they  say,  have  become  a  unique  subcul  ture  of  people  who  draw  from  both  sides  of  their  heritage  and  synthesise  their  cultural  halves  into  a  remarkable  new  identity.   The  Half-Jewish  Book  celebrates  this  unique  identity  that  until  now  has  been  ignored,  maligned  and  misunderstood.  It  comes  in  many  forms.  There’s  half-Jewish  humour.  Half  Jewish/half-Catholic  Bill  Maher:  “I  come  from  a  mixed  religious  background  —  when  I  went  to  confession,  I  brought  a  lawyer  with  me.  And  there’s  half-Jewish  beauty  —  Gwynneth  Paltrow,  Joan  Collins  and  Jane  Seymour,  for  starters.  There  are  half-Jewish  writers  (Marcel  Proust,  J  D  Salinger)  and  half-Jewish  fictional  characters  created  by  authors  ranging  from  Philip  Roth  to  Salman  Rushdie.  And  don’t  for  get  the  extraordinary  number  of  people  who  discovered  as  adults  that  they  were  half  Jewish  and  embraced  their  new  found  double   heritage.  ......   Groucho  Marx  once  tried  to  make  light  of  the  situation  when  told  that  the  Country  Club  he  wished  to  join  did  not  accept  Jews.  He  asked  if  his  son  could  go  into  the  swimming  pool  up  to  his  waist  since  he  was  half-Jewish.  Many  who  hear  that  story  hear  the  pain  of  the  question  as  much  as  the  wit.   Writers  such  as  Klein  and  Vuijst  reject  that  the  “half-Jewish  problem”  is  the  tragic  product  of  intermarriage.  Rather,  they  celebrate  the  half-world  that  this  generates  and  the  confu  sion  it  engenders  in  so  many.   The  Half-Jewish  Book  is  a  fascinating  description  of  a  cultural,  intellectual  and  aes  thetic  mix  that  is  far  greater  than  the  sum  of  its  parts.  Even  when  one  disagrees  with  the  premise,  it  needs  to  be  read  and  understood.   Bl  Solon  Chervitz  is  a  librarian-cataloguer. ",2001-03-09
"  ‘Jewish  cardinal'  to  visit  Australia   Victor  Kleerekoper   JEWISH-born  Cardinal  Jean-Marie  Lustiger  —  believed  to  be  a  top  contender  to  succeed  Pope  John  Paul  II  as  the  next  Pope   —  will  visit  Australia  next  month.   He  will  deliver  the  Caritas  Helder  Camera  lecture  and  receive  an  honorary  doctor  of  laws  degree  from  Melbourne  University.   The  son  of  Polish  Jewish  migrants  to  France  whose  mother  died  at  Auschwitz,  Cardinal  Lustiger,  75,  converted  to  Catholicism  in  1940  and  during  the  war  was  part  of  the  Resistance  press  against  the   Nazis.   Despite  his  rise  through  the  Church,  he  has  never  ceased  to  identify  with  his  Jewish  background  and  has  often  repeated  the  fact   that  his  Jewish  name  is  Aaron  and  has  described  himself  as  a  “fulfilled  Jew”.   In  fact,  he  told  Nobel  laureate  Elie  Wiesel:  “I  feel  Jewish.  I  refuse  to  renounce  my  roots,  my  Jewishness.  How  could  I  betray  my  mother’s  memory?  It  would  be  cowardly  and  humiliating”.   Cardinal  Lustiger,  regarded  as  a  bridge  between  the  Jewish  people  and  Christians,  was  born  of  Jewish  parents  in  Paris  on  September  17,  1926.  His  parents  were  of  Polish  descent,  and  his  mother  was  killed  in  Auschwitz  in  1943  but  before  their  deportation  in  1940  ensured  that  their  son  was  taken  in  by  a  Catholic  family  in  Orleans.   So  taken  was  he  by  the  faith  of  his  foster  parents  that  he  converted  and  was  baptised  into  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  on  August  25,  1940  at  the  age  of  14.   As  a  college  student  after  the  war,  he  became  active  in  Young  Christian  Students  in  Paris  and  during  this  time  realised  a  vocation  to  the  priesthood.  Following  studies  at  The  Sorbonne,  where  he  obtained  degrees  in  the  humanities  and  philosophy,  as  well  as  religious  studies,  he  was  ordained  as  a  priest  on  April  17,1954.   After  more  studies  and  pastoral  work,  he  was  appointed  Cure  of  St  Jeanne  de  Chantal  in  Paris,  where  he  guided  parishioners,  emphasising  the  dignity  of  every  person  with  whom  he  came  into  contact  and  becoming  legendary  with  church-goers  everywhere  in  France  for  his  dynamic  preaching.   He  also  attracted  the  attention  of  Pope  John  Paul  II,  who  appointed  him  Bishop  of  Orleans  on  November  10,  1979.  Two  years  later,  the  Pope  elevated  him  to  succeed  Cardinal  Marty  as  Archbishop  of  Paris  on  January  31,  1981,  and  two  years  later  the  red  hat  was  bestowed  on  him,  making  him  a   Cardinal.  He  was  57.   Cardinal  Lustiger  has  played  a  major  role  in  key  Vatican  commissions  and  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  Christian-Jewish  dialogue  within  France  and  Europe  and  a  pivotal  figure  in  debate  on  immigration  issues.  He  has  been  particularly  outspoken  in  his  attacks  on  racism  and  the  rise  of  right-wing   extremism.   A  convinced  Europeanist,  he  has  lent  his  eloquence  to  the  cause  of  Franco-German  reconciliation,  founded  on  values  of  liberty  and  human  rights.   He  has  been  instrumental  in  adapting  the  French  Church  to  the  age  of  electronic  communication,  and  has  demonstrated  great  skill  in  using  the  media  to  establish  a  place  for  Christian  viewpoints  in  the  public   forum.   While  Cardinal  Lustiger  has  a  close  relationship  with  the  Pope,  his  “Jewishness”  has  upset  people  in  both  Jewish  and  Catholic  circles.   This  prompted  Elie  Wiesel  to  write  a  chapter  in  his  memoirs  And  the  sea  is  never  full,  titled  “Cardinal   Lustiger;            My   Friend”.   Cardinal  Jean-Marie  Lustiger     Wiesel  notes  that   the  prelate  did  not  conceal  his  Jewish  roots.  “On  the  contrary,  he  never  fails  to  claim  them.  He  repeats  that  his  Jewish  name  is  Aaron,  that  he  is  of  the  Jewish  people,”  he   wrote.   “A  proud  Christian,  he  assumes  his  Jewishness  and  does  so  without  the  slightest  complex.  In  fact,  he  describes  himself  as  a  “fulfilled  Jew”,  which  arouses  in  me  —  understandably  —  a  certain  uneasiness.  If  he,  a  Jew-turned  Christian  is  ‘fulfilled’,  does  that  mean  that  he  is  a  better  Jew  than  those  who  have  remained  Jews?     “I  feel  Jewish.  I  refuse  to  renounce   my  roots,  my  Jewishness.”     “I  think  of  the  tensions  and  conflicts  that  over  centuries  have  marked  the  relations  between  our  two  religions,  the  hateful  writings      of      the      church      fathers,      the  massacres      during      the      Crusades,    the  Inquisition,      the      pogroms,      the      public  humiliations.  I  think  of  the  silences  of  Pius  XII,  his  intercessions  with  Third  Reich  authorities  were  restricted  to  converted  Jews.  Only  they  mattered  to  him.  I  cannot  forget  this  deplorable  aspect  of  Holocaust  history,”  Wiesel  wrote.   He  recalled  that  the  Talmud  states  that  Yisrael  af  al  pi  shechata,  Yisrael  hu  (a  Jew,  even  a  sinner,  remains  a  Jew  and  wonders  how  one  classifies  “Aaron  Lustiger”.  The  two  meet  and  Elie  Wiesel  reports  asking  Cardinal  Lustiger  “Who  are  you?  Are  you  our  emissary  to  the  Christians,  or  theirs  to   us?”   While  the  Cardinal  is  not  the  first  to  have  converted  to  Christianity,  those  who  proceeded  him  never  claimed  to  be  “fulfilled  Jews”,  Elie  Wiesel  writes,  “but  he  insists  that  having  been  born  a  Jew,  he  will  die  a   Jew.”   Wiesel  says  Abraham  understood  that  Judaism  means  separation  and  choice,  and  that  one  cannot  belong  to  two  religions.   Cardinal  Lustiger  will  also  visit  Sydney,  and  will  speak  at  the  State  Parliament  Theatrette  on  August  8.  Former  Australian  Prime  Minister  Gough  Whitlam  and  NSW  Chief  Justice  Jim  Spigelman  will  be  in   attendance.

"  Predominance  of  Jewish  champions   “ALL  games  are  bad,  except  chess,”   rabbis  declare.   It  would  be  of  some  interest  to   explore  whether  present-day  rabbis  would  uphold  this  declaration,  uttered  by  the  rabbis  of  Cremona  in  1575.   Although  Jewish  interest  in  chess  can  be  dated  back  to  the  son  of  Rabbi  Saul  in  the  9th  century,  chess  remains  extremely  popular  in  the  Jewish  com  munity.  Indeed,  the  success  of  Jews  in  chess  is  somewhat  of  a  phenomenon.   Jews  make  up  less  than  one  per  cent  of  the  population,  yet  over  half  of  the  chess  world  champions  have  been  Jewish.  Recent  world  champions  and  grandmasters  have  been  dispropor  tionately  represented  by  Jews  such  as  Korchnoi,  Spassky  and  Bobby  Fischer,  who  is  Jewish  despite  making  dis  paraging  remarks  about  Jews.   Emmanuel  Lasker,  regarded  as  the  most  complete  player  of  all  time,  was  the  grandson  of  a  rabbi  and  the  son  of   a  cantor.  Judit  Polgar,  the  greatest  female  chess  player,  is  Jewish.  The  father  of  the  greatest  player  of  all  time,  Garry  Kasparov,  is  Jewish.   The  Jewish  chess  tradition  contin  ues  as  Israel  is  regarded  as  a  power  house  in  chess;  it  is  ranked  fifth  in  the  world  and  is  second  only  to  Iceland  in  grandmasters  per  head.   What  could  be  the  reason  for  the  apparent  Jewish  talent  for  chess?  Is  it   coincidence?  Do  Jews  have  an  innate  affinity  for  chess?  Some  have  looked  for  deeper  insights.  Jews  have  tradi  tionally  loved  studying  and  learning,  and  a  popular  theory  is  that  chess  study  is  similar  to  Talmud  study.  Chess  legends  who  were  educated  in  yeshivot,  such  as  Aron  Nimzovitch,  Samuel  Reshevsky  and  Akiva   Rubinstein,  have  been  cited  as  exam  ples.   The  likelihood  is  that  we  will  never  know  the  exact  reason.  What  is  cer  tain,  however,  is  that  as  chess  is  the  second-most  popular  game  in  the  world  (after  soccer),  Jews  can  give  themselves  a  collective  pat  on  the  back  for  their  disproportionate  achievements  in  this  ancient  pursuit   Bronstein  v  Sochi:  White  to  mm®  &amp;  win.

"  Young,  Jewish  in  Sydney   Chairtai  Abithol   AT  27,  Debbie  Hill  was  aware  of   divisions  within  the  Jewish  community.   “I  realised  I  had  lots  of  knots,”  she  says.  “I’d  look  at  other  Jews  and  think  ‘they’re  Orthodox,  I’m  Reform’.”   Her  perspective  changed  dramatically   when  she  embarked  on  a  course  titled  “Curriculum  to  Living”  as  part  of  the  Landmark  Education  Corporation  leadership  program.   “I  finally  got  to  a  point  where  I  realised  that  Judaism  for  each  person  is  entirely  individual,”  Hills  says  in  retrospect.  “For  me,  it’s  Shabbat  dinner  with  my  family;  for  a  friend  of  mine,  it  means  belonging  to  a  Maccabi  sports  team.”   To  celebrate  these  differences,  Hill  decided,  as  part  of  her  course  project,  to  stage  an  art  exhibition  with  the  theme  “What  it  means  to  be  young,  Jewish  and  living  in  Sydney”.  Although  she  had  never   considered  herself  creative,  she  thought  it  would  be  “a  fantastic  way  to  express  myself  and  have  other  people  join  in.”   The  exhibition  will  be  held  at  Hakoah  Club  on  Sunday,  December  9   between  11am  and   5.00pm.

IF  Hitler  wanted  to  get  an  anti-Jewish  message  across  in  Australia,  he  could  put  it  to  music,  but  he  would  not  be  allowed  to  do  it  in  this  country,  NSW  MP  Reverend  Fred  Nile  says.   However,  Jewish  leaders  will  not  lobby  the  government  to  deny  entry  to  controversial  American  singer  Marshall  Mathers.   Known  as  Eminem,  Mr  Mathers  has  created  controversy  with  his  provocative  lyrics,  and  has  been  accused  of  attacking  women  and   homosexuals  in  his  music.   His  music  includes  references  to  suicide  and  rape,  and  the  Women’s  Electoral  Lobby  and  the  Australian  Family  Association  have  called  for  legislation  that  would  prevent  minors  attending  the  concert.   Mr  Mathers  is  on  probation  for  firearms  offences  in  the  United  States  and  is  facing  legal  action  by  his  mother.   Reverend  Nile  has  called  on  Immigration   Minister  Phil  Ruddock  to  block  Mr  Mathers’   visa  application,  describing  him  on  Channel  Seven  as  a  preacher  of  hate  who  is  not  welcome  in  Australia.  Should  Mr  Mathers  be   allowed  to  perform  in  Australia,  Rev  Nile  said,  concert  tickets  should  be  restricted  to  adults.   But  he  was  not  comparing  Mr  Mathers  to  Hitler,  he  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.  “I  was  saying  that  if  Hitler  was  here  and  wanted  to  attack  the  Jews  using  rap,  would  we  let  him  just  because  there’s  music  behind  his  words?  No  we  wouldn’t.  We  stopped  David  Irving  coming  to  Australia  because  it  would  have   been  offensive.”   An  opponent  of  the  Gay  and  Lesbian  Mardi  Gras,  Rev  Nile  told  Channel  Seven  that  Mr  Mathers  preaches  hate  against  women  and  homosexuals.  He  also  warned  of  the  effect  the  rapper  could  have  on  teenagers.   “We  have  the  highest  suicide  rate  for  teenagers  in  Australia;  I  don’t  believe  his  lyrics  should  be  going  into  the  minds  of  impressionable  kids.  This  guy’s  promoting  an  anti-social  way  of  life.  We  don’t  need  him.”   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Nina  Bassat  said  while  the  ECAJ  had  opposed  the  entry  of  Holocaust  revisionist  David  Irving,  it  had  not  discussed  Eminem.   “The  opposition  to  Irving  was  on  the  basis   of  a  criminal  conviction  and  his  likelihood  of  breaching  racial  vilification  legislation,”  she  said.  “I  don’t  believe  this  is  the  issue  here.”   The  ECAJ  would  get  involved  only  if  it  felt  that  the  issue  would  affect  the  Jewish  community  or   that  there  would  be   infringement  of  racial   Marshal  Mathers,  better  known  as  Eminem.   hatred  law,  she  added.   Jewish  punk  band  Yidcore  lead  singer  Bram  Presser  supported  Eminem’s  entry.  “He  is  the  best  contemporary  American  cultural  satirist  around.  A  lot  of  people  aren’t  in  on  the  joke.  They  don’t  realise  that  he  is  tongue-in-cheek.”   B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commission  executive  director  Danny  Ben-Moshe  said  he  had  faith  that  Mr  Ruddock  would  exercise  proper  judgment  in  deciding  whether  to  allow  Mr  Mathers’  entry.   The  ADC  opposes  the  entry  of  individuals  who  “sow  racial,  religious  hatred  and  division  in  the  community”,  he  said.  It  would  consider  supporting  minorities  which  opposed  Eminem’s  entry  if  it  was  approached.  But  “we  are  not  seeking  to  become  the  anti-defamation  body  of  every  minority”.   A  spokesperson  for  Frontier  Touring  promoter  Michael  Gudinski  said  he  was   confident  that  Eminem  would  be  allowed  in. ",2001-07-13
"  WASHINGTON  —  The  American  Reform  and  Conservative  movements  is  seeking  clemency  for  mass  terrorist  Timothy  McVeigh.   He  was  scheduled  to  be  put  to  death  by  lethal  injection  this  week,   but  his  execution  has  been   postponed  to  June  11.   McVeigh  lulled  168  people  —  19  of  them  children  —  when  he  bombed  a  building  in  Oklahoma  City  in  1995.   In  a  letter  to  US  President  George  Bush,  the  Jewish  groups  said  they  were  concerned  at  the  US’  imperfect  justice  system  and  the  fact  that  innocent  people  could  be  executed.  “When  the  government  responds  to  violence  with  violence,  it  breeds  more  violence,”  it  said.  It  called  for  a  moratorium  on  all  executions.   Many  Jewish  organisations  are  opposed  to  the  death  penalty,  citing  possible  innocence  of  those  on  Death  Row,  possible  racial  or  economic  bias  and  whether  the  accused  had  competent  legal  representation.   None  of  those  factors  was  at  play  in  the  McVeigh  case,  but  “you  can’t  be  for  it  part  of  the  time  and  against  it  part  of  the  time”,  Reform  president  Rabbi  Eric  Yoffie  said.   In  a  recent  survey  by  Amos  —  a  Jewish  social  action  coalition  —  less  than  half  of  the  1002  Jews  polled  said  they  favoured  a  moratorium  on  capital  punishment.  Some  who  opposed  the  death  penalty  were  in  favour  of  the  punishment  for  McVeigh  because  of  the  severity  of  his  crime.   Orthodox  Union  president  Harvey  Blitz  said  the  movement  does  not  want  to  abolish  the  death  penalty,  but  supports  a  moratorium  because  of  concerns  about  innocent  people  being  executed.  But  it  did  not  oppose  McVeigh’s  execution  —  in  part  because  he  confessed  to  the   bombing.   JIA ",2001-05-18

It’s  taken  20  years  to  grow  to  its  current  size  of  2000  peo  ple.  People  from  20  countries  have  asked  ‘Why  don’t  we  have  one  in  our  country?’  Only  one  town  has  had  the  energy  to  do  it,  and  that’s  Sydney.   “We  created  a  program  where  any  body  can  offer  a  session.  We  couldn’t  guarantee  anyone  would  turn  up,  but  we’d  provide  a  room.  We  also  provid  ed  child  care;  the  idea  that  we  would  enable  women  to  attend  was  unheard  of.  What  was  also  revolu  tionary  was  the  absence  of  hierarchy  —  nobody  gets  a  title  at  Limmud,  nobody  is  told  to  learn.”   This  commitment  to  adult  educa  tion  is  a  challenge  facing  World   Jewry,  Mr  Lawton  said.  “We  expend  resources  on  children  and  the  elder  ly,  but  the  majority  of  our  communi  ty  are  adults;  if  we  don’t  get  them  right,  we  won’t  be  able  to  fund  our  elderly  or  teach  our  children.”   Mr  Lawton  also  has  a  passion  for  the  dramatic  arts.  “My  interests  in  Judaism  and  performing  arts  have  always  run  parallel.  I  would  have  loved  to  be  an  actor,  but  couldn’t  do  that  and  keep  Shabbat.  I  decided  as  a  consolation  to  go  into  teaching.  I  don’t  regret  it  because  being  an  actor  was  a  dimension  of  who  I  am  and  being  a  Jew  is  the  essence  of  who  I   am.  You  mustn’t  sacrifice  an  essence  for  a  dimension.”   Chairman  of  Tzedek,  which  sup   ports  projects  in  the  Third  World,  and  a  Criminal  Court  magistrate,  Mr  Lawton  advocates  involvement  in  the  world  outside  the  Jewish  com  munity.  “I  believe  passionately  in  the  Jewish  responsibility  to  play  a  part  in  the  wider  world.  We  have  to  con  tribute  and  not  isolate  ourselves.”   Part  of  his  image  as  an  “alternate”  Jew  stems  from  his  approach  to  get  ting  the  job  done,  he  acknowledges.  “I’ve  cultivated  a  reputation  as  some  body  who  comes  at  things  from  left  field  —  not  to  dismantle  tradition,  but  to  re-invigorate  it.  We’ve  got  a  product,  Judaism,  which  virtually  sells  itself—but  you’ve  got  to  get  the  customer,  and  we  are  singularly  bad  at  decorating  our  shop-window.  I  don’t  think  I’m  exciting,  it’s  just  that  the  Jewish  world  is  less  so.”   ■  Lawton’s  Jewish  tour,  page  33 ",2001-06-15

You  are  at  a   meeting  at  work  with  three  layers  of  management  plus  your  colleagues,  discussing  the  managing  director  of  an  overseas  company  who  is  coming  to  Aus  tralia.  Suddenly,  out  of  the  blue,  one  of  your  colleagues  pipes  up:  “You  know,  he’s  a  four-be-two.”  “A  what?”  you  ask.  “A  four-be  two!  A  Jew  —like  you!”  he  barks.   Doesn’t  happen?  Yes  it  does.  It  happened  to  me  right  here  in  “tol  erant,  multiracial”  Sydney,  in  a  company  with  an  antiracist  policy.   I  was  outraged.  I  wanted  retri  bution.  I  wanted  an  apology.  Yes,  I  did  ask  for  it,  in  writing  with  copies  to  everyone  present.  Yes,  you’ve  guessed  it  —  lam  still  waiting.   All  my  non-Jewish  friends  said,  “This  is  un-Australian  and  against  the  law.  He  must  apolo  gise!”  My  Jewish  friends  were  not  so  sure.  Some  said  they  “under  stood”  my  anger.  Others  demurred  that  it  was  an  “old  Aussie  expression”  or  a  figure  of  speech.   Now,  I  have  “contacts”  in  the  community,  so  I  turned  to  them.  One  said  not  to  bother,  “It  takes  two  years.”  What  takes  two  years,  finding  out  how  to  go  about  getting  an  apology?  I  won  dered.

More  promises.   Next  call  was  to  JewishCare,  who  sent  me  back  to  the  Board  of   Deputies,  but  also  promised  to   call  back.   I  then  called  the  NSW  Anti  Discimination  Board,  where  the  person  who  picked  up  the  phone  explained  the  steps  I  can  take  to  get  an  apology,  outlined  the  law   and  directed  me  to  their  website  for  more  details.   By  the  time  JewishCare  called  back,  I  had  rephrased  my  ques  tions  and  asked:  “Is  there  a  point  of  contact  within  the  Jewish  com  munity  for  people  who  experi  ence  antisemitic  abuse?”  He  said  the  Board  of  Deputies,  but  then  went  on  to  say  that  JewishCare  can  help  with  sensitivity  training  for  the  company  and  free  legal  advice,  should  the  need  arise.

Goodman,  who  plays  for  the  Tow  son  University  basketball  team,  skipped  the  first  game-and-a-half  as  his  Baltimore  university  competed  in  the  America  East  tournament  for  a  berth  in  the  larger,  prestigious  NCAA  tourney.   To  those  who  know  the  Goodman  story,  it  didn’t  come  as  a  surprise.  An  Orthodox  Jew  who  wears  his  kipa  on  court,  Goodman  first  made  headlines  a  few  years  ago  when  the  University  of  Maryland  —  where  Goodman  seemed  likely  to  play—said  it  would  try  not  to  schedule  any  basketball  games  on  Shabbat  during  his  tenure   with  the  team.   The  subject  of  a  profile  in  Sports  Illustrated  magazine,  Goodman,  dubbed  “the  Jewish  Jordan”,  became  a  media  darling.   After  he  injured  his  knee,  howev  er,  the  University  of  Maryland  appeared  to  back  down  from  its  scholarship  commitment,  and  the  team  and  the  player  parted  company.   Playing  in  the  less  prestigious  America  East  tournament  with  Tow  son,  Goodman  suffered  some  grow  ing  pains  this  year.  He  averaged  only  six  points  and  four  assists  per  game  as  his  team  struggled  to  a  record  of  11-16  and  finished  seventh  in  the  league  during  the  regular  season.  But  then,  as  the  season  progressed,  Goodman  moved  into  the  team’s  starting  line-up  as  point  guard.   Goodman  has  “court  vision,  a  feel  for  the  game  and  the  ability  to  make  everyone  better”,  Towson  coach  Mike  Jaskulski  says.   The  player  showed  glimpses  of  these  strengths  in  his  limited  action  over  a  recent  weekend.  Without  the  6-foot-3,  155-pound  Goodman,  Tow  son  barely  squeaked  by  in  its  first  round  game  against  Hartford,  winning  65-62.   That  set  up  a  match  on  a  recent  Saturday  evening  against  heavily  favoured  Delaware.  The  organisers   Rising  star  Tamlr  Goodman...  won't  play  on  Snaboat.   refused  to  switch  the  game  to  a  later  time  slot  because  it  would  have  forced  Delaware,  the  No  2  seed  in  the  tournament,  to  play  with  less  rest  on  the  Sunday  if  it  defeated  Towson.   The  Tigers  struggled,  falling  behind  by  15  at  halftime.  Goodman  arrived  at  the  stadium  at  halftime  after  Shabbat  ended.  The  gangly  guard  quickly  gave  the  team  a  spark,  hitting  a  three-point  shot  and  provid  ing  a  perfect  pass  that  led  to  a  slam  dunk  —  and  oohs  and  aahs  from  the  crowd.  But  there  were  no  miracles.  Towson  fell  66-51.   If  the  team’s  record  wasn’t  up  to  par,  the  Goodman  experiment  appar  ently  was.   Outside  the  tournament,  Towson  played  no  games  between  sundown  on  Friday  and  Saturday,  and  Good  man  was  excused  from  Saturday  afternoon  practices.   Once,  when  the  team  was  on  the  road  and  sundown  was  approaching,  Goodman  got  out  of  the  team  van  and  walked  three  blocks  to  a  house  where  he  was  staying  for  Shabbat.  “They  see  me  fasting  on  some  days,  and  they  learn  about  Havdalah  and  kosher  food,”  he  says.  “It’s  a  great  opportu  nity  to  teach  them  about  Judaism.”   Jaskulski,  who  now  keeps  a  Jewish  calendar  on  his  wall,  agrees.  “As  the  guys  see  Tamir  practise  religion,  their  respect  for  him  grows,”  he  says.   Goodman  also  says  he  enjoyed  rooming  with  fellow  first-year  player  Mohammed  Fofana,  a  Muslim  from  Mali  in  Africa.  The  two  don’t  talk  much  politics,  but  stick  to  basketball.   “When  I  put  on  my  tefillin  in  the  morning  to  daven,  he’s  very  respect  ful.  He’s  probably  listening  to  rap  star  Tupac  Shakur,”  Goodman  says.   J1A ",2001-03-16

"  UNIVERSITY  of  New  South  Wales  student  Adam  Hochroth  will  stand  for  election  to  the  UNSW  Student  Union  Board  next  week.   “It’s  important  for  Jews  to  be  in  positions  of  influence  in  secular  bodies,”  Mr  Hochroth  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.  “And  when  it  comes  to  the  UNSW  Union,  there  needs  to  be  more  Jewish  involvement.”   Mr  Hochroth’s  interest  in  student  politics  was  ignited  earlier  this  year  when  the  UNSW  Student  Guild  Council  passed  a  motion  con  doning  the  Palestinian  violence  in  the  Middle  East  and  lending  support  to  a  proposed  Palestinian  state.  He  does  not  want  to  see  the  same  situation  occur  in  the  UNSW  Union.   “The  Guild  claims  to  be  a  representative  student  organisation,  yet  it  is  clearly  only  rep  resentative  of  a  minority  group  who  appear  to  be  anti-Zionist,”  he  said.

"  Examining  the  Jewish-Christian  relationship   Title:  Constantine’s  Sword:   The  Church  and  the  Jews:  A  History   Author:  James  Carroll   Publisher.  Houghton  Mifflin  Co,   2001,  $22.40  (US),  576pages   Reviewer:  Calev  Ben-David   THE  story  of  how  the  humble  rock  on   which  St  Peter  once  stood  turned  into  the  world  power  known  as  the  Vatican  is  essentially  tied  into  the  Church’s  evolving  attitude  toward  Jews  and  Judaism.   James  Carroll  begins  his  provocative  and  exhaustive  study  of  the  relationship  between  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  and  the  Jewish  people  by  contemplating  the  large  wooden  cross,  more  than  six  metres  high,  erected  by  Polish  Catholics  during  the  1980s  battle  over  a  controversial  Carmelite  nunnery  estab  lished  outside  the  gates  of  Auschwitz.   “What  does  the  cross  of  Jesus  Christ  mean   at  such  a  place?  What  does  it  mean  to  Jews?  What  does  it  mean  to  Christians?  Or  to  Polish  Catholics?  Or  to  those  for  whom  reli  gious  symbols  are  empty?  What  does  the  cross  there  signal  about  our  understanding  of  the  past?  And  what  of  the  future?”   Carroll  is  not  interested  in  easy  answers.   To  even  begin  addressing  such  questions,  he  believes  one  needs  an  understanding  of  what  place  the  symbol  of  the  cross  occupies  in  Christian  theology.  That,  in  turn,  requires  knowing,  at  least  in  broad  strokes,  the  his  torical  development  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  which  more  than  any  other  branch  of  Christianity  puts  the  crucifixion  of  Jesus  as  the  central  event  in  its  belief  structure.   Thus  Constantine’s  Sword,  although  subti  tled  The  Church  and  the  Jews,  is  about  far  more  than  even  that  tremendous  subject.  At  times,  as  Carroll  relates  the  story  of  the  ide  ological,  political  and  personal  struggles  that  have  rent  the  Church  over  the  centuries,  the  Jews  disappear  from  this  narrative  for  pages  at  a  stretch.  But  as  Carroll  rightly  argues,  the  story  of  how  the  rock  on  which  St  Peter  stood  turned  into  the  Vatican  is  essentially  tied  into  the  Church’s  evolving  attitude  toward  Jews  and  Judaism  over  two  millen   nI  As  the  child  of  a  devout  American-Catholic   family,  who  studied  under  the  Jesuits  at  Georgetown  University  and  spent  six  years  as  a  priest  before  hanging  up  his  robes  to  become  a  novelist  (whose  books  bear  com   parison  with  the  Catholic  pop-fiction  of  the  better-known  writer-priest,  Father  Andrew  Greeley),  Carroll  is  uniquely  positioned  to  deliver  a  work  on  this  subject  that  is  both  academically  sound  and  easily  accessible  to  the  average  reader.   What’s  more,  whenever  possible,  he  deftly  weaves  into  this  book  the  personal  story  of  his  autobiographical  search  for  faith  and  meaning  —  starting  with  his  first  exposure  to  antisemitism,  when  he  was  disappointed  to  learn  that  his  childhood  Jewish  friend  would  not  be  able  to  play  at  the  restricted  Virginia  country  club  to  which  his  family  belonged.   Carroll  starts  his  historical  survey  by  examining  the  New  Testament,  which,  like  many  modern  liberal  Christian  scholars,  he  sees  as  reaffirming  the  essential  Jewishness  of  Jesus  that  both  Christians  and  Jews  have  so  strongly  sought  to  deny.  He  points  out  that  the  theological  conflicts  between  the  earliest  Christians  and  their  Jewish  brethren  were  in  fact  no  worse  than  those  between  Jews  themselves.  He  comes  to  the  defence  of  Saint  Paul,  who,  he  argues  “so  often  identi  fied  as  a  culprit  in  the  Jewish-Christian  con  flict,  was  in  fact  a  victim  of  it.  So  many  of  the  later  phases  of  the  Christian  assault  on  Jews  would  be  carried  out  in  his  name,  yet  in  this   first  phase,  he  saw  that  dynamic  taking  shape  and  tried  to  stop  it.”   The  real  turning-point  in  Christian-Jewish  relations  comes  when  Roman  Emperor  Constantine  is  converted  to  Christianity  in  the  fourth  century  and  makes  that  faith  the  official  religion  of  his  empire.  This  conjoining  of  religious  faith  with  temporal  power  (the  “sword”  of  the  book’s  title)  would  prove,  in  Carroll’s  view,  problematic  for  both  Christians  and  Jews,  often  fatally  so  for  the  latter.  Compounding  the  problem  was  Constantine’s  initiation  of  the  development  of  the  Nicene  Creed,  which  elevated  the  cru  cifixion  of  Jesus  (including  the  alleged  Jewish  complicity  in  that  act)  as  the  central  event  in  the  Church’s  theology  of  redemp  tion.  “Can  it  be  a  coincidence,”  asks  Carroll,  “that  attacks  on  Jews,  both  rhetorical  and  physical,  become  a  notable  pattern  of  Christian  behaviour  only  after  the  cult  of  the  cross  is  established?”   In  388  CE,  a  Christian  mob  in  Milan  burned  down  a  synagogue  —  an  act  defended  by  the  local  bishop,  Saint  Ambrose,  who  declared  a  Jewish  house  of  worship  “a  haunt  of  infidels,  a  home  of  the  impious,  a  hiding  place  of  mad  men,  under  the  damnation  of  God  himself”.   But  Carroll  notes  that  other  Church  fathers  took  a  more  complex,  merciful  view  of  the  Jews.  Although  St  Augustine  wrote  that  “the  Lord  Christ  distinguished  between  His  faithful  ones  and  His  Jewish  enemies,  as  between  Light  and  Darkness”,  this  hugely  influential  early  Christian  philosophy  argued  against  anti-Jewish  violence,  if  only  because  they  deserved  continued  existence  as  “wit  nesses  to  the  prophecies  which  were  given  beforehand  concerning  Christ.”   Alas,  as  this  book  sadly  recounts  in  dis  heartening  detail,  Augustine’s  words  were  too  often  disregarded  by  later  Church  lead  ers  and  lay  Catholics,  especially  during  the  Crusades  when  entire  Jewish  communities  in  Europe  were  massacred  by  rampaging  holy   warriors.   The  problem,  as  Carroll  argues  in  a  chap  ter  aptly  titled  “The  Dainger  of  Ambivalence”,  rests  with  the  mixed  message  sent  out  by  the  Church  leadership  over  the  centuries  —  occasionally  condemning  specific  acts  of  anti-Jewish  violence,  while  still  preaching  “the  dominant  Christian  theology  of  Jesus,  not  only  as  the  enemy  of  the  Jewish  people,  but  as  the  Son  of  God  who  obliterates  the  integrity  of  all  the  other  ways  to  God  ”   In  the  latter  half  of  Constantine’s  Sword,   Carroll  focuses  on  the  growing  struggle  between  the  tradition-bound  Church  and  the  forces  of  modernism  that  have  swept  through  Europe  in  the  past  few  centuries  —  rationalism,  socialism,  Marxism  and  even  modern  capitalism.  Again,  without  under  standing  these  chapters  of  Church  history,  it  is  impossible  to  make  sense  of  the  paradox  of  the  Vatican’s  current  leader,  the  remark  able  John  Paul  II.   On  the  one  hand,  Carroll  rightly  hails  him  as  the  Pope  who  has  done  more  than  any  of  his  predecessors  to  heal  the  breach  between  Catholics  and  Jews.  On  the  other,  as  a  staunch  defender  of  Church  dogma,  John  Paul  II  has  pushed  for  the  canonisation  of  such  staunch  Vatican  conservatives  as  Pius  IX  and  Pius  XII  —  even  though  the  former  was  a  19th-century  reactionary  who  sanc  tioned  the  kidnapping  of  a  Jewish  child  raised  as  a  Catholic,  and  the  latter  has  been  criticised  for  his  deafening  silence  during  the  Holocaust.  While  John  Paul  II’s  landmark  statement  last  March  decried  “the  behaviour  of  those  who  in  the  course  of  history  have  caused  these  children  of  yours  [Jews]  to  suf  fer”,  Carroll  argues  “it  was  possible  to  hear  that  apology  as  regret  for  behaviour  that  was  inconsistent  with  core  Church  teaching,  instead  of  set  in  motion  by  it”.   What  is  really  needed,  says  the  author,  is  a  Church  declaration  that  “while  Judaism  exists  without  essential  reference  to  Christianity,  the  reverse  is  not  the  case  ...  The  Jews  remain  the  Chosen  People  of  God.  The  Jewish  rejection  of  Jesus  as  the  Son  of  God  is  an  affirmation  of  faith  that  Christians  must  respect.”  And  this  statement  must  be  confirmed  by  nothing  less  than  a  “Vatican  III”  council  that  will  “reorder  the  Church’s  rela  tionship  to  the  ‘troubling  texts’  that  deny  all   of  this.”   Such  an  approach  would  no  doubt  raise  the  hackles  of  Catholic  traditionalists,  and  sounds  unrealistically  utopian,  given  the  Vatican’s  increasingly  conservative  policy  on  Church  dogma.  Still,  that  informed,  commit  ted  (if  somewhat  out  of  the  mainstream)  Catholics  like  Carroll  are  willing  to  press  for  such  change,  holds  out  the  hope  that  one  day  the  Church  will  be  redeemed  from  all  the  suffering  that  its  insistence  on  Christian  redemption  has  inflicted  on  the  Jewish  peo  ple  for  ages.

"  Jewish  support  for  Bush  soars   Sharon  Sambas*   WASHINGTON  —  Jewish  support  for  US  President  George  Bush  has  climbed  sharply,  but  whether  it  will  translate  into  sustained  support  for  the  Republican  Party  is  up  for   debate.   Jews  give  the  President  an  approval  rating  of  nearly  80  per  cent,  according  to  a  survey  released  by  the  Republican  Jewish  Coalition.   If  the  election  were  held  today,   more  Jews  would  vote  for  Bush  —  42  per  cent  —  than  for  former  Democrat  presidential  candidate  A1  Gore,  who  received  39  per  cent.   In  the  2000  election,  Gore  received  79  per  cent  of  the  Jewish  vote  to  Bush’s  19.   Republican  activists  were  quick  to  hail  the  results  as  a  shift  of  Jewish  sentiment,  but  Democrats  cast  doubt  on  the  survey’s  significance.   Republican  pollster  Frank  Luntz,  who  conducted  the  poll,  said  the  survey  suggests  a  possible  political  realignment  within  the  Jewish  community.   Observers  across  the  political  spectrum  did  not  find  Bush’s  approval  ratings  surprising,  since  every  president  is  buoyed  in  times  of  national  crisis.   Bush  has  gained  favour  in  the  eyes  of  American  Jews  with  his  war  on  terrorism,  his  support  for  Israel  and  his  pressure  on  the  Palestinians  to  crack  down  on  terror.   But  some  say  that  makes  the  survey  an  unfair  snapshot  of  a  president  at  his  peak,  rather  than  a  clear  indication  of  a  political  shift.   us  President  George  W  Bush   Mark  Mellman,  a  Democratic  pollster,  called  the  realignment  a  “gross  exaggeration”.   “Every  year  we  hear  the  magic  word  ‘realignment’,”  said  Ira  Forman,  executive  director  of  the  National  Jewish  Democratic  Council.  Aspects  of  the  survey  were  “hokum”  and  sounded  “bogus”,  he  said.   Among  the  key  findings:   •  two-thirds  approve  of  the  way  Bush  has  handled  US-Israeli  relations;   °  almost  80  per  cent  approve  of  his  policy  towards  Yasser  Arafat;   •  27  per  cent  said  his  performance  makes  them  more  likely  to  vote  for  other  Republicans,   28  per  cent  said  less  likely  and  35  per  cent  said  no  difference.   Luntz  said  the  results  show  that  Republicans  need  an  active  and  sustained  outreach  in  the  Jewish   community,  and  noted  that  young  Jewish  voters  are  “up  for  grabs”.   It  was  not  clear  what  impact  Bush’s  present  support  might  mean  for  the  future  of  his  presidency  or  the  Republican  Party.   Democrats  should  be  warned  but  not  alarmed  by  the  survey,  said  Hyman  Bookbinder,  former  American  Jewish  Committee  representative.  Bush  deserves  to  gain  in  the  Jewish  community  because  he  has  done  the  right  thing  regarding  Israel  and  the  war  on  terrorism,  but  it  is  too  soon  to  count  votes  for  the  next  elections,  he  said.   Bookbinder  questioned  favourable  ratings  for  Bush’s  domestic  agenda,  saying  people  are  not  focused  on  domestic  issues.  Republican  positions  on  issues  such  as  abortion  and  school  prayer  have  alienated  Jewish  voters  in  the  past.   In  the  survey,  42  per  cent  approve  of  Bush’s  handling  of  domestic   issues  such  as  education  and  social   security,  but  47  per  cent  disapprove.  In  the  past,  only  20-25  per  cent  of  Jewish  voters  have  supported  a  Republican  domestic  agenda,  according  to  the  pollsters.   The  Jewish  community  has  been  moving  in  a  conservative  direction  for  some  time,  says  Murray  Friedman  of  the  Feinstein  Centre  of  American  Jewish  History  at  Temple   University.

"  IS  International   Israel’s  firsi   JERUSALEM:  Arab  Druse  Labour  Knesset  Member  Sallah  Tarif  will  become  Israel’s  first  non-Jew  to  serve  as  a  minister  when  Prime  Minister  elect  Ariel  Sharon  presents  his  gov   ernment.   Tarif  finished  fourth  in  the  voting  of  the  Labour  Party’s  central  commit  tee,  earning  him  one  of  the  party’s  two  ministries  without  portfolio.   Sailah  Tarif   Tarif,  who  threatened  to  leave  the  party  if  he  were  not  chosen,  noted  the  significance  of  his  victory,  saying  he  is  glad  that  a  Druse  will  join  the  govern  ment,  but  he  was  sorry  it  took  so  long.  “This  is  a  very  historic  and  emotional  event  that  I  have  waited  a  long  time  for,”  a  joyous  Tarif  said.  “I  am  glad  I  am  being  given  an  opportunity  to  serve  my  country  and  help  bring  about  peace  with  the  Palestinians.”   Tarif  expressed  interest  in  using  his  position  to  work  on  behalf  of  the  advancement  of  minorities  and  improving  relations  with  Israel’s  Arab  neighbours.   “My  mission  is  very  hard,  because  I  have  got  negative  reactions  from  Arabs  about  joining  a  coalition  with  the  extremist  right,”  he  said.  “I  will  work  for  a  new  policy  toward  minori  ties,  especially  the  Arab  people.  I  know  all  their  problems,  their  treat  ment,  that  the  budget  does  not  give  them  equal  rights.  The  time  has  also  come  for  the  country’s  leaders  to  use   Israeli  Arabs  to  help  the  peace  process.  An  Israeli  minister  going  to  Cairo  and  Amman,  talking  Arabic,  and  saying  that  there  is  new  willingness  for  peace  in  Israel  will  make  an  important  impression”   Tarif  served  as  a  captain  in  Israel’s  Paratroop  Brigade  and  has  been  in  the  Knesset  since  1992,  where  he  is  cur  rently  chairman  of  the  powerful   House  Committee.  He  is  fluent  in  Hebrew  and  Arabic,  and  also  speaks  English  well.   Sharon,  Palestinian  Authority  Chairman  Yasser  Arafat  and  the  embassies  of  Egypt  and  Jordan  called  Tarif  to  congratulate  him.  When  Arafat  called  Tarif,  he  invited  him  to  visit  in  Gaza.   Tarifs  achievement  was  heavily  covered  in  the  Arab  media.  In  an  inter  view  with  the  Qatari  TV  station  Al  Jazeera,  Tarif  described  the  Palestini  ans  as  “brothers”  and  said  “we  must  bring  overall  peace  to  our  Palestinian  brethren,  and  their  rights  to  establish  a  Palestinian  state  with  its  capital  in  East  Jerusalem”.  He  promised  to  resign  from  the  Sharon  government  if  it  did  not  achieve  these  aims,  and  said  he  had  decided  to  join  the  govern  ment  to  “block  the  radical  right  and  prevent  war  and  tragedy,  which  these  radicals  in  the  cabinet  may  consider”.   Arab  MKs,  however,  attacked  Tarif  for  joining  the  government.  MK  Azmi  Bishara  (National  Democratic  Alliance)  said  Tarif  was  “nothing  but  a  fig  leaf  designed  to  cover  up  this  gov  ernment’s  policy  under  the  honorary  title  of  Minister  Without  Portfolio”.   Tarif  said  Sharon  told  him  he  would  have  plenty  to  do  and  suggest  ed  he  could  be  used  on  the  diplomat  ic  front.  Tarif  has  good  relations  with  Arafat  and  met  with  late  Syrian  leader  Hafez  Assad.   “We  are  truly  entering  a  new  era,”  Tarif  told  Israel  Radio.  “This  is  a  cer  tificate  of  honour  for  Israeli  society  which  has  begun  to  see  us  [Druse]  as  true  partners  and  not  people  who  fill  posts  based  on  a  quota  system.”   Jerusalem  Post ",2001-03-09

"  Jewish  identity   falling  in  US   NEW  YORK  —  A  study  has  found  decreased  identification  with  Judaism  and  rising  intermarriage   rates  in  the  US.   Most  view  it  as  a  signal  to  step  up  efforts  to  strengthen  Jewish  continuity  —  through  dayschool  education  and  making  synag  ogues  more  meaningful  for  some,  while  for  others,  it  means  non  religious  expression,  such  as  social  action  and  the  arts.   The  American  Jewish  Identity  Survey  estimates  that  5.5  million  Americans  are  Jewish  —  of  whom  1.4  million  identify  as  members  of  another  religion.   Even  among  those  who  identify  Judaism  as  their  religion,  42  per  cent  profess  a  secular  outlook  and  14  per  cent  do  not  believe  in  God.  By  contrast,  only  15  per  cent  of  Americans  describe  their  outlook  as  secular.   While  only  half  of  American  Jews  are  affiliated  to  a  synagogue  or  Jewish  organisation,  most  identify  with  a  stream  of  Judaism  —  30  per  cent  with  Reform,  24  per  cent  Conservative,  8  per  cent  Orthodox,  1  per  cent  Recon  structionist  and  1  per  cent  Secular  Humanism.   Six  per  cent  used  self  generated  labels  like  “liberal”  or  “atheist”,  and  20  per  cent  declined  to  identify  with  any  label  or  branch  of  Judaism.   The  findings  are  contradicted  by  measures  suggesting  that  interest  in  Judaism  is  up:  day  school  enrolment  is  up,  scores  of  new  schools  have  been  founded,  sales  of  books  on  Judaism  are  up,  adult  Jewish  education  courses  are  proliferating,  and  the  Reform  movement  is  increasingly  embracing  traditional  ritual  and   observance.

"  Secret  Recipes  of  Jewish  cuisine   Victor  ECleerekopor   COOKING  a  Shabbat  or  yom  tov  meal  can  be  as  much  part  of  the  festive  experience  as  sitting  down  to  eat  it,  says  cookbook  writer  Rene  Nathan.   Ms  Nathan  will  demonstrate  the   art  of  cooking  Jewish  food  in  episode  11  of  chef  Jacques  Reymond’s  ABC  TV  show  Secret  Recipes,  which  screens  on  Wednesdays  at  8pm.   Indeed,  despite  a  full  work  sched  ule,  it  is  nothing  for  Ms  Nathan  and  her  husband  Joel  to  have  14  people  at  their  Friday  night  Shabbat  meal.   Ms  Nathan,  born  in  South  Africa,  learned  to  cook  as  a  child  from  her  mother  and  grandmother.   “At  16  I  decided  to  write  the  recipes  in  a  black  book  that  1  still  have  with  me,”  she  said.   Ms  Nathan,  who  moved  to  Aus  tralia  in  1983,  has  written  a  number  of  cookbooks,  but  not  one  using  her  Jewish  recipes.  She  sees  food  as  a  metaphor  for  love  and  nurturing.   “Cooking  is  an  act  of  love,  and  what’s  more,  the  family  has  to  sit   around  the  table  and  communicate.   “This  is  exemplified  by  the  Friday  night  Shabbat  meal  when  the  family  gets  together.  We  are  secular  Jews  but  still  have  our  Friday  night  meal.  The  Friday  night  ritual  is  the  glue  that  brings  the  family  together.”   On  TV  she  prepares  a  baked  gefilte  fish,  Danish  herring  and  her  father’s  borsht  (beetroot  soup).

"  answer   ON  August  7  the  Australian  Bureau  of  Statistics  (ABS)  will  conduct  the  five  yearly  Census  of  the  Australian  popu   lation.   While  the  overall  Census  differs  lit  tle  from  1996,  there  is  a  new  question  about  the  internet  and  a  return  of  the  1986  question  about  ancestry.  The  question  asks  what  is  the  person’s  ancestry,  with  the  option  of  nominat  ing  more  than  one  response.  There  are  boxes  for  British,  Irish,  Italian,  German,  Greek,  Chinese  and  Australian.  Other  ancestries  need  to  be  written  onto  the  form.   The  aim  of  the  question  is  to  reach  a  better  understanding  of  the  ethnic  mix  of  the  population,  especially  in  association  with  other  indicators  of  educational,  social  and  economic  sta   tus.   There  has  been  some  discussion  in  this  newspaper  and  other  places  regarding  the  likely  response  of  the  Jewish  community  to  the  ancestry  question  in  comparison  with  the  optional  question  on  religion.  In  1986  about  27,000  persons  in  NSW  said   they  were  of  Jewish  religion,  com  pared  to  10,000  who  said  they  were  of  Jewish  ancestry.  Most  of  our  commu  nity  responded  to  ancestry  with  their  country  of  origin  (eg  Australian,  German,  Hungarian).   In  their  comment  about  the  ances   try  question  for  2001,  the  ABS  con  cedes  that  its  use  will  be  confined  mainly  to  people  bom  overseas.  The  ABS  hopes  that  a  combination  of  birthplace  and  ancestry  will  yield  valuable  information  on  ethnicity,  especially  about  new  immigrants.  For  those  interested,  the  relevant  website  is  www.abs.gov.au/ausstats  and  look  up  catalogue  number  2008.0.   It  is  probable  that  the  similar  word  ing  of  the  ancestry  question  will  yield  similar  responses  in  the  Jewish  com  munity  with  perhaps  no  more  than  one-third  responding  Jewish.  This  does  not  mean  that  the  question  is  of  no  value,  since  some  respondents  will  give  their  ancestry  as  Jewish  while  not  declaring  Judaism  as  their  reli  gion.  This  may  be  because  the  reli  gion  question  is  optional,  while  the   ancestry  question  is  (theoretically)  compulsory,  or  simply  because  they  regard  themselves  as  ethnic  Jews  while  not  religiously  observant.  It  will  be  interesting  to  link  this  response  with  intermarriage  rates.   Much  of  our  planning  for  schools,  aged  care  and  social  relief  is  based  on  Census  data.  Additionally,  representar  tion  to  government  is  assisted  by  good  Census  statistics.  When  we  analyse  the  2001  Census,  we  will  use  both  religion  and  ancestry  to  esti  mate  the  size  of  the  community,  but  religion  is  almost  certain  to  be  the  key   indicator.   Census  returns  are  forbidden  by  law  to  be  made  available  outside  the  ABS,  and  names  are  not  entered  onto  the  master  data  set  Members  of  the  community  should  feel  confident  that  responding  “Jewish”  to  religion  or  ancestry  or  both  will  benefit  the  com  munity  and  have  no  possibility  of  repercussion  to  themselves   Gary  EdssJeln   JCA  demographer ",2001-05-18
"  Arts  JN   Scottish  busker  with  a  Jewish  flavour   Anita  Jawary   A  YOUNG  man  with  a  mop  of  black  hair   and  wearing  a  shirt  of  the  Aboriginal  flag  stood  up,  pulled  out  a  harmonica  and  began  to  play.  The  notes  slid,  gyrated  and  wailed  to  a  rhythm  tapped  out  on  a  baseboard.  His  lean  torso  stretched  and  bent  to  the  highs  and  lows  of  the  harmonica’s  call.   When  Scottish  busker  Rory  Mdeod  finished  his  opening  number,  the  audience  at  the  Apol-  lo  Bay  music  festival  Big  Top  was  already  up  and  dancing.   Then  he  picked  up  a  guitar  and  sang  a  song  for  his  mother  —  a  nurse,  doctor,  friend  and  chef,  the  woman  who  served  everyone  first  and  herself  last.  Then  he  sang  a  song  for  his  grandmother  —  a  seamstress  who  loved  to  go  “g’dancin”.   Who  else  but  a  good  Jewish  boy  would  sing  a  song  for  his  mother  and  grandmother?  And  the  Aboriginal  flag?  Who  else  but  a  good  Jew-  ish  boy  would  stand  up  for  the  rights  of  the  dis-  possessed?   After  the  concert  I  drew  him  aside,  and  he   glowed  with  pride.  “Yes!  I’m  Jewish!  I  wasn’t  brought  up  Jewish,  but  I  feel  a  kinship  for  Jew-  ish  people;  I  can  tell  immediately  if  someone  is  Jewish.”   I  momentarily  wondered  if  the  Mcleod  clan  was  the  lost  tribe  disguised  in  kilts.   Mcleod’s  great-grandparents  escaped  from  Zhitomir,  Russia,  to  London’s  East  End  during  the  time  of  the  Czar.  His  grandmother  was  nine  months  old  at  the  time.  They  spoke  only  Yid-  dish,  so  his  grandmother  translated  for  them.   Born  Goldstein,  she  married  a  Cohen  from  Lithuania.  To  help  avoid  East  End  anti-  semitism,  Mcleod’s  grandparents  changed  their  name  to  Conway.  Mcleod  had  so  little  Jewish  background  that  when  he  heard  his  grandparents  speaking  Yiddish,  he  thought  it   was  French.   How  did  Conway  become  Mcleod?  Against  the  wishes  of  her  parents,  Macleod’s  mother  ran  away  with  a  Scotsman  to  Glasgow.  She  never  kept  up  her  Judaism,  but  it  showed  in  the  food;  her  favourite  dish  as  a  child  was  egg  and  matzah.   Mcleod  has  been  in  Australia  since  January,   performing  in  NSW,  Queensland,  Northern  Territory,  Western  Australia,  South  Australia  and  Tasmania  at  festivals,  events  and  venues.  He  returns  to  Britain  at  the  end  of  this  month  to  prepare  for  a  tour  of  Britain  and  Europe.   People  say  that  no  matter  how  far  you  wan-  der,  if  you’ve  got  Jewish  blood,  it  calls  you,  and  at  some  time  in  your  life,  you  answer.  Despite  the  fact  that  Mcleod  does  not  connect  with  Judaism  in  any  formal  sense,  he  has  kept  the  tradition  of  naming  a  child  after  a  family  mem-  ber;  his  son  is  Solly,  after  his  grandfather,  and  his  middle  name  is  Kish,  meaning  “gift”.   “We’ve  had  two  miscarriages,  so  Solly  is  a  gift,”  he  adds.  There  is  religious  sensibility  in   that  act.   When  I  invited  Mcleod  to  a  seder,  his  eyes  danced  with  delight.  “I’ve  never  been  to  a  seder.”  I  imagined  how  lovely  it  would  be  to  hear  him  sing  Ma  Nishtana  for  the  first  time,  but  his  schedule  did  not  permit  it.  We  were  both  disappointed.   But  who  knows?  Maybe  next  year.   ■  Rory  Mcleod  will  perform  at  The  Basement  on  Sunday,  April  8.   Scottish  busker  Rory  Mcleod. ",2001-04-06
"  True  film  about  Jewish   neo-Nazi  wins  top  award   LOS  ANflFJ.ES:  A  film  about  a  Jew  who  becomes  the  leader  of  an  antisemitic  gang  has  won  the  highest  honour  for  drama  at  the  Sundance  Film   Festival.   The  Believer  focuses  on  a  rebellious  Hebrew  school  student  and  barmitzvah  boy  who  later  heads  the  neo-Nazi  gang.   Incredible  as  it  may  sound,  the  movie,  origi  nally  titled  The  Jewish  Nazi,  is  based  on  a  true  story.   In  the  1960s,  a  New  York  Times  reporter  inter  viewed  neo-Nazi  Daniel  Burros,  who  had  been  arrested  at  a  Ku  Klux  Klan  redly,  on  a  tip  that  the  racist  tough  guy  was  actually  Jewish.  When  the  reporter  revealed  Burros’  ethnic  identity,  Burros  put  a  gun  to  his  head  and  killed  himself.   Writer-director  Henry  Bean  was  fascinated  by  Burros’  dualism  and  created  the  character  of  Danny  Balint.  The  adolescent  Danny  is  a  spirited  Hebrew  school  student  who  challenges  his  teacher’s  lessons  on  the  Bible  and  is  eventually  expelled.  He  rejects  his  childhood  background  until  he  becomes  the  charismatic  and  fearless  leader  of  a  band  of  skinhead  thugs.   But  Danny  is  not  your  usual  self-hater.  Even  while  trashing  a  synagogue,  he  finds  himself  pro  tecting  the  Torah  from  his  brutish  gang  mem  bers.  He  even  continues  to  study  the  Bible  and   Hebrew,  telling  his  girlfriend  that  he  does  so  to  understand  “the  enemy”.   At  the  same  time,  as  the  gang’s  articulate  leader,  he  surpasses  even  his  followers’  anti  semitism,  criticising  three  famous  Jews  —  Karl  Marx,  Sigmund  Freud  and  Albert  Einstein  —  as  having  imposed  “Communism,  infantile  sexuality  and  the  atom  bomb”  on  mankind.   Director  Bean  traced  his  own  evolution  from  his  early  years  in  a  “very,  very  Reform”  Philadel  phia  home  to  a  “rinky-dink”  barmitzvah,  and  finally  to  rejection  of  the  synagogue.  Due  mainly  to  the  influence  of  his  wife,  a  screenwriter  and  daughter  of  a  rabbi,  Bean  now  attends  a  Conser  vative  synagogue  and  keeps  a  kosher  home.   In  the  screen  character  of  Danny  Balint,  Bean  found  echoes  of  his  own  adolescent  conflicts,  pushed  to  the  extreme.  “The  idea  that  you  could  try,  however  catastrophically,  to  be  two  things  at  once  —  a  living  contradiction,  a  thing  and  its  opposite  —  was  a  magical  moment  in  my  life.”   Trying  to  assemble  a  cast  and  crew  for  The  Believer,  Bean  found  that  its  theme  was  too  offen  sive  for  some.  His  first  choice  for  the  title  role  refused,  and  some  members  of  the  crew  pulled  out.  Bean  also  changed  the  film’s  title,  acknowl  edging  that  it  could  be  difficult  to  rent  locations   to  shoot  a  movie  called  The  Jewish  Nazi   J1A ",2001-03-02
"  Jewish-born  cardinal  defends  his  Church   Victor  Kleerekoper   A  CATHOLIC  cardinal  who  was  bom  Jewish  has  defended  the  decision  of  the  Catholic  Church  not  to  let  Holocaust  scholars  into  the  Vatican’s  archives.   Cardinal  Jean-Marie  Lustiger  told  an  overflowing  audience  in  Melbourne  this  week  that  the  scholars,  both  Catholic  and  Jewish,  had  been  stopped  for  technical   reasons.   But  he  promised  that  the  archives  would  be  reopened  when  classification  of  the  material  was  complete.   ‘The  Catholic  responsible  for  the  archive  was  very  angry  when  the  criticism  went  out  about  the  situation,”  he  said.  “It  was  not  a  problem  about  the  Jews,  but  a  technical  problem.  There  are  from  this  period  thousands  of  documents  that  have  not  yet  been  classified,  and  we  can’t  make  them  open  until  they  are  classified.  This  requires  time  but  the  principle  has  not  changed.  The  archives  are  open  and  in  time  they  will  be  (completely)  opened.”   Cardinal  Lustiger,  who  became  a  Catholic  after  he  was  fostered  by  a  French  Catholic  family  during  World  War  II,  was  interviewed  in  Melbourne  by  former  Australian  Jewish  News  editor  Sam  Lipski.   The  Cardinal  defended  Pope  Pius  XII,  who  has  been  criticised  for  his  failure  to  speak  out  on  Holocaust  issues  at  the  time.  He  said  his  own   memories  of  World  War  II,  when  he  was  between  13  and  19  years  old  in  France,  were  of  doublespeak  and  vagueness.  “Even  in  writing  letters  or  speaking  against  the  Germans  or  persecution,  we  never  spoke  as  openly  as  we  do  today.  The  key  of  what  the  Pope  did  has  to  be  studied  by  history  and  not  judged  by  today,”  he  said.   Mr  Lipsld  asked  the  cardinal  what  he  thought  of  Vatican  II  and  the  document  Nostra  Aetate,  which  cleared  the  Jews  of  the  long-held  charge  of  killing  Jesus.   “Jews  symbolise  the   conscience  of  humankind...   Jews  are  guilty  to  be  the  conscience  of  the  future.”   Cardinal  Lustiger  said  the  document  was  a  necessary  step  for  the  Church.  “It  was  late,  but  it  came.  The  history  of  the  text  is  interesting,  and  there  was  opposition  to  it  from  the  Western  Christians  and  the  Christians  in  the  Arab  countries.  Some  of  the  bishops  thought  there  would  be  tensions  and  oppositions  within  the  Church  or  disruptions.   “People  were  angry  because  they  did  not  agree  that  there  is  a  special  place  for  Judaism  and  its  rich  history.  But  others  knew  that  the  revelation  of  the  laws  of  Heaven  and  earth  was  made  to  the  Jews.   “There  was  such  a  change  for   many  people  that  at  the  beginning  there  was  only  the  question  of  a  textual  situation,  and  so  Judaism  was  only  one  thing  among  everything.”   Cardinal  Lustiger  said  that  Judaism  has  been  recognised  as  the  basis  for  other  religions,  both  theologically  and  de  facto.   Asked  if  the  message  of  Vatican  II  had  been  accepted,  he  said  that  since  Vatican  II,  the  central  core  of  the  problems  had  been  identified.  “There  are  educated  people  who  understand  that  the  Jews  have  been  the  source  of  human  rights  laws,  but  there  were  others  who  used  this  as  the  source  of  their  aggressiveness.   “The  Bible,  the  Torah,  is  spread  among  the  nations,  even  in  China  where  nobody  knows  what  a  Jew  is.  I  think  the  Bible  is  a  unique  book  in  the  history  of  humankind  and  the  Bible  speaks  about  the  Jews,  about  what  God  gave  them,  about  the  promise  and  so  on.   “Jews  symbolise  the  conscience  of  humankind,  and  Jews  are  guilty,  not  because  they  are  better  than  other  people,  but  because  they  are  the  sign  of  this.  Jews  are  guilty  to  be   the  conscience  of  the  future.”   Cardinal  Lustiger  said  human  rights  issues  would  become  even  more  important  in  the  future.  “The  vocation  of  the  Christians  and  the  Jewish  people  is  to  fight  for  the  respect  of  the  human  being.  It  is  a  question  of  death  or  life  for  the  whole  humanity,”  he  said.   Jewlsh-bom  Catholic  Cardinal  Jean-Marie  Lustlger   Photo:  Justin  Bemhaut ",2001-08-10
"  Unsung  hero  who  rescued  Jewish  icons   Varlan  Fry  sought  to  rescue  such  illuminaries  as  Marc   Chagai!  and  Hannah  Arendt  from  Nazi-occupied  Europe.  His  story  has  now  been   brought  to  the  screen.  Tom  Tugend  reports.   DURING  the  Holocaust,  there  were   thousands  of  unknown  rescuers,  some  of  whom  paid  with  broken  careers,  social  ostracism  or  even  their  lives.   Among  them,  Raoul  Wallenberg  and  Oskar  Schindler  may  be  the  best-known  names,  but  their  ranks  include  63  diplomats  from  24   countries.   A  fresh  entry  in  this  genre  is  Varian's  War—  a  two-hour  docudrama  that  screened  on  Showtime  Networks  in  the  United  States  last  week.   The  title  character  is  Varian  Fry,  a  non-Jew  classicist  and  scholarly  editor,  who  in  1940,  when  most  Americans  still  ignored  the  Nazi  threat  and  opposed  the  admission  of  Jewish  refugees,  decided  to  launch  his  own  rescue  operation.   As  an  envoy  of  the  New  York-based  Emergency  Rescue  Committee,  he  made  his  way  to  Marseilles,  in  unoccupied  Vichy  France,  where  thousands  of  refugees  were  clamouring  to  escape  Hitler’s  juggernaut.   Fry  had  a  specific  mission:  to  rescue  the  great  artists  and  intellectuals,  “the  soul  of  Europe”,  and  get  them  to  the  United  States.  On  his  list  were  painters  Marc  Chagall  and  Max  Ernst,  writers  Franz  Werfel,  Lion  Feuchtwanger,  Heinrich  Mann  and  Hannah  Arendt,  and  scientist  Otto  Meyerhof.   To  achieve  his  goal,  the  scholarly  32-year  old  Fry,  played  by  William  Hurt,  found  himself  knee-deep  on  forged  documents,  illegal  financial  transactions,  and  games  of  bluff  with  Vichy  and  German  officials.   He  was  elided  by  Miriam  Davenport  (Julia  Ormond),  a  sexually  liberated  American  woman,  US  Vice-Consul  Harry  Bingham  (Ted   Whittali),  a  shrewd  refugee  (Matt  Craven),  a   William  Hurt  as  Vafian  Fly  in  Vartan's  War.   skilled  forger  (Alan  Arkin)  and  a  feisty  Alma  Werfel-Mahler  (Lynn  Redgrave).   Fry’s  job  was  not  made  easier,  at  least  in  this  version,  by  Chagall,  who  insisted  that  as  a  French  citizen  and  famous  artist,  he  would  be   immune  to  Nazi  persecution.   In  a  climactic  scene,  Fry  leads  his  famous  charges  across  the  Pyrenees  Mountains  to  safety  in  Spain.   The  writer-director  of  Varian’s  War  is  Lionel   Wrtter/director  Lionel  Chetwynd  on  the  set  of   Varian's  War.   Chetwynd,  whose  TV  credits  include  Sadat  and  The  Man  Who  Captured  Eichmann  and  the  screenplay  adaptation  of  the  movie  The  Apprenticeship  of  Duddy  Kravitz,  taken  from  the  novel  by  Mordecai  Richler.  He  has  drawn  generally  satisfying  performances  from  an  able  cast,  including  Hurt,  who  starts  out  as  a  rather  pale  figure  but  gains  in  strength  and  authority  as  the  film  progresses.   Documentary  film-maker  Pierre  Sauvage  (Weapons  of  the  Spirit),  who  is  preparing  his  own  documentary  on  Fry,  has  posted  a  critique  of  Varian’s  War  on  his  website,  charging  minor  and  substantial  errors  in  chronology  and  character  depiction.  Chetwynd  acknowledges  that  some  of  the  characters  represent  composites  and  that  he  has  striven  for  “a  dramatised  presentation  of  reality”.  But  what  matters  to  Chetwynd,  he  says,  is  that  “here  was  a  man  who  put  his  body  between  the  culture  of  Europe  and  the  darkness  of  Europe.  In  that  sense,  Fry  saved  a  little  bit  of  all  of  us.  Anyone  who,  for  instance,  has  seen  the  Chagall  windows  in  Jerusalem  will  agree  to  that.”   During  a  news  conference,  Chetwynd  was  asked  if  the  networks  and  movie  studios  weren’t  producing  an  overdose  of  Holocaust  related  productions.  “No,”  responded  Chetwynd,  “when  you  rotate  the  prism  of  that  era,  time  and  time  again,  each  moment  comes  up  with  a  different  picture.”   JTA ",2001-04-27
"  A  rich  Jewish   life  Down  Under   E  eat  steaming  latkes  and  hot  doughnuts  in  32-degree  sum  mers.  We  shiver  in  the  succah  and  say  a  prayer  for  rain  ▼  ¥  while  it  is  teeming  outside.  As  Australian  Jews,  we  are  an  upside-down  people.   Of  course,  we  aren’t  the  only  ones.  After  a  month  of  seeing  over  dressed  Father  Christmases,  cotton-wool  snowballs  and  advertise  ments  for  mid-winter  roast  turkey,  it  is  clear  that  Australian  Christians,  likewise,  have  to  adjust  to  the  dissonant  demands  of  Southern  Hemisphere  weather.   But  as  we  enjoy  the  gentler  rhythm  of  the  holiday  season  and  relax  in  the  summer  sun,  it  is  an  appropriate  time  to  consider  the  way  we  attune  our  lives,  Jewishly  and  otherwise,  to  the  rhythms  of  the  seasons.  Often,  as  Jews,  we  are  more  in  touch  with  the  vagaries  of  history  than  of  geography.  It  does  not  always  make  us  particu  larly  environmentally  sensitive,  and  it  certainly  produces  some  anomalies  —  unreasonably  long  fast  days,  seasonally  inappropri  ate  celebrations  and  a  highlighting  of  some  festivals  along  with  a  tendency  to  virtually  ignore  others.   At  the  end  of  this  month,  for  example,  it  will  be  Tu  b’Shvat,  the  New  Year  for  the  Trees.  In  many  communities,  this  ancient  arbour  day  has  been  revitalised  by  the  environmentally  aware  movement.  It  is  an  ideal  festival  to  appeal  to  greenies,  who  often  yearn  for  a  way  to  combine  their  political  and  social  consciences  with  Jewish  tradition.  Traditionally,  Tu  b’Shvat  is  the  day  when  children  and  adults  plant  young  saplings  and  give  thanks  for  the  green  in  nature.  Trouble  is,  there  just  isn’t  much  green  to  be  seen  in  late  January  in  Australia.  Try  planting  anything  in  the  baking  heat  of  summer,  and  the  results  tend  to  provide  little  reason  to  give  thanks.   Besides  which,  late  January  is  still  holiday  time  for  many  schools,  and  therefore  for  many  Australian  families.  Still  holidaying  at  the  coast  or  otherwise  distracted,  they  tend  to  miss  activities  which  the  community  plans  for  Tu  b’Shvat.  By  default,  therefore,  it  has  become  a  chag  of  which  most  members  of  the  community  are  barely  aware.   Conversely,  Chanukah,  also  a  minor  festival  by  objective  stan  dards,  has  been  inflated  out  of  ail  proportion  to  its  historical  importance.  In  large  measure,  this  has  happened  in  many  coun  tries,  particularly  the  United  States,  as  a  kind  of  quid  pro  quo  for  the  ubiquitous  Christmas  celebrations.   In  Australia,  however,  where  the  festival  falls  close  to  the  end  of  the  school  year,  Chanukah  has  taken  off  as  a  major  event.  Public  celebrations  are  held  throughout  the  city,  from  cruises  on  the  har  bour  to  menorah-Iighting  in  Martin  Place  to  massive  gatherings  in  St  Ives.  The  level  of  observance  usurps  many  more  technically  important  festivals  because  it  fits  the  rhythm  of  our  year.   Lag  b’Omer  tends  to  get  largely  ignored  —  who  wants  to  sit  around  a  bonfire  when  it  is  freezing  outside?  —  while  Purim  lends  itself  to  energetic  participation  by  children  and  young  families.   These  aren’t  necessarily  religious  decisions,  but  they  do  create  a  Judaism  with  a  flavour  that  is  influenced  by  our  seasons.  It  is  a  strange  tension  for  it  pulls  between  the  Israel-focused,  Northern  Hemisphere  Jewish  rhythm  and  the  pattern  dictated  by  our   Australian  lives.   But  there  is  much  to  be  said  for  acknowledging  and  enjoying  its  ironies.  So  much  of  what  we  regard  as  Jewish  is  in  fact  a  result  of  influences  from  beyond:  gefilte  fish  for  the  Ashkenazi  and  yaprakis  for  the  Sephardi,  streimels  and  kapote  from  the  dress  of  the  Polish  aristocrat,  pastrami  and  rye  from  the  archetypal  New  York  deli.  Perhaps  the  day  will  come  when  there  will  be  a  classic  Australian  Chanukah  recipe  (served  cold).  It  could  only  add  to  the  richness  of   our  Jewish  life. ",2001-01-05
"  SanasiSta  B@sSs«   JEWISH  musician  Rick  Grossman  may  have  played  in  one  of  Australia's  most  successful  rock’n’roll  bands,  but  he  is  the  antithesis  of  the  ageing  rocker.   Dressed  in  a  black  shirt  and  red  jeans,  Grossman  looks  younger  than  his  45  years,  ten  of  which  were  spent  as  the  bass-player  in  the  acclaimed  Australian  band,  Hoodoo  Gurus.  Together  the  group  toured  the  United  States,  Brazil,  Europe  and  Japan,  play  ing  to  crowds  of  up  to  10,(KM).  They  released  15  albums  before  disbanding  in  1998,  and  when  pushed  to  hazard  a  guess,  Grossman  thinks  the  group  has   sold  around  1  million  albums  world  wide.   “We  didn’t  want  to  end  up  like  a  trib  ute  band,  so  we  stopped  when  we  were  on  a  high,”  Grossman  says  between  sips  of  a  long-black  in  Darlinghurst’s  Tropicana  Cafe.  “I’ve  spent  years  touring  and  I  don’t  want  to  do  that  any  more.  But  I’ve  loved  music  forever  and  I’m  now  attempting  to  lure  young  new  artists  to  record  with  me  in  my  Kings  Cross  studio.”   Between  recording  other  musicians  and  dabbling  in  film  composition,  Grossman  spends  time  playing  music  with  long  time  collaborator  Mick  Moffitt  in  their  band  Fire  Hand  Ember.  The  group  —  which  also  features  Joseph  Calderazzo—plan  to  release  a  new  album  next  year.  There’s  also  a  retrospective  album  in  the  pipeline  for  Matt  Finish,  a  band  in  which  Grossman  and  Moffitt  played  from  1979-1981.  Grossman  is  also  part  of  Ghostwriters,  a  group  that  includes  Midnight  Oil  drummer  Rob  Hirst.   Turning  his  mind  back  to  those  years  on  the  road  with  Hoodoo  Gurus,  Grossman  addresses  the  reputation  for  excess  that  has  long  surrounded  Australian  bands.  “In  the  ‘70s  when  bands  like  AC/DC,  Sherbet  and  Skyhooks  were  playing,  that  outra  geous  lifestyle  that  many  people  talk  about,  was  true,”  Grossman  muses.  “But  I’ve  never  had  that  land  of  lifestyle.  My  experience  was  of  long  days  of  travel  and  spending  large  amounts  of  time  on  my  own.  But  it’s  an  addictive  lifestyle.  There’s  the  promise  of  something  around  the  comer  that   never  comes.”   Yet  the  professional  musician  and  father  of  two,  confirms  he’s  happier  now  living  full-time  in  Sydney  with  his  family,  where  he  divides  his  time  between  a  handful  of  musical  projects,  his  recording  studio  and  his  growing  passion  for  film  composition.   Grossman  has  played  with  some  of  the  best-known  and  influential  people  in  Australian  music.  He  made  his  name  in  the  short-Jived,  but  seminal,  punk   band  Bleeding  Hearts  in  the  late  70s,  going  on  to  play  with  rock  group  Divinyls  and  acclaimed  Australian  singer  songwriter  Paul  Kelly  before  taking  up  with  Hoodoo  Gurus  in  1988.   When  he  moved  to  Melbourne  from   Sydney  in  his  early  20s,  Grossman  lived  in  a  house  with  Kelly,  who  had  yet  to  make  a  mark  on  the  Australian  music  scene.  “He’d  just  come  over  horn  Adelaide  and  had  this  brown  suit  case  with  all  his  lyrics  in  it,”  Grossman  recalls  fondly.  “We  put  together  a  band  and  did  his  first  gig  away  from  Adelaide  at  a  beginners’  night  in  a  pub.”  That  night,  Kelly’s  backing  band  also  including  Skyhooks  guitarist  and  now  television  personality  Red  Symons  and  composer  Martin  Armiger.   “I  have  memories  of  that  which  are  great.  Living  with  Paul  was  great,  and  Fd  love  to  do  some  more  playing  with  him  but  it’s  hard  because  he  lives  in  Melbourne  and  I  don’t  see  him  that  often.  We’ve  all  got  lads  now  and  we’ve  all  changed  a  bit”   Bom  to  a  Jewish  father  and  Anglican  mother,  who  both  came  to  Australia  from  England  in  the  1950s,  Grossman  says  he  has  a  strong  Jewish  identity,  although  he  is  non-practising.   “I’m  a  lapsed  Jew,”  Grossman  states  after  a  long  pause.  “I  didn’t  have  a  bar  mitzvah  and  my  sister  and  1  weren’t  brought  up  in  a  religious  atmosphere   at  all.”   Grossman’s  father,  who  came  from  Russian  parentage,  was  ostracised  by  his  family  for  marrying  a  Gentile,  and  the  family’s  ambivalent  attitude  towards  religion  was  a  result  of  that,  Grossman  says.   “On  the  other  hand,  my  father  used  to  take  me  to  synagogue  and  we  grew  up  in  a  Jewish  atmosphere  at  home.  All  my  mum’s  friends  were  Jewish  and  she  worked  for  Wizo  for  years.  I  grew  up  loving  the  Jewish  community,  its  family  orientation  and  sense  of   humour.”   Grossman’s  eyes  shine  as  his  thoughts  turn  to  Valerie  Newstead  —  whom  he  refers  to  as  “auntie”  —  a  long  time  family  friend  who  came  to  Australia  on  the  same  ship  as  his  par  ents.  “The  Newstead’s  were  like  my  other  family  when  I  was  growing  up.  To  me,  Valerie  is  a  great  Jewish  woman,  with  a  great  family  who  love  to  be  around  her,  which  is  what  I’d  aspire  to  as  a  parent.”   Grossman  attended  Scots  College  and  Sydney  Boys  High,  although  his  experiences  at  the  former  were  not  positive.   “I  went  to  a  school  that  was  Victorian  in  its  attitudes,  where  any  one  who  was  different  had  it  belted  out  of  them.  There  was  a  lot  of  corpo   Rick  Grossman  Photo:  Amelia  Whitaker   rai  purusnment,  a  lot  oi  antisemitism.  This  was  in  contrast  to  my  experience  of  being  Jewish  away  horn  school,  which  was  about  family  and  warmth.”   Grossman  started  playing  profes  sionally  at  21  in  Bleeding  Hearts  with  Eric  Grad  man,  who  is  Jewish.  “I  under  stood  his  cynicism  and  humour,  better  than  anyone  else,”  Grossman  recalls.  “But  we  never  discussed  our  religion,  I  don’t  remember  sitting  and  talking  about  it  with  him.”   Thinking  back  over  his  career,  Grossman  admits  he  hasn’t  met  many   Jews  who  play  in  rock  bands.  “There  was  Zev  Isaac,  who  lives  in  Israel  now,  but  in  the  early  ‘80s  managed  Midnight  Oil.”  But  the  closest  he  came  to  jazz/blues  singer  Rene  Geyer  was  sharing  a  dressing  room  before  a  per   formance.   But  Grossman  discounts  any  inter  play  between  his  Jewish  identity  and  career.  “I  don’t  think  it’s  relevant  at  all.  The  only  way  it  could  be  is  by  the  fact  that  I  grew  up  around  Jewish  people  and  they’ve  given  me  a  sense  of  humour  about  things.”   Grossman  nominates  a  concert  by  celebrated  British  rock  group  Led  Zeppelin,  which  he  saw  at  the  Sydney  Showground  when  he  was  15,  as  the  turning  point  in  his  life.  “I  walked  in  and  walked  out  a  different  person,”  he  says  firmly.  “I  don’t  know  why  it  affect  ed  me  so  much.  It’s  a  difficult  thing  to  talk  about.”   As  a  child,  Grossman’s  mother  made  him  learn  the  cello  and  violin,  but  in  his  teenage  years,  he  swapped  them  for  the  bass  guitar.   “When  I  got  to  the  age  of  14,  my  mother  gave  up  and  I  became  extremely  interested  in  the  Beatles.  I  was  obsessed  with  music  and  by  the  time  I  was  151  knew  what  I  wanted  to  do  with  my  life.   “like  every  parent,  mine  looked  at  all  the  negatives  about  being  a  musi  cian,  but  in  the  end  they  supported  me.”   Last  year  Grossman  used  25  years   worth  of  music-world  contacts  to  co   produce  an  Olympic  compilation  fea   turing  Australian  artists.   “I’ve  been  so  lucky  to  make  some  great  friends  and  play  with  some  amazing  people  in  my  life.  I  feel  like  I  could  ring  up  any  of  them  if  I  had  something  going.”   And  that’s  just  what  Grossman  did  with  the  Olympic  compilation,  which  featured  names  like  Wendy  Matthews,  Joe  Camilleri  and  Vika  and  Linda  among  the  play  list.   Grossman  even  enticed  Jimmy  Barnes  to  get  involved,  although  his  song  was  eventually  re-recorded  by   Matthews.   “I  asked  ‘Bamsey’  to  sing  on  the  song  I  had  written  and  he  said  ‘Okay,  come  round’,”  Grossman  laughs  as  he  imitates  Barnes’  signature  gruff   Scottish  accent.  “He  said:  ‘I’ve  known  you  for  a  long  time  and  I  don’t  want  to  offend  you,  but  if  I  don’t  like  the  song,  I  won’t  sing  it.’  I  thought  fair  enough,  but  he  loved  it.”   Grossman  is  philosophical  about  the  realities  of  the  Australian  music  industry,  but  passionate  about  its  cre  ativity.   “I’ve  been  lucky,  I’ve  had  a  good  run.  But  right  now  I’m  finding  it  hard  because  I’m  trying  to  start  a  new  career  [in  film  composition],  and  this  time  I’ve  got  a  family.  But  if  you’re  pas  sionate  about  something  it’s  always  a  bit  more  painful.  I  have  a  good  friend  who  I  speak  to  about  this  a  lot  and  he’s  another  Jewish  boy  by  the  name  of  Ben  Mendelsohn.  We  talk  about  this  a  lot.  He’s  driven  to  act,  the  same  way  I’m  driven  to  music.”   The  Hoodoo  Gurus  from  left:  Rick  Grossman,  Mark  Klngsmlll,  Brad  Shepherd,  Dave  Faulkner. ",2001-01-12

"  Do  the  Taliban  have  Jewish  roots?   Lev  Gorodetsky   MOSCOW  —  The  only  two  Jews  now  living  in  Afghanistan  are  heirs  to  a  2700-year-old  Jewish  presence  that  may  include  members  of  the  tribe  that  makes  up  the  ruling  Taliban.   Jews  first  came  to  the  country  which  is  now  called  Afghanistan  in  the  seventh  or  eighth  centuries  BCE  following  the  first  biblical  exile  at  the  hands  of  the  Assyrians.   The  inhospitable,  mountainous  country  —  which  has  a  harsh  climate  and  is  populated  by  fierce  indigenous  tribes  —  long  served  as  a  place  where  empires  dumped  their  dissidents  and  established  colonies.   According  to  legend,  the  Ten  Tribes  of  northern  Israel  were  dispersed  in  722  BCE.   According  to  several  researchers  —  including  Israel’s  second  president,  Yitzhak  Ben-Zvi  —  Afghanistan’s  Pashtun  tribe  believe  they  are  descended  from  the  Ten  Lost  Tribes  of  Israel,  and  that  they  were  later  forcibly  converted  to   Islam.   The  Pashtuns  are  the  main  Afghani  ethnic  group  and  the  main  support  for  the  Taliban.   Jewish  texts  also  mention  this  belief,  but  there  is  no  conclusive  evidence  for  what  happened  to  the  Ten  Lost  Tribes,  and  they  effectively  disappeared  from  history.   Yet  there  is  strong  support  for  the  Pashtun-Israelite  connection,  according  to  Jerusalem-based  researcher  Rabbi  Eliyahu  Avihail.   Dozens  of  Pashtun  names  and  customs  sound  Jewish,  from  the  Pashtun  tribe  names  of  Asheri  and  Naftali  to  the  Pashtun  custom  of  a  wedding  chuppah  to  the  circumcising  of  sons  on  the  eighth  day  after  their  birth.   Several  years  ago,  Avihail  published  a  book  on  the  issue  in  Hebrew,  The  Ten  Tribes  of  Israel,  which  was  recently  translated  into  English.   If  his  thesis  is  true,  the  Taliban  —  who  are  regarded  as  antisemitic  and  anti-Israel  —  would  be  descended  from  the  lost  Hebrew  tribes.   “It  is  very  unpleasant,  but  what  can  we  do?”  Avihail  says.   Other  researchers  are  less  sure  about  the  Pashtun-Israelite  connection.   If  his  thesis  is  true,  the   Taliban  —  who  are  seen  as  antisemitic  and  anti-Israel  —  would  be  descended  from  the   lost  Hebrew  tribes.""   Rashid  Kaplanov,  a  leading  Moscow-based  researcher  of  Jewish  history,  calls  the  Lost  Tribe  theory  a  legend,  no  matter  what  the  Pashtuns  themselves  may  believe.   The  history  of  proven  Jewish  life  in  Afghanistan  is  easier  to  document.   In  the  sixth  century  BCE,  Persian  Jews  who  came  to  this  remote  part   of  the  Persian  empire  as  exiles,  military  mercenaries,  agricultural  colonists  or  traders  enjoyed  relative  tolerance.  In  the  common  era,  that  migration  picked  up  steam.   “It  is  clear  that  over  the  centuries,  lots  of  Persian  Jews  came  to  this  territory,  fleeing  the  Islamisation  of  the  former  Persian  Empire,  which  started  with  the  Arab-Muslim  conquest”  in  the  seventh  and  eight  centuries,  says  Alexej  Kornilov,  a  Moscow-based  researcher  in  the  history  of  Persian  Jewry  with  the  Russian  Academy  of  Sciences.   This  wave  of  refugees,  according  to  Kornilov,  included  Jews  forcibly  converted  to  Islam  who  sought  a  refuge  where  they  could  return  to  Judaism  without  fear  of  persecution.   The  last  mass  immigration  was  in  1839,  when  thousands  of  Persian  Jews  fleeing  forceful  conversion  in  the  nearby  Persian  city  of  Meshed  settled  in  Afghanistan.   At  the  time,  Afghanistan’s  Jewish  community  numbered  about  40,000,  most  of  whom  traded  in  skins,  carpets  and  antiquities.   The  decline  came  in  the  1870s,  when  a  number  of  anti-Jewish  measures  triggered  a  mass  exodus  to  Central  Asia,  Persia  and  Palestine,  reducing  the  number  of  Jews  in  Afghanistan  to  5000  by  1948.  Nearly  all  made  aliyah  after  the  creation  of  the  State  of  Israel  in  1948.   According  to  published  figures,  only  100-200  Jews  remained  in  Afghanistan  by  the  mid-1990s.   One  of  the  last  Jewish  communities  in  Afghanistan  was  in  the  northern  city  of  Mazar-i-sharif,  which  is  currently  the  scene  of  fierce  battles  between  the  Pashtun-based  Taliban  and  the  Northern  Alliance,  which  is  made  up  mainly  of  ethnic  Tajiks  and  supported  by  the  United  States.  Now,  reportedly,  only  two   Jews  remain.   In  Israel,  the  number  of  Jews  of   Afghani  descent  is  about  10,000.   JTA ",2001-11-02
"  Arts   French  flavour  colours  Jewish  film  festival   Jan  Epstein   THE  Festival  of  Jewish  Cine   ma  opens  in  Sydney  next  week  with  a  diverse  collec  tion  of  films  showcasing  the  revival  of  Jewish  cinema  worldwide.   This  year’s  collection  is  as  diverse  and  interesting  as  ever,  yet  still  glaringly  absent  are  Australian  feature  films  reflecting  and  celebrat  ing  the  Jewish  experience  in  this  land  of  relative  plenty  and  tolerance.   France,  which  almost  alone  in  the  world  has  the  will  and  capacity  to  challenge  the  supremacy  of  Ameri  can  cinema,  has  long  been  in  the  vanguard  of  producing  directors  who  are  not  afraid  of  Jewish  themes  and  characters.   As  a  consequence,  this  year’s  fes  tival  includes  an  astonishing  five  fea  ture  films  from  France,  plus  two  documentaries  (including  Sobibor  by  Claude  Lanzmann)  and  three  co  productions  (two  by  Amos  Kollek  and  one  by  Israeli  expatriate  film  maker  Amos  Gitai).   Among  the  films  from  France,  the  most  rewarding  is  Les  Fantomes  de  Louba  (Louba’s  Ghosts),  written  and  directed  by  Martine  Dogowson  (whose  excellent  Mina  Tannebaum  is  now  on  video).   A  deeply  moving  but  unsettling   film  that  moves  backwards  and  for  wards  in  time  from  the  Kindertrans  port  to  the  present,  Fantomes  is  about  loss  and  displacement,  and  a  biting  commentary  on  France’s  betrayal  of  its  Jews.   Elsa  Zylberstein  (Mina  Tannen  baum,  Farinelli)  plays  Louba,  a  com  plex  young  woman  and  the  daughter  of  Holocaust  survivors,  who  is  raised  in  an  orphanage  after  the  death  of  her  mother  in  a  road  acci  dent.   Deserted  by  her  father  and  haunt  ed  by  grief,  Louba’s  life  is  linked  to  Jeanie  (Camille  Japy),  also  aban  doned  as  a  child,  with  whom  she  shares  a  foster  home  briefly.  As  an  adult,  Louba  is  desperate  for  love  and  family.   When  the  chance  comes  for   a  scene  from  Les  Fantomes  de  Louba.   LouDa  10  Decome  a  nanny  sne  grabs   it,  precipitating  a  crisis  involving  her  father,  her  young  charge,  and  Jeanie,  that  leads  to  the  film’s  unusu  al  but  satisfyingly  open-ended  con   clusion.   Lightness  of  touch  is  the  key  to  Renaud  Cohen’s  Once  We  Grow  Up,  an  interestingly  observed  slice  of  thirtysomething  Parisian  life,  with  a  quirky  and  unpredictable  storyline.   Mathieu  Demy  plays  Simon,  a  young  Sephardic  Jew  with  a  bevy  of  likeable  Jewish  and  non-Jewish  friends.  His  life  becomes  complicat  ed  when  he  meets  Claire,  the  preg  nant  wife  of  his  Ashkenazi  neighbour.  Smart  dialogue  and  fine  acting,  particularly  from  Demy  and  Louise  Benarzerat  as  Simon’s  demented  Gran,  make  this  film  a  crowd-pleaser.   More  mannered  in  style  but  nonetheless  interesting  is  Gilles  Bourdos’  Disparus  (English  title  Love  Troika).  Based  on  historical  facts,  Disparus  tells  the  story  of  Alfred  Katz  (Gregoire  Colin),  a  Jew   ish  1  rotskyist  in  Pans  in  1938  who  came  into  conflict  with  the  militant  Stalinists.   Katz  was  close  to  the  bohemian  Surrealists  and  the  lover  of  Mila  (Anouk  Grinberg),  who  was  Man  Ray’s  muse.  Disparus  succeeds  in  putting  into  perspective  the  Stalin  ists’  ruthless  intolerance  of  dissent,  while  Colin  and  Grinberg  are  a  delight  to  watch.   After  the  tragic  events  of  Septem  ber  11,  two  films  by  Israeli  film-mak  ers  have  a  heightened  topicality.   Amos  Gitai’s  Kippur  is  a  drama  tised  account  of  his  own  experience  as  a  23-year-old  soldier  during  the  1973  Yom  Kippur  War.   Represented  in  the  film  as  an  artist  named  Weinraub  (Liron  Levo)  who  awakens  after  a  night  of  love  making  to  discover  that  his  country  has  been  attacked  on  the  Day  of  Atonement  by  the  Syrians  and  Egyp  tians,  Gitai  jettisons  politics  or  con  ventional  narrative  for  a  grittily  realised  descent  into  the  horrors  of   war.   Greta  Scacchi  In  One  of  The  Hollywood   Ten.   Losing  their  way  to  the  unit  to  which  they  are  conscripted  in  the  chaos  that  follows  the  surprise  attack,  Weinraub  and  his  friend  Ruso  (Tomer  Ruso)  join  an  impro  vised  rescue  team  flying  helicopters  to  the  front  line  in  an  attempt  to  bring  medical  aid  to  the  wounded.   Two  harrowing  sequences  —  an  attempt  to  rescue  a  wounded  sol  dier  on  a  stretcher  in  collapsing  mud,  and  the  shooting  down  of  the  medical  unit’s  helicopter  —  are  awe  somely  intimate  and  real.   Renato  Berta’s  camerawork  ensures  that  the  audience  is  in  the  thick  of  the  action,  and  we  never  lose  sight  of  the  men’s  humanity.   Gitai’s  previous  festival  film  was  Kadosh,  which  was  critical  of  the  extreme  religious  right  in  Israel.   In  some  ways  Time  of  Favour,  the  first  feature  film  of  US-born  director  Joseph  Cedar  which  swept  the  Israeli  Oscars  last  year  is  just  as  con   troversial.   Set  in  a  West  Bank  settlement,  the  plot  involves  a  conspiracy  by  stu   dents  of  a  charismatic  rabbi  to  blow  up  the  Dome  of  the  Rock,  the  exem  plary  symbol  of  the  Israeli-Palestin  ian  conflict.   Filmed  against  a  magnificent  backdrop  of  sweeping  hills,  valleys  and  plains,  and  marred  only  by  an  easy  plot  resolution,  Time  of  Favour  succeeds  in  walking  the  fine-line  between  offering  a  critique  and  elic  iting  understanding  of  the  zealots’  dangerous  fervour.   Australian  film-maker  Monique  Schwarz’s  excellent  Mamadrama,  a  fascinating  documentary  that  looks  at  the  way  the  Jewish  mother  has  been  depicted  in  American  silent,  Yiddish  and  Hollywood  film,  as  well  as  in  Israeli  cinema.   Perhaps  the  most  fascinating  film  in  the  festival  is  One  of  The  Holly  wood  Ten.  Written  and  directed  by  Karl  Francis,  a  Welshman  whose  body  of  work  includes  films  and  doc  umentaries  made  for  British  televi   sion,  this  involving  film  provides  an   in-depth  coverage  of  the  issues  and  r  injustices  surrounding  the  blacklist  ing  of  left-wing  Jewish  writers  and  directors  in  Hollywood  during  the   1950s.   Jeff  Goldblum  plays  Herbert  Biberman,  a  Communist  and  one  of  the  Hollywood  Ten  who  refused  to  “name  names”  and  betray  political  fellow-travellers  during  the  hysteria  of  the  Cold  War  and  the  McCarthy   witch-hunts.   Greta  Scacchi  stars  as  Biber  man’s  wife,  actor  Gale  Sondergaard,  who  after  Biberman’s  imprisonment  was  unemployed  for  22  years,  find  ing  work  only  after  his  death.   Other  films  include  Landscape,  a  Slovakian  film  that  tells  the  history  of  that  country  from  before  World  War  II  to  the  present  through  inter  connected  stories,  and  ,  a  fiction  alised  account  of  the  German-Jewish  writer  Kurt  Tucholsky,  starring  Ulrich  Noethen  (Comedian  Har  monists).

"  Pope  invokes  name  of  'Jewish'  saint   Ruth  E  Gruber   ROME  -  In  his  latest  call  for  peace  in  the  Middle  East,  Pope  John  Paul  II  has  invoked  the  name  of  Edith  Stein  -  a  Jewish  convert  to  Catholicism  who  became  a  nun,  was  killed  during  the  Holocaust  and  was  later  made  a  saint.   Stein,  canonised  in  1998  as  Saint  Teresa  Benedetta  della  Croce,  ""died,  along  with  her  sister  Rosa  and  many  others  of  her  people,  in  the  gas  chambers  of  Auschwitz-Birkenau  on  9  August  1942,""  the  pope  told  the  faithful  gathered  at  his  summer  residence  outside  Rome.   ""We  are  seeing  the  life  and  dignity  of  human  beings  trodden  upon  in  a  violent  manner  right  in  the  Holy  Land,  to  which  Saint  Teresa   Benedetta  had  a  deep  spiritual  link,""  the  pope  added  on  Sunday.   The  pope  prayed  for  the  intercession  of  Saint  Teresa  Benedetta  so  that  ""the  political  and  military  authorities  in  the  conflicting  sides  will  not  lack  good  will,  that  they  will  bear  in  mind  before  God  and  history  the  urgency  of  silencing  their  arms,  and  that  they  reflect  on  the  future  of  their  peoples  -  a  future  that  cannot  be  of  hate,  but  of  brotherhood;  not  of  confrontation  but  of  collaboration"".   Bemoaning  the  outbreak  of  ""unheard  of  brutality"",  he  also  admitted  that  his  earlier  pleas  for  peace  have  gone  unheeded.   In  declaring  Stein  a  saint  in  1998,  John  Paul  attempted  to  use  her  figure  as  a  means  of  paying  homage  to   Holocaust  victims  and  promoting  Christian-Jewish  dialogue.   At  the  time,  he  called  Stein  both  ""an  eminent  daughter  of  Israel  and  a  faithful  daughter  of  the  church""  and  used  the  canonisation  to  appeal  for  tolerance,  dialogue  and  reconciliation.   He  said  Stein's  saint's  day  each  year  -  9  August,  the  anniversary  of  her  death  -  would  be  celebrated  as  a  Holocaust  memorial,  to  remind  the  world  ""of  that  bestial  plan  to  eliminate  a  people,  which  cost  millions  of  Jewish  brothers  and  sisters  their  lives"".   Honouring  Stein  in  this  way,  however,  affronted  some  Jewish  sensibilities.   Many  Jews  said  that  by  making  a  Jewish  convert  to  Catholicism  a  saint,  the  pope  had  offended  the  memory  of  the  Holocaust's  Jewish   victims.

"  Herb  Keinon   JEWISH  organisations  from  around  the  world  are  setting  up  operations  in  Washington  and  Geneva  to  spear  head  lobbying  efforts  to  change  the  tone  of  virulent  anti-Israel,  anti-Zion  ist  and  antisemitic  draft  resolutions   to  be  considered  at  a  major  UN  con  ference  on  racism  in  Durban,  South  Africa  at  the  end  of  August.   This  was  one  of  the  operative  decisions  that  emerged  from  an  international  “emergency”  meeting  of  Jewish  leaders  held  in  London  this  week  to  discuss  how  to  combat  these  proposals  and  plan  for  the  Durban  conference.   Deputy  Foreign  Minister  Michael  Melchior,  heading  Israel’s  efforts  to  combat  the  resolutions,  said  that  the  resolutions  constitute  “some  of  the  worst  expressions  of  delegitimisation  of  Jews  that  we  have  ever  experi  enced”.  A  final  preparatory  confer  ence  for  the  “World  Conference  Against  Racism,  Racial  Discrimina  tion,  Xenophobia  and  Related  Intoler  ance”  is  slated  for  Geneva  on  30  July,  chaired  by  UN  High  Commissioner  for  Human  Rights  Mary  Robinson.   Irwin  Cotier,  a  leading  human  rights  lawyer,  law  professor  and  Canadian  parliamentarian,  gave  an  analysis  at  the  meeting  in  London  of  the  world’s  human  rights  community  in  general,  saying  that  Israel  has  become—for  some  of  this  communi  ty  —  nothing  less  then  the  antichrist.   Cotier  said  that  a  situation  is  developing  where  human  rights  is  the  new  religion,  and  Israel  is  the   enemy  of  that  religion  in  every  human  rights  sphere  —  whether  in  dealing  with  labour,  women’s  or  children’s  issues.   Melchior  said  that  the  proposals  being  discussed  now  are  far  worse  than  the  UN’s  Zionism  is  racism  dec  laration  of  the  1970s.  These  proposals  aim  not  only  to  delegitimise  the  state  of  Israel  through  equations  of  Zionism  with  racism,  racial  superiority,  and  the  “ethnic  cleansing  of  the  Arab  pop  ulation  in  historic  Palestine”,  but,  he  said,  they  also  aim  to  delegitimise  Jewish  death  and  suffering.   This  was  done  through  repeated  attempts  by  Arab  and  Asian  dele  gates  at  the  three  previous  prepara  tory  meetings  to  replace  all  references  to  “the  Holocaust”  with  “holocausts.”  For  example,  one  pro  posed  clause  reads  that  “We  are  con  scious  that  humanity’s  history  is  replete  with  terrible  wrongs  inflicted  through  lack  of  respect  for  the  equal  ity  of  human  beings  manifested  through  wars,  military  occupation  by  settlement,  and  settlement  poli  cies,  genocide,  slavery,  in  particular  transatlantic  slave  trade,  holocausts,  colonialism,  apartheid,  ethnic  cleansing  and  other  atrocities,  and  we  salute  the  memory  of  their  vic  tims.”  The  danger  behind  these  pro  posals  being  accepted,  is  that  this  will  be  the  future  terminology  that  will  be  used  in  reference  to  the  Pales  tinian-Israeli  conflict,  Melchior  said.   By  lumping  settlement  polices  together  with  other  evils,  is  to  water  down  the  concept  of  absolute  evil,  Melchior  said.   In  addition,  there  are  attempts  to  get  references  to  antisemitism  removed  from  the  draft  proposals,  and  even  an  attempt  to  condemn  “Zionist  practices  against  Semitism”.   The  danger  here,  Melchior  said,  is  that  “If  the  Jews  are  the  antisemites  —  as  this  type  of  wording  suggests  —  and  responsible  for  an  Arab  holo  caust,  then  you  can  say  that  they  real  ly  deserved  the  Holocaust  against  them.”  Currently,  there  is  no  attempt  to  organise  a  boycott  of  the  confer  ence,  partly  so  as  not  to  drive  a  rift  between  US  Jews  and  blacks.  Many  US  blacks  are  in  favour  of  the  confer  ence,  because  it  will  deal  with  the  issue  of  slavery,  and  even  demand  monetary  compensation.   “It  is  legitimate  to  criticise  the  state  of  Israel,”  Melchior  said.  “The  problem  is  that  when  you  do  it  at  a  conference  of  this  nature,  you  are  turning  Israel  into  an  absolute  evil.”  Israel,  Melchior  said  is  the  only  country  singled  out  for  treatment  in  these  resolutions.

"  Rosen  to  tackle  Jewish  Christian  problems   INTERNATIONALLY-renowned  interfaith  proponent  Rabbi  David  Rosen  will  focus  on  the  current   problems  being  experienced  by  Jews  throughout  the  world  resulting  from  Christian  misteachings  and  misunderstandings  during  a  visit  to  Sydney.   Rabbi  Rosen  will  deliver  the  B’nai  B’rith  Oration  entitled  “Christians  and  Jews  in  the  New  Millennium”  at  the  Wentworth  Hotel  on  May  13.   The  former  Director  of  the  Anti  Defamation  League’s  Israel  office  and  current  world  president  of  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  has  long  been  a  proponent  of  correcting  the  many  wrong  interpretations  of  religious  teachings  over  the  centuries.  In  addition,  he  has  spoken  out  against  Holocaust  denial  movements  and  in  particular  against  the  untruthful  Arab  propaganda  which  Great  Synagogue  Senior  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  deplored  at  a  Christian  Jewish  Luncheon  Club  meeting  in  Sydney  recently.   Rabbi  Rosen’s  visit  is  being   sponsored  by  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  and  the  B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commission.   Born  and  educated  in  Britain,  his  role  as  Director  of  Interfaith  Relations  of  the  Anti  Defamation   League  in  Israel  included   responsibility  for  its  liaison  with  the  Vatican.  As  a  result,  he  serves  on  the  Permanent  Bilateral  Commission  of  the  State  of  Israel  and  the  Holy  See.  He  is  also  a  member  of  the  International  Jewish  Committee  for  Inter-Religious  Consultations  which  represents  organised  World  Jewry  in  its  relations  with  other  world  religious  bodies.   NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  president  Henry  Mendelson  said  the  visit  would  enable  the  Anti-Defamation  Commission  and  the  Council  to  showcase  the  enormous  contribution  to  interfaith  relations  by  Rabbi  Rosen  throughout  a  distinguished  career  devoted  to  inter-religious  dialogue  and  consultation.   In  addition,  it  would  enable  a  wide  spectrum  of  audiences  to  become  aware  of  the  work  being  done  in  the  interfaith  arena  and  hopefully  to  be  supportive  of  it.   “It  will  undoubtedly  help  to  overcome  the  problems  of  limited  vision  and  knowledge  of  other  faiths  and  their  values.  Much  of  this  limited  knowledge  has  resulted  in  the  prejudices  of  the  past,”  he   said.

"  International   Zimbabwe  paper   claims  Jewish  plot   Michael  Belling   CAPE  TOWN  —  Accusations  of  an  Jewish  plot  to  destroy  Zimbabwe’s  economy  have  been  featured  promi  nently  in  a  newspaper  there.   The  Bulawayo  Chronicle,  which  supports  the  government  of  Zimbab  we  President  Robert  Mugabe,  pub  lished  a  3000-word  article  alleging  Jewish  responsibility  for  the  eco  nomic  problems  facing  Zimbabwe.   It  is  the  second  time  in  three  months  that  Jews  have  been  singled  out  there.  In  September,  Mugabe  was  quoted  as  saying:  “Jews  in  South  Africa,  working  in  cahoots  with  their  colleagues  here,  want  our  textile  and  clothing  factories  to  close  down.”   The  South  African  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  and  the  African  Jewish  Congress  condemned  Mugabe’s   remarks  as  racist  and  antisemitic.   Last  week’s  article,  headlined  “Company  closure  racket  unearthed”,  by  Innocent  Madonko,  focused  on  the  Broomberg  family  of  Bulawayo,  Zimbabwe’s  second  largest  city.   Madonko  alleged  that  the  col  lapse  of  the  family  company  —  once  the  country’s  leading  textile  manu  facturer  —  had  been  “engineered  by  a  closely-knit  community  of  Jews  with  interests  in  India,  Germany,  South  Africa,  Namibia  and  the  United   Kingdom”.  He  accused  the  “racket  eers”  of  being  part  of  a  wider  Jewish  conspiracy.   African  Jewish  Congress  chair  man  Mervyn  Smith  criticised  the  “pointed  and  gratuitous  references  to  the  fact  that  those  accused  of  mis  doings  are  members  of  the  Jewish  community”.   “The  effect  of  continually  pointing  this  out  is  to  create  the  erroneous  and  offensive  impression  that  there  is  a  Jewish-led  conspiracy  to  under  mine  the  Zimbabwean  economy.   “It  is  reminiscent  of  many  other  conspiracy  theories  that  have  been  invested  over  the  centuries  in  order  to  stir  up  hatred  against  the  Jewish  people,”  he  said.   There  are  800  Jews  in  Zimbabwe  —  500  in  the  capital,  Harare,  and  300  in  Bulawayo.  Two  decades  ago,  the  community  numbered  6000.   It  has  been  suggested  that  the  real  target  of  the  article  was  not  the  entire  community,  but  a  prominent  Zimbabwe  economist  and  business  consultant,  Eric  Bloch,  who  has  writ  ten  for  the  opposition  press  and  is  a  known  critic  of  Mugabe.   Over  the  past  few  years,  Zimbab  we  has  been  plunged  into  increas  ingly  autocratic  rule,  which  many  observers  believe  is  designed  to  keep  77-year-old  Mugabe  in  power.   He  has  ruled  Zimbabwe  for  21   |!|niC  ■  Zimbabwe  President  tyiXiL  Robert  Mugabe.   years,  and  has  tightened  his  grip  on  the  country,  authorising  the  seizure  of  white-owned  farms  in  a  bid  to  pla  cate  the  dissatisfied  black  popula  tion.  Hundreds  of  farms  have  been  invaded  by  self-styled  war  veterans  demanding  land  redistribution.   Zimbabwe’s  (Jewish)  Chief  Jus  tice,  Anthony  Gubbay,  resigned  ear  lier  this  year  under  government   pressure.   Press  freedom  and  the  main  opposition  party  are  under  govern  ment  threat,  with  the  editor  of  the  country’s  only  independent  newspa  per  being  arrested  last  week.   Moreover,  Zimbabwe’s  economy  has  been  in  a  tailspin.  Agricultural  production,  particularly  tobacco  —  the  main  source  of  revenue  —  has  fallen  dramatically,  and  industrial   production  is  suffering  as  well.   JTA ",2001-11-23
"  I  WAS  interested  to  read  of  Bern  Le  Hunte,  the  gifted  winner  of  the  NSW  Writers  Fellowship  (AJN  30/11/01).   As  a  member  of  the  Calcutta  com  munity  during  World  War  II,  1  am  fas  cinated  at  the  thought  that  someone  of  her  stature  will  write  about  the  remnants  of  that  once  high-achieving  community,  now  sadly  numbering  a  mere  50  souls.   Of  this  small  number,  almost  all  are  descendants  of  migrants  from  the  Middle  East  who  settled  in  the  city  during  the  19th  and  20th  centuries.   Some  30  Polish  Jews  were  given  asylum  in  Calcutta  in  1942,  en  route  to  Palestine.  One  of  them,  Bolek  Rembaum,  married  my  sister  Mercia  in  1945  and  lived  in  Calcutta  until  his  death  in  1975.  Their  descendants  live  in  the  UK  and  Israel.   No  Polish  Jews,  as  far  as  I  am  aware,  live  in  Calcutta  today.  Those  who  were  given  refuge  in  1942  and  are  alive  today  left  India  shortly  after  the  war.  The  larger  community  of  Middle  Eastern  origin,  which  numbered  about  4500  at  the  outbreak  of  the  war,  was  reduced  over  the  next  60  years  to  its  present  total  of  50.

"  Churches  sIM  on  antt-JMsh  lies   CHRISTIAN  churches  have  been  challenged  to  speak  out  against  the  “untruths”,  “insults”  and  “outrageous  allegations”  levelled  against  Judaism  and  Israel  by  pro  Arab  propagandists.   Australian  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  joint  president  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  says  the  mainstream  churches’  silence  is  the  latest  chapter  in  “a  sorry  history  of  Christian-Jewish  relations,  or  lack  of  them”,  which  has  seen  religious  leaders  in  Germany  ring  church  bells  for  Hitler  and  those  in  pre-1967  Jerusalem  look  the  other  way  as  occupying  Jordanian  forces  destroyed  synagogues  and  Jewish   cemeteries.   “There  are  glaring  lies  being  told,  such  as  the  notion  that  there  was  never  a  Jewish  Temple  on  Mount  Moriah  and  that  the  Temple  Mount  is  only  an  Islamic  site.  The  most  perfunctory  reading  of  the  Bible  disproves  this.  Why  doesn’t  someone  who  reads  the  Bible  stand  up  and  say  so?”   Attempts  by  the  Australian  Jewish  News  to  get  authoritative  Church   reactions  seemed  to  reinforce  Rabbi  Apple’s  comments.  The  head  of  the  Anglican  Church  in  Australia,  Perth’s  Archbishop  Peter  Camley,  was  not  available  for  comment  —  nor  was   his  representative,  Bishop  Brian   Farran.  The  Anglican  Church’s  media  unit  in  Sydney  was  unable  to  find  someone  to  comment,  and  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  was  “unable  to  prepare  a  statement  we  would  be  happy  with  in  the  time  available”.  The  Primate  of  the  Greek  Orthodox  Church  in  Australia,  Archbishop  Stylianos,  avoided  taking  Rabbi  Apple’s  criticisms  head-on,  saying:  “True  Christians,  particularly  true  Orthodox  [Christians]  are  100  per  cent  on  the  side  of  suffering  people  in  any  place  of  crisis,  whether  they  are  Jews  or  non-Jews;  faithful  or  non-faithful.”   However,  a  patron  of  the  Australian  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews,  Reverend  Professor  Davis  McCaughey,  said  reputable  Christian  scholars  agreed  that  claims  disputing  the  presence  of  Jewish  Temples  on  Mount  Moriah  were  “nonsense”.  But  the  Uniting  Church  minister  suggested  that  churches  may  be  shying  away  from  becoming  embroiled  in  a  political  controversy.   “We  live  in  a  time  when  it’s  very  difficult  to  get  intelligent  comments  by  any  religious  bodies  well  heard,  partly  because  none  of  us  like  standing  up  and  saying  that’s  awful  nonsense  because  we  know  that’s  going  to  land  us  in  controversy  ...  I  would  be  in  great  sympathy  with  my  Jewish  friends  who  would  say,  Well,  what  about  putting  an  article  in  such-and-such  a  publication  saying   Rabbi  Raymond  Apple   what  reputable  Christian  scholars   think?’”   Future  sovereignty  over  the  Temple  Mount  was  a  stumbling  block  in  peace  negotiations.  In  January,  the  Palestinian  Authority  affiliated  mufti  of  Jerusalem,  Ikrema  Sabri,  told  the  international  media  that  the  site  was  off  limits  to  all  non  Muslims.  But  while  some  Arab  archaeologists  dispute  the  existence  of  Jewish  Temples  there,  mainstream  archaeologists  fear  that  on-going  illegal  excavations  on  the  Temple  Mount  by  the  Muslim  authority  are  destroying  priceless  antiquities.   Known  as  a  political  moderate,  Rabbi  Apple,  who  is  senior  rabbi  at  the  Great  Synagogue,  told  the  AJN  he  was  surprised  and  disappointed  that  the  sympathetic  response  he  encountered  from  Christians  in   private  had  not  been  reflected  publicly.   Rabbi  Apple:  “I  would  have  thought  that  responsible  Christian  believers  would  have  thought  that  with  what’s  being  peddled  they  would  have  the  religious  and  moral  duty  to  speak  out.  I’m  afraid  there  seems  to  be  an  imbalance.  Jewish  leaders  automatically  speak  out  and  respond  when  they  see  that  something  unfair  and  unjust  is  being  said  anywhere  in  the  world,  but  it  doesn’t  happen  that  when  such  things  are  being  said  about  us  that  people  have  the  same  instinct  to  respond.”   He  told  a  meeting  of  the  Christian   Jewish  Luncheon  Club  last  week   that  Islamic  preaching  and  Palestinian  propaganda  had  included  a  mounting  series  of  insults  to  “Jewish  teaching,  Jewish  doctrine  and  Jewish  history”  including   Holocaust  denial  and  denial  of  the   Temple  in  Jerusalem  as  the  spiritual  focus  of  Jewish  worship.  “Christian  Church  people  could  and  should  be  the  first  to  stand  up  for  and  articulate  the  truth,”  he  said.  “The  cause  of  inter-religious  understanding  surely  demands  that  they  do  this,  and  do  it  urgently.”   Rabbi  Apple,  whose  father  was  born  in  Jerusalem  and  who  has  15  grandchildren  living  in  Israel,  told  the  AJN:  “I’m  speaking  of  the  mainstream  churches  and  I’m   speaking  of  those  who  make  their  interest  in  Christian-Jewish  dialogue  quite  obvious.  When  you  are  in  dialogue  with  someone  it  goes  without  saying  that  when  your  partner  in  dialogue  is  hurting,  you  also  feel  the  pain  ...  I’m  speaking  about  intellectual  pain  —  violence  against  the  truth.  Verbal  violence  is  also  violence,  and  from  verbal  violence  you  can  also  feel  terrible  hurt...  I  bring  up  this  issue  on  every  possible  level...  So  often,  the  private  response  is  very  understanding  or  sympathetic.  But  I’m  looking  for  a  much  more  open  and  public  response.”   Co-director  at  the  Australian  Institute  of  Holocaust  and  Genocide  Studies,  Paul  O’Shea,  said  that  Church  leaders  needed  to  have  the  problem  brought  to  their  attention.   “It’s  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  most  Christians  are  not  readers  of  fundamentalist  Islamic   propaganda.  When  it  does  occur,  I  suspect  the  normal  reaction  is  to  dismiss  it  for  what  it  is  —  that  it’s  hate  propaganda.  I  agree  that  it  should  be  condemned  and  spoken  out  against  by  Christian  leaders,”  the  senior  religious  education  co  ordinator  at  St  Patrick’s  Roman  Catholic  School,  Strathfield,  said.   Islamic  Council  of  New  South  Wales  chairman  Ali  Roude  declined  to  comment. ",2001-04-27
"  American-Jewish  nostalgia   ViDEO   Liberty  Heights   BARRY  Levinson  is  one  of  a  few  American   film  directors  who  use  their  Jewish  back  ground  as  a  source  of  material.   Best  known  for  his  Oscar-winning  Rain  Man  and  nomination  for  Bugsy,  Levinson  has  creat  ed  four  films  about  growing  up  Jewish  in  -Baltimore  —  Diner,  Tin  Men,  Avalon  and,  the   latest,  Liberty  Heights.  It  has  taken  18  months  to  arrive  in  Australia.  A  touching,  nostalgic  film,  it  has  gone  straight  to  video.   The  themes  of  Liberty  Heights  are  anti  semitism  and  religious  barriers,  exploring  how  a  Jewish  family  (the  Kurtzmans)  comes  to  terms  with  the  social,  racial  and  economic  changes  which  occurred  in  1950s  America.   The  film  seeks  to  convey  how  barriers  which  kept  Jews  and  others  apart  break  down.   Both  Kurtzman  sons  find  themselves  attract  ed  to  “other”  girls.  Van  and  his  friends  Yussel  and  Alan  attend  a  Halloween  party,  where  Van  is  smitten  by  a  blonde.  He  befriends  her  boyfriend,  and  discovers  that  they  are  afflicted  i&gt;y  low  self-esteem  and  alcohol  addiction.   Ben,  meanwhile,  becomes  attracted  to  Sylvia,  the  first  black  student  in  his  class.  Levinson  agains  turns  the  stereotypes  around,  for  Sylvia’s  family  is  aristocratic  —  her  father  is  a  doctor  and  she  is  the  third  generation  to  attend  university,  in  contrast  to  the  Kurtz  mans,  where  Van  and  Ben  are  the  first  to  do  so.   Liberty  Heights  also  tackles  antisemitism.  After  Yussel  is  beaten  up,  he  dyes  his  hair  blond  and  pretends  to  be  Scandinavian.   One  of  the  first  images  in  the  film  is  a  sign  at  an  exclusive  country  club  reading  “No  Jews,  Dogs  or  Coloreds  Allowed”,  prompting  Ben  and  his  friends  to  comment  on  the  order  of  those  prohibited  from  entering.   The  characters  are  well  drawn,  yet  Levinson  doesn’t  bring  it  all  together  into  a  coherent,  powerful  whole.  The  plot  wanders,  Levinson  never  quite  deciding  if  this  is  a  coming-of-age  story,  an  action-adventure,  a  social  commen  tary  or  a  statement  on  Jewish  identity.  None  of  the  many  strands  —  except  the  Sylvia-Ben  friendship  —  is  totally  satisfying.  Even  with  its  flaws,  however,  as  one  of  the  most  Jewish  American  films  to  emerge  of  late,  it  gives  view   ers  mucn  ro  ponaer.   Don  Pengin ",2001-08-24
"  Travelling  the  world  of  Jewish  music   Title:  A  Jewish  Odyssey  Artist:  Various   Reviewer:  Peter  Hollo   SUBTITLED  A  celebration  of   Jewish  music  around  the  world,  this  is  not  just  a  compilation  of  Chanukah  songs,  or  Israeli  music,  or  new  klezmer;  it  attempts  to  survey  all  Jewish  musical  styles  from  a  global  perspective.   The  booklet  that  comes  with  the  CD,  Roots,  splits  the  music  of  the  Diaspora  into  three  main  categories  —  Ashkenazi  (including  klezmer),  Sephardic  (Mediterranean  styles)  and  Mizrachi  (music  of  Arabic  Jews).  Of  course,  none  of  these  remains  as  a  pure  form;  popular  Israeli  music  mixes  them  up,  along  with  Western  pop  and  folk  music  influences.   So,  you  ask,  does  the  selection  of  music  stand  up  to  these  aims  and,  more  important,  does  it  amount  to  an  interesting  and  enjoyable  listen?  The  answer  is  yes  and  no.   If  you’re  expecting  the  liveliness  and  extremes  of  emotion  associated  with  klezmer  and  klezmer-derived  music,  you  may  be  disappointed.  Much  of  the  album  has  that  kind  of  “generalised-world-music”  vibe  —   subtle  Middle  Eastern  percussion,  acoustic  guitars  and  soft-focus  pro  duction.  Even  the  Klezmer  Conservatory  Band  turns  in  a  track  that,  with  its  mandolin  and  percus  sion,  sounds  more  Middle  Eastern  than  Eastern  European  (it’s  one  of  the  best,  a  successful  melding  of  two  Jewish  traditions).   Chava  Alberstein  &amp;  the  Klezmatics  contribute  a  track  from  their  1998  col  laboration  Di  Krenitse,  the  only  Yiddish  song  on  the  CD,  a  lullaby  in  which  the  usual  flamboyant  avant  rock/jazz  Klezmatics  arrangements  are  subdued  into  something  more  acoustic  and  classical-bounding.  And  Finjan,  from  Canada,  manage  to  make  a  1920s  klezmer  tune  sound  like  a  cross  between  pastoral  Celtic  and  Chinese  music.  Pleasant  enough,  but  lacking  somehow.   The  late  Ofra  Haza’s  track  is  unmis  takably  her  own,  yet  with  its  acoustic  guitars  and  percussion,  doesn’t  make  much  of  an  impression.   Many  of  the  Sephardic  tracks  in  particular  don’t  get  much  past  being  background  music  —  even  Zohar,   who  sometimes  add  DJ  Olive’s  sam   pling  and  turntables  to  their  jazz  key   boards  and  Moroccan   percussion/vocals,  sound  like  Middle   Eastem-taxidriver  music.   All  the  tracks  on  the  album  are  love  ly  ...  yet  most  are,  sadly,  unremarkable  as  well.  There  are  none  of  the  exqui  site  twists  and  turns  of  a  Giora  Feidman  clarinet  solo,  none  of  the  Gypsy  freedom  of  Polish  acoustic  klezmer  trio  Kroke  or  the  experimen  tal  downtown  New  York  sounds  you  would  find  on  John  Zorn’s  Tzadik  label.  It’s  enjoyable,  but  it  won’t  stay  at  the  top  of  the  pile  for  long  —  a  shame,  considering  the  real  treasures,  both  traditional  and  innovative,  in  the  Jewish  musical  world.

"  !  Jewish  students  must  get  political   i   i   VIEWPOINT   TOE  national  conference  of  the  National  Union  of  students  (NUS)  was  held  from  December  10-16,  2000.  Ordinarily,  one  might  question  the  impact  that  a  student  body,  created  to  represent  stu  dents  on  campuses  across  Australia  in  educa  tion-related  issues,  might  have  upon  the  Jewish  community.  That  conference  answered  the  question  all  too  clearly.   In  a  well-orchestrated  stunt,  several  individu  als  attempted  to  use  the  conference  to  pass  a  series  of  anti-Israel  resolutions.  These  motions   not  only  referred  to  Israel  as  practising  genocide  against  Palestinians,  but  went  further,  calling  for  the  trial  of  Israeli  leaders  for  “war  crimes”.  And,  in  another  case,  a  motion  was  written  to  autho  rise  the  donation  of  student  money  to  the  Friends  of  Palestine  —  an  Australian-based  stu  dent  organisation  which  infamously  equates  Zionism  with  Nazism  and  has  recently  organised  rallies  against  Israel.   Fortunately,  cooler  heads  and  a  “Jewish  cau  cus”  (comprising  10  of  the  190  voting  delegates)   ensured  that  these  motions  were  never  put  to  the  vote.  However,  such  a  strong  position  is  untenable,  considering  the  fluid  nature  of  stu  dent  politics,  where  individuals  are  involved  for  only  a  couple  of  years.  Further,  a  general  lack  of  interest  shown  by  the  majority  of  Jewish  stu  dents,  to  the  degree  that  they  do  not  even  vote  at  university  elections,  makes  organising  a  “Jewish”  position  difficult—we  do  not  have  the  numbers.  This  despite  numerous  paid  jobs  on  offer  within  the  student  movement,  and  access   University  students  (rear)  Jeremy  Benson  and  Marlssa  Frydman,  (front)  Glia  Levitan,  Debbie  Wiseman,  Tammy  Rosman  and  Ryan  Kaplan.   to  journalists,  government  and  business.   This  scenario  is  not  new.  In  the  1960s,  a  small  number  of  Jewish  students  joined  a  couple  of  existing  groups  to  stop  the  AUS  (Australian  Union  of  Students  —  predecessor  to  NUS)  from  donating  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars  to  the  PLO.  These  donations  were  secret,  and  are  still  denied  by  many  who  participated  in  the  AUS  at  the  time.  The  AUS  was  destroyed,  setting  back  Australian  student  politics  and  student  issues.  Out  of  the  ashes  rose  NUS,  only  to  be  confronted  by  the  same  issues.   It  seems  as  though  there  are  people  who  do  not  learn  the  lessons  of  history  and  are  continu  ing  to  use  the  student  movement  for  their  own   nefarious  purposes.  There  are  many  who  fear  that  if  NUS  is  dissolved,  there  will  be  no  replace  ment  —  the  ability  of  students  to  represent  themselves  would  be  lost.  For  that  reason,  it  is  essential  that  student  politics  not  be  left  to  those  fringe  elements  which  seek  to  assault  our  values   Ensuring  that  our  votes  count   towards  stopping  antisemites  from   promoting  their  agendas  with   student  money  is  a  worthy  cause.   and  will  cause  the  end  of  NUS.   In  England,  UJS  (the  Union  of  Jewish  Students)  is  the  largest  political  faction  within  the  National  Union  of  Students.  Extremely  high  Jewish  voter  turnout,  combined  with  a  sense  of  urgency  to  stop  anti-Israel  motions  being  passed,  has  ensured  that  English  Jewish  students  dominate  student  politics.  That  scenario  would  be  all  too  easy  to  emulate  in  Australia.  Voter  turnout  on  New  South  Wales  campuses  never  reaches  high  er  than  one  in  ten,  and  often  is  as  low  as  one  in  30.  Ensuring  Jewish  student  votes  for  Jewish  activists  would  create  a  position  of  strength  within  the  union,  from  which  we  could  put  our  point  of  view.   To  this  end,  it  was  envisaged  that  ideally,  an  “AUJS”  (Australasian  Union  of  Jewish  Students)  faction  would  be  created  to  contest  university  elections.  Those  elected  would  ensure  that  anti  semitic  and  anti-Zionist  articles  do  not  appear  in  the  university  newspapers  (as  happens  all  too  regularly)  and  that  student  money  is  not  used  to  fund  causes  harmful  to  the  Jewish  community.   The  idea  was  dropped  for  lack  of  candidates  to  contest  elections  and  a  strong  fear  of  poor  voting  numbers,  which  would  humiliate  the  cause  for  which  we  were  fighting.  Rather,  we  would  call  on  Jews  at  university  to  join  existing  student  political  factions  and  run  for  election  through  them,  or  to  give  their  votes  to  fellow   Jews.   This  year,  instead  of  avoiding  the  political  clubs  on  campus  during  Orientation  Week,  I  advocate  joining  one.  Ensuring  that  our  votes  count  towards  stopping  antisemites  from  pro  moting  their  agendas  with  student  money  is  a  worthy  cause.  Alternatively,  I  call  on  university  aged  Jews  to  get  elected  and  make  some  money.

"  $250,000  grant  for   Jewish  museum   CBiarafcal  Abttbo!   THE  Federal  Government  has  announced  a   $250,000  grant  for  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  to  upgrade  disability  access,  should  it  be  returned  in  the  November  10  election.   Announcing  the  grant,  Wentworth  Liberal  Party  candidate  Peter  King  said  he  had  seen  the  problem  first-hand,  and  had  concluded  that  “better  access  for  people  with  disabilities  and  the  aged  is  vital  for  the  museum’s  future”.   He  has  raised  the  issue  at  government  level  in  recent  months,  he  added.  “The  Prime  Minister  and  the  Liberal  Party  strongly  support  the  museum  and  its  role  in  reminding  Australians  of  the  horrors  of  the  Holocaust  and  the  contribution  that  the  Jewish  community  has  made  to  our  nation.”   The  use  to  which  the  funds  would  be  put  is  under  deliberation,  with  the  museum  considering  two  options  —  building  a  hydraulic  lift  or  utilising  the  lift  in  the  NSW  Jewish  Memorial  Building  next-door,  effectively  joining  the  two  centres.   A  series  of  ramps  would  be  installed  to  connect  all  nine  levels  of  the  museum,  as  well  as  handrails  and  wheelchair-accessible  toilets.   Sydney  Jewish  Museum  president  John  Roth  said  the  grant  would  meet  a  dual  purpose.  “Our  guides,  who  are  largely  Holocaust  survivors,  are  what  makes  this  museum  unique,  and  we  want  to  enable  them  to  continue  guiding  as  long  as  possible.   “We  also  want  to  enable  members  of  the  public  who  have  disabilities  to  access  all  part  of  the  museum.”   The  museum  currently  provides  a  manual  wheelchair  lifting  service.  However,  “it’s  a  difficult  process”,  Mr  Roth  said,  pointing  out  that  a  person  with  a  disability  who  wants  to  visit  the  current  exhibition  on  the  Jews  of  Shanghai  —  located  on  the  top  level  —  would  have  to  be  “extremely  determined”.   Wentworth  Labor  Party  candidate  Carolyn  Neilson  was  unable  to  say  whether  a  Labor  government  would  match  the  $250,000  grant  —  and  warned  voters  to  be  wary  of  pre  election  promises.   “In  the  weeks  leading  to  election,  this  government  is   trying  to  pull  out  big  promises  to  win  the  support  of  communities,”  she  said.  “Communities   are  aware   when   desperate  promises  are  made  by  a   desperate   government.  Ultimately,  they  must  judge  the  commitment  and  attitude  of  this  government  over  the  past  six  years.”   Ms  Neilson  added  that  she  supports  equal  access.  “If  I  was  a  member  of  parliament,  I  would  support  an  issue  of  this  nature,  and  not  just  in  the  two  weeks  leading  to  the   election.” ",2001-11-02

The  conference  has  become  the  subject  of  intense  lobbying  over  efforts  by  an  Arab  bloc  to  tarnish  Israel  as  a  racist  state.   The  United  States  has  threatened  to  boycott  the  conference,  as  it  did  at  the  two  previous  conferences  against  racism,  in  1978  and  1983.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  national  vice-president  Jeremy  Jones  has  been  named  as  part  of  the  Australian  delegation  by  virtue  of  his  ECAJ  role,  his  position  as  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  international  director  and  his  involvement  in  Australian  non  government.  organisations  working  to  further  human  rights.   Australia’s  23-strong  delegation  will  be  led  by  Immigration  and  Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  Philip  Ruddock  and  will  include   Jeremy  Jones   Democrats  Senator  Aden  Ridgeway.   Mr  Jones  is  the  only  Jewish  member.  “When  I  represent  the  Jewish  community,  I  wear  a  kipa,”  he  said.  “It  says  something  positive  about  Australia  that  there  are  people  from  Asian,  Greek  and  indigenous  backgrounds  on  the  delegation  because  they  are  seen  by  our  government  as  doing  something  within  the  Australian  community  which  is  worthwhile  promoting.”   Mr  Jones  will  present  papers  on  Holocaust  denial,  hate  on  the  internet  and  antisemitism.   While  he  is  representing  Australia,  he  aims  also  to  “ensure  that  there  is  a  constructive  Jewish  contribution.  There  may  be  times  where  you  have  to  stand  out  because  you’re  being  attacked,  but  you’re  not  going  there  to  do  that.  I’m  not  going  to  say  we  have  to  save  Israel  or  Jews  in  every  corner.  You  do  that  when  it’s  necessary,  but  there  might  be  a  discussion  with  people  of  different  backgrounds  worldng  together  on  different  issues  and  I  can  give  best-practice  experience  from  Australia.”   Mr  Jones  was  unaware  of  any  Australians  suggesting  that  Australia  boycott.  “The  issue  is  our  level  of  representation  and  what  we  do  once  we  get  there.”   He  declined  to  be  drawn  on  whether  he  viewed  the  American   threat  to  boycott  as  appropriate.   The  conference  will  be  preceded  by  a  Youth  Forum  and  a  NGO  Forum,  with  Mr  Jones  representing  the  World  Jewish  Congress,  and  Dr  Geulah  Solomon  representing  the   International  Council  of  Jewish  Women,  at  the  latter.

"  Samantha  Baita   FOUR  Carmel  School  Year  12  students  were  attacked  and  subjected  to  antisemitic  taunts  while  walking  home  from  a  Shabbaton  at  the  Chabad  House  of  Perth  recently.   The  three  males,  wearing  kipot,  and  one  female  were  walking  home  in  the  suburb  of  Dianella  after  a  Shabbat  service  and  meal  at  about  12.30am,  when  a  car  drove  past  and  occupants  shouted  “bloody  Jews”.   The  car  then  dropped  off  two  males,  who  approached  the  students  and  demanded  money.  According  to  the  father  of  one  of  the  students,  they  said  they  were  not  carrying  money  because  of  the  Sabbath.  One  of  the  men  forcibly  removed  the  kipa  from  one  of  the  students,  called  him  a  “bloody  Jew”  ,  and  punched  him  on  the  side  of  the   head,  knocking  him  down.   In  the  meantime,  the  female  student  and  one  male  student  had  run  to  her  home,  a  kilometre  away.  The  remaining  student  was  also  punched  in  the  face,  and  one  of  the  assailants  threatened  him  with  a  knife.   “He  flicked  the  knife  at  him  and   my  son  lent  back,  but  the  knife  cut  the  inside  of  his  jacket  and  shirt,”  the  victim’s  father  related.  “He  realised  the  situation  was  getting  serious  and  managed  to  fight  off  both  the  guys  until  the  car  came  back  and  picked  the  men  up.”   The  two  students  walked  to  the  female  student’s  home  and  then  returned  to  Chabad  House,  where  they  stayed  overnight.   The  victim’s  father  said  his  son  had  suffered  an  injured  knee,  as  a  result  of  being  kicked,  and  he  had  been  on  crutches.  His  hand  and  face   were  also  injured.   Jewish  Community  Council  of  Western  Australia  president  Ron  Samuel  described  the  attack  as  a  “wake-up  call  to  the  Perth  community”  and  said  there  was  no   doubt  that  it  was  antisemitic  in  intent.  Yet  some  of  the  victims’  families  and  the  investigating  police  say  they  do  not  believe  it  was  racially  motivated.   “It  was  an  antisemitic  attack,  but  I’m  not  sure  the  kids  were  attacked  specifically  because  they  were  Jewish,”  the  victim’s  father  said.   “We’ve  taken  reports  from  three  youths  about  this  incident,  and  we’ll  be  tracking  them  down  for  statements,”  Mirrabooka  Police  Detective  Sergeant  Steve  Potter  said.  “It  doesn’t  look  like  an  antisemitic  incident.  It  looks  like  a   carload  of  people  tried  to  get  some  money  off  them  and  it  turned  into  a   scuffle.  When  we  get  full  statements,  more  information  may  come  to  light.  The  youths  didn’t  get  a  clear  look  at  the  car,  so  there  is  not  a  great  likelihood  of  anyone  getting  caught.”   According  to  Mr  Samuel,  the  verbal  abuse  confirmed  that  the  attack  was  racially  motivated.  “When  someone  takes  a  kipa  off  a  young  boy’s  head  and  calls  him  ‘bloody  Jew’,  it  is  an  antisemitic  attack.  I’ve  been  expecting  something  like  this  and  I’ve  been  warning  my  community,  but  until  something  like  this  happens,  no-one  listens.  The  community  should  not  be  looking  at  changing  their  lifestyles,  but  they  should  be  aware  that  security  issues  are  becoming  more  important.  Hopefully  this  will  be  a  wake-up  call.”   Shabbaton  organiser  Brocha  Katz,  a  youth  worker  from  New  York  who   has  been  working  with  Perth  Chabad  for  ten  months,  was  “shocked”  when  the  students  returned  to  Chabad  House.   “I  never  suspected  that  Dianella  was  like  that,”  she  said.  “I  come  from  New  York,  so  it  wasn’t  an  eye  opener  for  me,  but  the  way  it  has  shocked  the  town  —  it  must  have  been  a  big  thing.”   Mr  Samuel  pointed  to  the  rise  of  pro-Palestinian  articles  in  the  media  and  the  resurgence  of  right-wing  groups  like  One  Nation  and  the  Australia  First  Party,  led  by  Graeme  Campbell,  in  Perth  as  an  object  of  concern  for  the  community.   “The  community  has  every  reason  to  be  apprehensive.  Pauline  Hanson’s  reaction  to  Graeme  Campbell  proves  that  she  never  had  control  of  the  party.  It  proves  that  her  party  is  being  run  by  right-wing  racist  groups.” ",2001-06-01
"  Bernard  Flreedman   MAJOR  differences  on  issues  of  direct  concern  to  Jewish  Australians  have  emerged  in  Coalition  and  Labor  Party  policies.   The  differences  are  apparent  in  responses  to  nine  questions  put  to  the  two  parties  by  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry,  with  the  Coalition  relying  largely  on  its  record  in  government  and  Labor  signalling  several  key  changes.   Domestic  issues  produced  the  sharpest  points  of  difference  —  on  funding  for  Jewish  dayschools;  tax  relief  for  communities  in  dealing  with  racist  violence  and  terrorism;  the  need  for  a  complaints  procedure  covering  SBS  (the  Special  Broad  casting  Service);  and  immigration.   The  parties  were  also  asked  to  explain  their  policies  on  the  Israeli  Palestinian  conflict;  multi  culturalism;  prosecution  of  war  criminals;  the  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunity  Commission;  and  weapons  of  mass  destruction.   Israeli-Palestinian  conflict   The  Coalition  says  Australia,  not  being  a  major  regional  player,   cannot  be  involved  as  a  mediator  in  negotiations,  but  it  can  contribute  through  aid,  rhetorical  support  for  the  peace  process,  refusing  to  accept  unbalanced  UN  resolutions  critical  of  Israel,  and  maintaining  its  participation  in  the  peacekeeping  force  in  Sinai  and  in  observer  forces.   Labor  links  the  conflict  to  inter  national  terrorism  and  says  the  “danger  posed  by  the  situation  in   the  Middle  East”  must  be  recognised.   It  feels  that  Australia  must  ensure   that  “the  campaign  against  terrorism  is  matched  by  efforts  to  address  the  circumstances  that  help  breed  extremism”.   It  believes  that  an  effective  ceasefire,  cessation  of  terrorism  and  hostile  propaganda,  and  a  return  by  Israel  and  the  Palestinians  to  genuine  negotiation  are  immediate  priorities.   Labor  reiterates  its  strong  support  for  Israel’s  right  to  exist  and  the  Palestinians’  right  of  self  determination  and  an  independent   state.   Dayschools   The  Coalition  says  its  socio  economic  status  (SES)  funding  arrangements  for  non-government  schools  benefit  Jewish  dayschools  with  increased  funding.   It  says  Labor’s  funding  formula  threatens  the  dayschools  because  it  takes  a  school’s  capital  resources  and  fee  levels  into  account.   But  Labor  says  it  will  maintain  current  funding  levels  throughout  the  present  four-year  period  for  all  schools,  except  those  in  Category  1,  which  means  that  no  Jewish  school  will  be  adversely  affected.   Labor  says  that  after  2004,  it  will  review  the  SES,  which  classifies  schools  such  as  Yeshiva  College  as  being  wealthier  than  Kings.  Communal  security   The  Coalition  and  Labor  had  sharply  different  approaches  on  supporting  tax  relief  to  enable  communities  to  provide  security  against  racist  and  terrorist  violence  in  addition  to  that  provided  by  the  states  and  federal  bodies.   The  Coalition  pointed  to  existing  federal,  state  and  territory  arrangements  to  deal  with  racist  and  terrorist  violence,  and  to  civil  and  criminal  penalties  and  compensation  for  victims  of  crime.   Labor  said  it  intends  to  establish  an  Office  of  Community  Safety  and  Community  Safety  Zones  costing  $93  million  over  four  years  to  deal  with  high  levels  of  crime  and  low  levels  of  community  safety  and  policing  “in  areas  of  greatest  need”.  SBS  complaints   Asked  whether  the  parties  would  amend  SBS  legislation  to  introduce  an  independent  complaints  procedure  to  deal  with  material  broadcast  in  non-English  languages  as  well  as  English,  the  Coalition  asserted  that  current  SBS  procedure  deals  with  complaints,  irrespective  of  the  language  in  which  material  was  broadcast.   Labor  said  it  would  work  with  SBS  to  establish  an  independent  review  of  complaints  regarding  SBS  programming,  similar  to  the  ABC’s  independent  review  of  complaints  of  bias  or  lack  of  balance.   Labor  would  work  with  SBS  to   First-time  voter  Eva  Agaml  deliberated  for  weeks  before  casting  her  ballot  early  to  avoid  breaking  Shabbat.  The  University  of  NSW  first-year  Medical  Science  student  made  her  decision  the  night  before  voting.  “My  main  concern  was  how  the  parties  deal  with  Israel.  I  want  a  government  that  Is  sensitive  to  Israel’s  needs  because  that  reflects  back  on  how  we  are  treated  In  Australian   society  as  Jews  and  how  our  media  deals  with  the  situation  there.”  Photo:  Ingrid  Shakenovsky   provide  translation  services  to  determine  the  content  of  programs  and  deal  with  complaints  made  in  languages  other  than  English.   Immigration   Neither  party  dealt  specifically  with  humanitarian  immigration.   The  Coalition  repeated  its  election  mantra  that  it  is  any  nation’s  right  to  determine  who  enters  the  country.  It  linked  its  policies  of  “orderly  migration”  —  including  refugees  —  to  continuing   Continued  page  30   Jewish  issues?  Where  the  parties  stand   Continued  from  page  1   community  support  which  it  says  depends  on  border  control  and  the  integrity  of  migration  and  resettlement  programs.   Labor  sees  immigration  as  part  of  a  long  term  population  policy  developed  through  an  Office  of  Population,  rather  than  the  result  of  political  decisions  about  immigration  levels.   But  it  also  asserts  that  community  support  for  Australia’s  immigration  programs  will  depend  on  effective  solutions  to  the  problems  of  people-smuggling  and  illegal  immigration.   It  plans  “to  protect  Australia  from  the  tide  of  illegal  immigrants”  and  crack  down  on  people  smugglers  with  an  Australian  Coast  Guard  “on  the  beat  every  day  of  the  year”  and  discus  sions  with  the  Indonesian  Government  to  establish  proper  refugee  processing  and  a  bilateral  agreement  against  people-smuggling.  War  crimes   The  Coalition,  overlooking  that  while  in  opposition  in  1988,  it  strongly  opposed  legisla  tion  to  prosecute  alleged  Nazi  criminals  in  Australia,  says  it  is  now  “strongly  committed  to  bringing  alleged  war  criminals  to  justice”.   It  will  ratify  the  Statute  of  the  International  Criminal  Court  to  make  genocide  and  all  offences  within  the  court’s  jurisdiction   offences  in  Australian  law.   Labor  is  committed  to  quickly  ratifying  the  Statute  of  the  International  Criminal  Court  and  wants  genocide  to  be  a  crime  in  Australian  domestic  law.  It  supports  extradition  treaties  and  the  power  to  refuse  or  revoke  visas  where  there  is  a  record  of  war  crimes.   Labor  believes  the  Australian  Federal  Police  should  continue  any  “currently  open”  investi  gations  into  war  crimes;  however,  the  last  annual  war  crimes  report  said  there  were  no  current  investigations.  Human  rights   The  Coalition  stands  on  its  record  on  the  future  of  the  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunity  Commission  (HREOC)  and  its  role  in  administering  anti-discrimination  laws.   This  covers  legislative  and  policy  changes  affecting  pregnant  women  in  the  workplace,  binding  decisions  in  anti-discrimination  actions  in  the  Federal  Court  or  Federal  Magistrate’s  Service,  amendments  to  the   Disability  Discrimination  Act  to  set  standards  for  disabled  access  to  premises  and  educating  the  community  about  their  rights  and  respon   sibilities.   Labor  claims  it  will  “revitalise”  the  role  of  HREOC,  saying  the  Commission’s  capacity  has  been  “hamstrung  by  the  Howard  government’s  decision  to  ban  Commissioners  from  acting  as   advocates  in  discrimination  cases”.   Labor  would  make  more  use  of  the  Commission  to  conduct  public  inquiries  and  report  on  nationally  significant  human  rights  issues.  It  would  also  seek  the  Commission’s  views  on  legislation.  Multiculturalism   The  Coalition’s  vision  of  how  Australia  could  build  on  multiculturalism  and  cultural  diversi  ty  is  contained  in  its  policy,  “Australian  Multiculturalism”.   This  emphasises  what  it  calls  cultural  diver  sity  and  inclusiveness  —  the  right  of  all  Australians  to  maintain  their  cultural  tradi  tions  as  active  and  equal  participants  in  Australian  society.   Labor  strongly  supports  the  principle  and  practice  of  multiculturalism  as  a  social  policy,  recognising  and  respecting  cultural  diversity  as  “an  enormous  asset”  enhancing  Australia’s  ability  to  compete  in  the  international  market  place.   It  believes  governments  must  play  a  leader  ship  role  with  appropriate  anti-discrimination  legislation  and  community  education  pro  grams  to  combat  intolerance,  racism  and  dis  advantage.  Weapons   The  Coalition  sees  the  proliferation  of  mis  siles  and  weapons  of  mass  destruction  as  “per  haps  the  greatest  danger  facing  us”.  It  will  sup  port  all  moves  to  control  weapons  prolifera  tion  and  to  protect  Australians  from  the  threat  they  pose.   Labor  says  combatting  the  spread  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction  is  a  key  priority  and  a  direct  contribution  to  combatting  inter  national  terrorism.  It  says  it  will  return  Australia  to  the  forefront  of  international  efforts  to  advance  non-proliferation  and  disar  mament,  “a  role  seriously  neglected  by  the  Howard  government”.

"  Demonstrators  march  towards  the  Israeli  Consulate  In  Sydney.   Photos:  Chantal  Abitbol   Jewish  protestors  join  rally  against  Israel   A  HANDFUL  6f  Jews  joined  Arab  protestors  in  Sydney  to  demand  an  end  to  Israel’s  “occupation”  of  Palestinian  territory  and  a  “right  to  return”  for  Palestinian  refugees.   As  Jews  throughout  the  world  prepared  to  celebrate  Passover,  the  150-strong  assembly  marched  to  the  building  which  houses  the  Israeli  Consulate.  About  10  Jewish  demonstrators  carried  a  banner  declaring  “Jews  Support  Palestine,  End  the  Occupation”,  while  other  protestors,  waving  Palestinian  flags,  chanted  “No  return,  no  peace”.   About  150  Palestinian  supporters  also  marched  in  Melbourne  as  part  of  a  day  of  protest  that  included  rallies  in  New  York,  Canada  and  Spain.   The  turn-out  in  both  Sydney  and  Melbourne  was  a  far  cry  from  the  expected  number  of  1000  participants  which  organisers  had  predicted.   Said  Marta  Romer,  who  helped  to  co-ordinate  the  Jewish  presence  at  the  Sydney  rally:  “We’re  here  as  Jews  who  support  the  end  of  Israeli  occupation  and  human  rights  abuses  against  Palestinians.  A  lot  of  Jews  in  Sydney  and  around  the  world  think  this  way,  but  don’t  march.”   Organised  by  the  Palestine  Human  Rights  Campaign,  the  rally  coincided  with  the  53rd  anniversary  of  Deir  Yassin  —  a  battle  during  Israel’s  War  of  Independence  in  which  a  reported  250  Arabs,  many  of  them  non  combatants,  were  killed.  Described  by   Continued  page  32   Jewish  protestors  join  protest  against  Israel   Continued  from  page  1   rally  organiser  Sari  Kassis  as  a  “massacre”,  he  said  Deir  Yassin  was  one  of  a  number  of  episodes  that  led  to  Palestinians  being  “expelled  or  chased  out  of  their  homeland”,  contributing  to  what  he  called  the  “largest  refugee  problem  in  the  world”.   Ms  Romer  said  she  supports  the  Palestinian  claim  of  a  “right  to  return”  and  condemned  Israel  for  using  what  she  deemed  excessive  force.  “Palestinians  are  a  dispossessed  people  living  under  Israeli  control,”  she  said;  “I  view  with  hor  ror  the  consequences  of  military  repression  and  economic  blockade  of  the  Palestinians  by  Israel.”   Demanding  a  withdrawal  from  all  territories  captured  by  Israel  in  the  1967  Six-Day  War,  she  called  for  the  abolition  of  “discriminatory”  laws  and  the  establishment  of  an  international  aid  pro  gram  to  rehabilitate  Palestinian  communities.   Once  a  member  of  Women  in  Black—a  coali  tion  of  Arab  and  Jewish  activists  which  formed  after  the  1991  Gulf  War  and  folded  two  years  ago  —  Ms  Romer  expressed  concern  at  being  dis  criminated  against  by  members  of  the  Jewish  community,  saying  some  people  label  her  a  “self  hating  Jew”  because  of  her  political  beliefs.  “You  can  think  what  you  like,  but  you  can’t  say  it  pub  licly  without  your  Jewish  identity  being  ques  tioned.  It’s  almost  as  if  there’s  only  one  permissi  ble  way  to  think,  and  your  allegiance  to  Israel’s  policies  is  what  defines  who  you  are  as  a  Jew.”   Added  Jewish  marcher  Su  Goldfish:  “I’m  the  daughter  of  a  Jewish  refugee,  and  I  know  what  it’s  like  to  not  be  given  permission  to  belong  some  where.  You  have  to  take  stand  towards  injustice  and  pursue  human  rights  for  all.”   Before  the  march,  participants  gathered  out  side  Town  Hall,  setting  out  banners  with  the  message  “Stop  Israeli  Apartheid”  and  “Free  Palestine”,  while  copies  of  the  Australasian  Spartacist  with  the  headline  “Down  With  Zionist   Terror  Machine”  were  distributed.   A  police  vehicle  later  cleared  the  way  as  a  truck  carrying  loudspeakers  blared  such  chants  as  “Refugee  rights  are  a  human  right”  and  led  the  convoy  towards  the  Israeli  Consulate,  which  was  closed.  Speakers  included  Palestinian  activist  Susan  Nasser,  NSW  National  Union  of  Students  president  Ryan  Heath  and  Mr  Kassis.  Followed  by  a  moment  of  silence  to  remember  Arabs  killed  in  the  conflict  with  Israel,  the  march  ended  peacefully  with  no  incidents  of  flag-burning,  as  occurred  in  similar  such  rallies  last  year.   Said  UNSW  Political  Science  senior  lecturer  Ephraim  Nimni,  who  participated:  “I’m  an  Israeli  who  supports  Palestinian  rights  to  self-determi  nation  and  a  two-state  solution  where  Israelis  and  Arabs  co-exist  on  equal  terms.”   According  to  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  executive  director  Dr  Colin  Rubenstein,  the  Palestinian  claim  of  a  “right  to  return”  means  the  “liquidation  of  Israel”.  “The  problem  we  had  in  1948  is  still  the  bottomline  —  total  right  of  return  for  Palestinian  refugees  and  descendants.  This  assertion  brings  into  question  Israel’s  legiti  mate  right  to  exist  and  indicates  Palestinians  are  not  willing  to  settle  alongside  Israel.   “Do  Palestinians  have  a  right  to  return  to  their  own  country?  Of  course,  but  until  Palestinians  give  up  the  dream  of  destroying  Israel,  there’s  no  early  prospect  of  a  genuine  end  to  the  conflict.”   As  for  accusations  of  excessive  force,  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  vice-president  David  Knoll  said:  “A  people  who  act  in  self-defence  can  not  be  fairly  labelled  oppressors.  Israel’s  insis  tence  on  peace  and  security  is  not  the  cause  of  Palestinian  suffering;  and  until  people  refrain  from  violence,  there  will  be  no  climate  for  peace.   “While  we  have  sympathies  for  families  of  civil  ians  killed  at  Deir  Yassin,  I’d  like  to  see  those  who  marched  express  regret  for  the  Jewish  victims  of   Arab  terrorism.”   &amp;lt;4  a_:i  nnA4 ",2001-04-13
"  Holiness  through  Jewish  blessings   ASK  THE  RABBI   Rabbi  Raymond  Apple   Jtv   IT  has  actually  happened,  countless  times.  Someone  called  to  the  Torah  has  said  the  wrong  brachah  —  not  asher  bachar  banu...  but  hamotzi  lechem  min  ha’aretz,  boreip’rihagafen  or  even  asher  kid’shanu  b’mitzvotav  v’tzivanu  al  achilat  maror.  Clearly,  instinct  —  or  what  the  Talmud  calls  girsa  d’yankuta,  the  knowledge  acquired  as  a  child  (Shabbat  21b),  has  been  at  work.  Saying  a  brachah  —  even  the  wrong  one  —  is  second  nature  to  a  Jew.  It’s  good  that  bra  chot  learned  in  childhood  later  come  so  natu  rally.   Who  established  the  blessings?  The  Mish  ■4  yah  lays  down  which  brachot  to  say  and  when;   the  words  of  the  brachot  are  from  a  mosaic  of  sources;  but  the  concept  originates  in  parashat  Ekev:  “You  shall  eat  and  be  satisfied,  and  bless  the  Lord  your  God”  (Deuteronomy  8:10).  Though  this  verse  commands  us  to  bless  God  after  eating,  the  sages  say,  “If,  when  a  person  is  full  he  blesses  God,  how  much  more  so  should  he  say  a  blessing  when  he  is  hungry,  has  food  in  front  of  him  and  is  about  to  eat!”  (Berachot  48b.)   Pinchas  Peli  offers  a  helpful  analysis  of  the  .  significance  of  the  brachot.  They  express   thanksgiving,  he  says,  but  they  go  much  fur  ther.  The  brachah  “is  the  ingenious  rabbinic  way  of  bestowing  significance  on  day-to-day,  moment-to-moment  events  of  life  ...  eating,  drinking,  meeting  a  friend  after  a  long  separa  tion,  receiving  good  or  bad  news,  watching  a  thunderstorm,  seeing  the  ocean  —  these  and  many  other  events  are  transformed  by  the  brachah  that  is  recited  over  them  into  a  reminder  of  who  we  are  and  what  we  are  doing  in  relation  to  God.  The  bachah  pulls  us  out  of  lingering  apathy,  makes  us  feel  alive  every   minute  of  our  life.”   *,  Jeffrey  M  Cohen  says,  “Blessings  are  a   blessing.  Through  the  medium  of  its  brief  bra  chot  formulae,  Judaism  enables  us  to  express  a  momentary  flush  of  spiritual  wonderment  as  a  response  to  all  the  varied  experiences  of  life.”   This  is  the  Jewish  concept  of  holiness  —  as  former  Chief  Rabbi  Joseph  Hertz  says,  “not  so  much  an  abstract  or  a  mystic  idea,  as  a  regula  tive  principle  in  the  eveiyday  lives  of  men  and  women  ...  Holiness  is  attained  not  by  flight  from  the  world,  nor  by  monk-like  renunciation  of  human  relationships  of  family  or  station,  but  S5y  the  spirit  in  which  we  fulfil  the  obligations  of  life  in  its  simplest  and  commonest  details:  in  this  way  is  everyday  life  transfigured.""

"  South  Sydney’s  resurgence  a  Jewish  story   David  Wiseman   JEWS  have  shown  throughout  the  ages  that  they  will  fight  for  what  they  believe,  no  matter  the  cost.   Abraham  was  thrown  into  a  fur  nace  and  survived,  Daniel  went  into  a  lion’s  den  and  emerged  unscathed,  Elijiah  defeated  the  Prophets  of  Baal,   and  David  slew  Goliath.   So  too,  South  Sydney  Rugby  League  Club  took  on  a  goliath  and  won.  At  least  David  has  a  slingshot;  the  people  of  South  Sydney  had  nothing  more  than  what  they  believed  in  and  a  notion  that  if  jus  tice  exists  in  this  world,  somehow,  some  way,  they  would  be  allowed  to  play  rugby  league  for  their  club.   Given  this,  its  should  not  be  sur  prising  that  some  of  the  key  person  nel  behind  South  Sydney’s  battle  and  remarkable  victory  are  Jewish.   Jerry  Lissing  remembers  cheering   on  his  beloved  Rabbitohs  as  a  seven  year-old.  There  is  little  doubt  that  he  and  his  brother  Martin  have  red-and  green  blood  flowing  through  their  veins.  The  brothers  sit  on  the  South  Sydney  board  of  directors  and  were   instrumental  in  South’s  success.   “Sport  means  so  much  to  so  many  people,”  Jerry  Lissing  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.  “The  South  Sydney  Club  means  even  more  to  a  vast  number  of  people  who  have  nothing  else  in  their  lives.   “What  made  it  all  worth  it  wasn’t  the  fact  that  South  Sydney  made  it  back  into  the  competition,  but  see  ing  what  their  reinstatement  meant  to  so  many  people.  Seeing  the  joy  in  their  faces  made  it  all  worthwhile.”   The  Lissings  may  be  better  remembered  due  to  their  associa  tion  with  the  now-defunct  Sydney  City  Soccer  Club,  both  as  players  and  Jerry  as  assistant  coach  in  the  late  1970s.  Even  then,  their  alle  p.  giance  to  the  Rabbitohs  was  unques   tionable,  both  wearing  Souths  socks  under  their  City  socks.   The  step  up  from  supporter  to  the  inner  sanctum  occurred  in  1994,  when  the  Flag  Hotel  Group,  of  which   What  ft  was  all  about  —  sales  manager  Glen  Greenberg  and  production  manager  Brett  Corrlck  with  the  famous  South  Sydney  Jumper.   Jerry  was  general  manager,  became  a  corporate  sponsor  of  the  Bunnies.  Jerry  was  subsequently  invited  onto  the  Marketing  Committee.   In  1998  Jerry  and  Martin  Lissing  formed  Group  14  —  a  collection  of  high-profile  Souths  supporters  such  as  Nick  Greiner,  Andrew  Denton,  Ray   Martin  and  Don  Lane.  It  was  Lane   who  came  up  with  the  name,  saying  that  the  fan  was  a  team’s  14th  player.   In  August  1999  Jerry  and  Martin  were  invited  onto  the  board,  and  have  remained  on  it  ever  since.  Jerry  serves  on  the  Marketing  Committee   and  Martin  on  the  Football  Committee.   Looking  back  on  the  whole  saga,  Jerry  says  “it  was  very  stressful  and  a  hard  fight.  It  meant  a  lot  to  so  many,  and  that’s  why  we  never  gave  up.  But  the  fight  has  only  just  begun.  Now  we  need  the  support  of  the  thousands  of  Souths  fans.  The  fans  must  be  patient  and  appreciate  that  success  may  not  come  overnight.  We   will  be  competitive  and  are  assem  bling  a  team  for  the  future.”   Media  manager  Norm  Lipson,  events  manager  Wayne  Black  and  barrister  Michael  Schieb  are  all  Jewish  as  well.  Lipson  was  the  third  person  to  join  the  team  for  Souths’  reinstatement  after  George  and  Noeline  Piggins.   “You  don’t  campaign  for  some  thing  on  the  basis  of  whether  you  will  win  or  be  successful.  You  com  mit  yourself  because  it  is  what  you  believe  in.  If  you’re  a  person  of  any  character,  you  will  defend  your  prin  ciples.  If  we  had  kept  going  based  on  how  the  outcome  looked,  we  would  have  given  up  long  ago  as  it  looked  hopeless.  But  our  love  for  South  Sydney  never  waned,  and  that’s  the  only  thing  which  kept  us  going.   “Don’t  let  people  tamper  with  your  dreams  and  hopes.  It’s  not  their  right.  If  you  listen  to  them,  you  are  betraying  yourself.”   The  Corrick  family  are  also  lifelong   Jerry  Usslng   South  supporters.  Their  company,  ISC  Sportswear,  will  be  the  apparel  suppliers  of  South  Sydney.  They  have  opened  a  retail  outlet  in  the  Maroubra  Mall,  which  will  stock  everything  in  cardinal  red  and  myr  tle  green  that  one  could  want.  “I  practically  grew  up  at  Redfern  Oval  and  was  always  there,  be  it  games  or  training  sessions”,  production  man  ager  Brett  Corrick  said.   Since  the  1992  Cricket  World  Cup,  ISC  has  been  involved  with  supply  ing  sports  clothing  at  the  top  level.  “It’s  amazing  that  Souths  are  back  in  the  competition,  but  to  think  that  we  are  involved  with  it  is  incredible.  Our  association  with  Souths  was  not  a  business  decision;  it  was  one  made  out  of  love.”   During  the  court  case,  Souths  had  to  establish  that  they  had  sponsors  lined  up  if  admitted  back  to  the  com  petition,  and  ISC  had  to  pledge  their  support  on  the  stand.   The  company  has  also  been   announced  as  the  new  suppliers  of  the  Newcastle  Knights.  It’s  a  case  of  “all  in  the  family”  for  ISC,  with  sales  manager  Glen  Greenberg  the  son-in  law  of  managing  director  David  Corrick.   The  Corricks,  Lissings  and  Norm  Lipson  all  stress  that  the  hard  work  has  only  just  begun.  “We  have  done  the  best  we  could,  and  now  it’s  the  turn  of  the  grassroots  supporters,”  Jerry  Lissing  said.  “The  thousands  of  Jewish  South  supporters  out  there  should  buy  season  tickets,  take  out  membership  and  attend  the  games  next  year  in  their  droves.”   It  is  ironic,  and/or  a  reflection  of  the  sorry  state  of  the  sport  that  South  Sydney’s  biggest  victory  was  off  the  field  and  in  a  courtroom.  Stalwarts  like  the  Corricks,  Lissings  and  Lipsons  will  never  score  a  try  or  make  a  tackle  for  South  Sydney,  but  history  will  record  them  as  being  as  pivotal  to  the  club  as  Clive  Churchill  or  John  Sattler.

"  Berlin’s  new  Jewish  leader  condemns  latent  antisemitism   BERLIN  —  In  his  first  public  remarks  since  being  elected  president  of  Berlin’s  Jewish  community,  Alexan  der  Brenner  has  condemned  the  “latent  antisemitism”  in  Germany  reflected  in  news  reporting  on  Israel.   Anti-Israel  sentiment  in  the  Ger  man  media  “has  awakened  bad  memories,”  Brenner  said.   “Every  Jew  already  hears  in  his  head  the  next  step:  instead  of  ‘Don’t  buy  from  Jews’,  it  is  ‘Don’t  buy  from  Israelis’,”  he  told  the  Berliner  Zeitung  daily,  referring  to  the  1933  Nazi  boy  cotts  of  Jewish  businesses  in  Germany.   “Jews  can  stand  on  their  heads  —  it  won’t  get  rid  of  antisemitism,”  he  said.  “I  see  the  discussion  about   Israel  as  a  vent  for  latent  anti  semitism  in  this  country.”   Brenner,  who  announced  his  can  didacy  late  in  the  campaign,  ousted  incumbent  Andreas  Nachama,  49,  in  Jewish  community  elections  last   week.   Observers  said  Nachama  lost  the  election  because  he  had  not   responded  strongly  enough  to  the   needs  of  ex-Soviet  constituents.   Though  he  won  a  majority  of  the  popular  vote  in  March,  thus  securing  a  place  on  the  community  council,  Nachama  did  not  have  enough  sup  port  to  be  re-elected  to  the  board,  winning  only  eight  of  the  21  votes.   The  member  board,  which  con  sists  entirely  of  Eastern  European  or   Russian  Jews,  voted  decisively  for  Brenner,  who  has  promised  to  devote  himself  to  new  immigrants’  needs.   “I  see  the  discussion  about   Israel  as  a  vent  for  latent   antisemitism  in  this  country.""   Alexander  Brenner,  president,   Berlin  Jewish  community   Brenner,  71,  said  he  will  work  to  help  Jewish  immigrants  from  the  for  mer  Soviet  Union  learn  about  Jewish  tradition,  history  and  religion.   “If  we  want  our  children  or  grand  children  to  stay  Jewish,  we  have  to  introduce  to  them  to  these  impor  tant  values,”  he  said  in  a  radio  inter   view.   The  Berlin  Jewish  community,  Germany’s  largest,  has  increased  from  about  6,000  to  about  12,000  during  the  last  10  years  with  the  arrival  of  new  immigrants  from  the  former  Soviet  Union.   With  the  influx  of  tens  of  thou  sands  of  Jews  from  the  former  Sovi  et  Union,  Germany’s  Jewish  community  has  grown  from  35,000  to  at  least  90,000  in  the  last  decade,  making  it  the  only  growing  Jewish  population  in  Europe  today.

"  Jewish  Brigade  —  an  untold  story  of  heroism  i   Samantha  Baden   WHEN  Eva  Engel  walked  out  of  a  screening  of  In  Our  Own  Hands  —  a  documentary  about  the  Jewish  Brigade  —  at  the  Sydney  Jewish  Film  Festival  two  years  ago,  she  was  filled  with  curiosity.   A  military  unit  of  the  British  Army,  the  Jewish  Brigade  num  bered  5000  Jewish  volunteers  from  Palestine.  It  saw  action  in  Italy  in  1944  and  was  the  only  unit  in  World  War  II  to  fight  under  a  Jewish  flag.,   “I  asked  myself  why  we  don’t  know  about  all  the  wonderful  things  that  the  Jews  have  done  for  themselves,”  said  Ms  Engel,  who  was  born  in  Vienna,  escaped  to  Switzerland  and  immigrated  to  Australia  with  her  parents  in  1939.  “The  film  told  the  story  of  the  Jewish  Brigade,  and  after  seeing  it  I  wanted  to  find  out  if  there  were   A  194Q«ra  poster  urging  the  Jewish  community  In  Palestine  to  Join  the  Jewish  Brigade.   Eva  Engel   Brigaders  in  Australia,  but  also  it  there  were  any  people  involved  in  the  clandestine  network  that  smug   gled  Jews  out  of  Europe  to  Israel.”   She  was  referring  to  the  Bricha  (“escape”  in  Hebrew)  —  the  illegal   immigration  movement  of  Jews  from  Eastern  Europe,  who  crossed  German-occupied  zones  to  get  to  Israel  —  which  worked  with  the  Jewish  Brigade.   Ms  Engel  has  organised  another  screening  of  the  film  for  the  dual  purpose  of  locating  Brigade  and   Bricha  members,  as  well  as  educat  ing  people  about  their  role  after   World  War  II  in  helping  Jews  to  reach  Israel.  The  film  will  be  screened  as  part  of  Shoah  Awareness  Week  at  the  B’nai  B’rith  Centre  on  April  22  at  2.15pm.   Since  seeing  the  film,  Ms  Engel  has  tracked  down  and  interviewed  members  of  the  Jewish  Brigade  and  Bricha  in  the  interests  of  recording  their  stories  for  future  generations.   “There  was  the  woman  who  worked  with  the  United  Nations  Relief  Organisation  who  was  part  of   the  Kindertransport,  but  came  back  to  Europe  after  the  war  to  work  with  refugees  in  Displaced  Persons  camps  with  a  view  to  getting  them  to  Israel.  There  were  a  number  of  people  who  were  involved  in  the  transportation  of  Jews  across  bor  ders  who  were  required  to  know  all  the  routes  and  bribe  the  border  guards’  Then  there  was  the  man   who  knew  everything  and  was  very  high  up.   “People  are  not  aware  of  this  story.

"  Only  eight  Jewish  MPs  in  100  years   Bernard  Freedman   THERE  have  only  been  eight  Jewish  members  of  Federal  Parliament  in  the  100  years  of  Federation,  with  no  sign  yet  of  a  Jewish  prime  minister.   The  community  did  produce  the  nation’s  first  Australian-born  Governor-General,  Sir  Isaac  Isaacs,   however.   From  1940,  Max  Falstein  represented  Sydney’s  now-defunct  eastern  suburbs  electorate  of  Watson  for  nine  years.  Syd  Einfeld,  long-time  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president,  was  Labor  MP  for  Phillip  in  the  eastern  suburbs  from  1961  to  1963.   Sam  Cohen  was  a  Labor  Senator  for  Victoria  from  1962  until  his  death  in  1969.  Dr  Moss  Cass,  Joe  Berinson  and  Barry  Cohen  —  all  elected  to  the  House  of  Representatives  in  1969  —  became  ministers  in  Labor  governments.   On  the  Coalition  side,  Peter  Baume,  a  Liberal  senator  for  16  years,  held  three  portfolios  (Aboriginal  Affairs,  Education  and  Health)  in  the  Fraser  government  between  1980  and  1983.   And  now  we  have  Labor’s  Michael  Danby,  the  first  Jewish  MP  for  Melbourne  Ports  —  one  of  the  original  Federation  seats  —  which  rivals  the  eastern  suburbs  seat  of  Wentworth  as  the  largest  Jewish  electorate  in  the  country.   On  Saturday  he  was  elected  to  a   second  term.   Apart  from  the  MPs,  a  significant   Dr  Moss  Cass   Syd  Elnfeld   number  of  Jewish  senior  public  servants  have  assisted  ministers  and  administered  Federal  Government  policy.   Sam  Landau,  Navy  Department  Secretary  in  the  1960s,  was  one  of  the  first  Jews  to  direct  a  Federal  Government  department.   Barry  Cohen   Peter  Baume   The  tenure  of  Dr  Peter  Wilenski  as  head  of  the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  is  commemorated  in  the  name  of  a  conference  room  in  the  Foreign  Affairs  building.  He  served  as  Secretary  of  the  Immigration  Department  in  the  1970s.   Last  week  Dr  David  Rosalky   retired  as  head  of  the  Department  of  Family  and  Community  Services  (see  separate  story).   His  father-in-law,  Earle  Hoffman,  a  former  president  of  the  Canberra  Jewish  community,  was  assistant  secretary  in  the  Department  of  Primary  Industry  in  the  1970s.   Dr  Ron  Mendelsohn,  the  first  president  of  the  ACT  Jewish  community,  was  among  the  most  influential  bureaucrats.  Assistant  secretary  to  the  Prime  Minister’s  Department,  he  is  credited  with  inspiring  Prime  Minister  Sir  Robert  Menzies  to  embark  on  the  development  of  the  federal  capital  in  the  1950s,  ‘60s  and  ‘70s.   After  the  Jewish  community  acquired  a  prime  five-acre  site  on  which  the  National  Jewish  Memorial  Centre  now  stands,  Sir  Robert  wrote  a  personal  cheque  for  25  pounds  for  the  building  fund.  Dr  Mendelsohn  never  cashed  it,  and  it  is  now  displayed,  framed,  at  the  Centre.   In  1933,  when  Canberra’s  population  was  9000,  the  Census  recorded  four  Jews  living  there,  of  whom  two  were  Governor-General  Sir  Isaac  Isaacs  and  Lady  Isaacs.   The  others  were  Nat  Lipman,  a  compositor  at  the  Government  Printer,  and  his  wife,  Sadie.   In  1947  the  Census  recorded  26  Jews  in  Canberra.  The  1996  Census  figure  of  505  Jews  among  Canberra’s  310,000  population  understates  the  true  position  because  many  do  not  reveal  their  religion  in  the  Census. ",2001-11-16

"  Discrimination  charge  against  Jewish  leaders  thrown  out   Stefan  IBiaBeguski   ACCUSATIONS  of  racial  vilification  against  the  past  and  present  presidents  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  have  been  dismissed  in  the  Federal  Magistrate’s  Court.   After  examining  submissions  from  complainant  Eliana  Miller  and  respondents  Peter  Wertheim  and  Stephen  Rothman,  Federal  Magis  trate  Rolf  Driver  threw  out  the  case.   He  accepted  the  respondents’  argument  for  dismissal,  concluding  that  “the  application  discloses  no  cause  of  action  under  the  Racial  Discrimination  Act  or  the  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunity   Commission  Act”.   Mr  Driver  found  that  Ms  Miller’s  complaint  was  based  on  doctrinal,  rather  than  ethnic,  differences  that  could  not  be  resolved  through  the   Racial  Discrimination  Act.   He  suggested  that  the  Beth  Din  or  Board  of  Deputies  were  the  forums  for  resolving  the  issue.   A  Maroubra  dentist  and  member  of  the  Board  of  Deputies,  Ms  Miller  has  sought  leave  to  appeal.  Her  complaint  was  earlier  thrown  out  by  by  the  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunity  Commission,  which  described  it  as  “misconceived”.   Her  complaint  centred  on  Mr  Wertheim’s  speech  to  the  Board  when  he  handed  over  the  presidency  to  Mr  Rothman  last   Ellana  Miller   Peter  Werthelm   year.  The  Australian  Jewish  News  reported  that  his  speech  urged  the  Board  to  oppose  those  who  would  divide  the  community.  He  referred  to  messianic  groups,  extreme  leftists  and  “a  small  part  of  the  Orthodox  community”.   Mr  Driver  found  that  there  was  no  evidence  that  the  speech  contained  anything  “which,  on  any  reasonable  view,  could  be  regarded  as  offensive,  insulting,  humiliating  or  intimidating  to  another  person  or  group  of  people...   “Mr  Wertheim’s  reported  comments  were  an  apparent  call  for  unity  within  the  Jewish  community  and,  viewed  objectively,  I  see  nothing  objectionable  in  them.   “Ms  Miller  ...  has  drawn  attention  to  what  she  sees  as  important  religious  difference  between   Orthodox  and  non-Orthodox  Jews,  but  I  see  nothing  in  the  reported  comments  by  Mr  Wertheim  which  could  be  construed  as  an  attack  upon  Jewish  belief.”   The  respondents  argued  that  nothing  Mr  Wertheim  said  was  directed  to  “race,  colour,  descent  or  origin”  as  understood  by  the  Racial  Discrimination  Act.   “Mr  Wertheim  was  accused  of  conduct  discriminatory  of  all  Jews,”  Mr  Driver  said,  “but  the  conduct  identified  by  Ms  Miller  concerns  alleged  failure  to  follow  strict  Orthodox  Jewish  teachings.   “These  are  religious  matters,  not  national,  racial  or  ethnic  issues  ...  Ms  Miller  may  disagree  with  what  Mr  Wertheim  was  reported  to  have  said,  but  she  has  not  been  denied  any  benefit  or  subjected  to  any   discernible  detriment.”   Mr  Driver  said  Ms  Miller  also  appeared  to  accuse  Mr  Rothman  of  inciting  an  act  that  would  amount  to  discrimination,  “presumably  the  making  of  the  speech  by  Mr   Wertheim”.   Not  only  was  there  no  evidence  of  such  incitement,  he  said,  but  nothing  had  been  put  before  the  court  to  suggest  that  either  Mr  Rothman  or  Mr  Wertheim  had  done  anything  to  incite  anyone  else.   Mr  Driver  found  that  Mr  Wertheim  and  Mr  Rothman  were  entitled  to  an  order  for  costs. ",2001-11-23
"  A  visit  to  the  Sydney   Jewish  Museum   On  the  8th  May  2001,  Years  6K  and  6M  children  went  to  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum.  As  we  arrived  we  were  faced  with  a  wall  containing  all  the  names  of  Jewish  people  who  perished  fighting  in  a  war.  It  was  sad,  but  the  saddest  was  still  to  come.  We  went  to  watch  a  video  about  anti-Semitism.  The  exact  definition  of  anti-Semitism  is  people  who  are  hostile  or  prejudiced  against  Jews.  The  video  brought  many  tears  to  my  eyes  and  a  shiver  down  my  spine.  I  was  wearing  a  Magen  David  on  my  chain;  I  gripped  it  tightly  and  I  started  to  think  why?  The  Rabbis  clearly  state  treat  others  as  you  want  to  be  treated.  After  all  that  emotion,  we  split  into  groups  and  we  went  on  with  the  tour.  We  went  on  and  saw  some  most  disturbing  pictures.  One  of  the  saddest  was  of  a  little  German  boy  who  was  dressed  in  Nazi  clothing  saluting  Hitler.  We  saw  some  original  clothing,  newspapers,  and  stars  that  the  Jews  wore,  and  we  got  to  meet  survivors.  It  makes  you  wonder  how  through  all  of  the  historical  persecutions  we  survived,  and  with  even  more  faith  that  before.

"  Bibi’s  presence  draws  Jewish,   Arab  protestors   Mark  Sriskin   A  SIGN  outside  the  venue  at  which  former  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Binyamin  Netanyahu  spoke  on  Sunday  was  easily  missed  in  the  commotion.  “Warning:  High  Pressure”,  it  read,  referring  to  a  gas  pipeline—yet  it  could  equally  have  alluded  to  the  tension  between  the  Jewish  and  Arab  protestors.   Yellow  barricades,  a  heavy  police  pres  ence  and  strategically  placed  olive  branches  prevented  150  Jewish  left-wing  and  Palestin  ian  protestors  from  trading  no  more  than  taunts  and  slogans  with  a  much  smaller  but  no  less  vocal  pro-Israel  group.   Anti-Netanyahu  protestors  largely  com  prising  members  of  the  Australian  Jewish  Democratic  Society  and  Women  in  Black,  as  well  as  Friends  of  Palestine,  waved  placards  and  chanted  “Palestine  will  be  Free”,  “Stop  the  violence,  we  want  peace”  and  “Stop  their  government”.  Their  slogans  were  met  with  Israeli  songs,  including  Am  Israel  Chai.   Despite  the  presence  of  50  members  of  the  Australian  Jewish  Democratic  Society,  spokesman  David  Zyngier  said  the  group  had  cancelled  an  official  presence  because  of  security  threats  and  concerns  that  its  pres  ence  might  be  misunderstood  as  showing  support  for  terrorism  and  violence.   Mr  Zyngier  said  Mr  Netanyahu’s  visit  was  an  attempt  to  gamer  support  for  his  policies,  which  would  help  him  become  prime  minis  ter.  “We  will  not  stand  idly  by  and  have  him  assume  the  support  of  the  Jewish  community  in  Melbourne,”  he  said.   Women  in  Black  organiser  Alex  Nissen  said  the  group  was  protesting  against  vio  lence  that  affected  “ail  citizens  in  occupied  Palestine  and  Israel”.   Pro-Israel  organiser  Daniel  Lowinger  objected  to  the  presence  of  Jews  in  the  anti  Netanyahu  protest.  “We  must  show  solidari  ty,  that  Israel  has  a  right  to  retaliate  against  attacks  against  innocent  civilians,”  he  said.

"  News  i!   Jewish  gays  make  a  colourful  statement   ChanialAiM   WEARING  pink-and-white  sequined  gloves,  white  T-shirts  emblazoned  with  a  purple  Star  of  David,  and  some  men  sporting  rainbow  kipot,  Jewish  gays  and  lesbians  made  a  colourful  state  ment  at  the  24th  Sydney  Gay  and  Lesbian  Mardi  Gras  parade  on  Saturday  night.   About  160  participants  danced  a  well-choreo  graphed  horn  routine  behind  a  menomli-decked  float,  called  “The  Stars  of  David  Come  Out  With  Partners,  Friends  and  Family”,  while  Hava  Nagi  la  blared  out.  Organised  by  the  Dayenu  Associa  tion  for  Jewish  Gays  and  Lesbians,  it  was  the  second  Jewish  entry  in  the  Mardi  Gras,  after  last  year’s  initial  appearance  sparked  controversy  within  the  community.   The  previous  evening,  130  people  attended  a  sold-out  Mardi  Gras  Shabbat  dinner  at  Temple  Emanuel.  The  function  was  addressed  by  Aus  tralian  Medical  Association  president  Dr  Kerryn  Phelps,  who  is  both  gay  and  Jewish,  and  Mardi  Gras  board  member  liana  Kaplan.   With  the  theme  being  gay  and  lesbian  par  enting,  family  members  walked  together  —  gay  fathers  with  straight  sons,  straight  mothers  with  lesbian  daughters,  an  elderly  man  carrying  a  placard  that  simply  said  “Grandpa”,  lesbian  mothers  pushing  strollers  —  all  marching  for  the  right  to  be  parents  and  have  families.   Netzer  youth  movement  member  Nadine  Gerber  was  there  to  demonstrate  pride  in  grow  ing  up  with  a  lesbian  mother.  “It’s  important  for  people  to  know  that  as  long  as  there  is  love  in  the  family  and  children  feel  loved,  lifestyle  is  irrelevant.  My  mother  is  normal,  but  her  sexual  ity  happens  to  be  lesbianism.  To  see  someone  live  and  learn  like  my  mother  is  inspiring.”   Marching  to  emphasise  the  importance  of  parental  support,  Ros  Glaser  walked  with  her  two  gay  children,  Neil  and  Benita,  under  the  aus  pices  of  PFLAG  (Parents,  Family  &amp;  Friends  of  Lesbians  and  Gays).  “1  came  to  stand  alongside  my  children  and  let  them  know  how  tremen  dously  proud  I  am  of  them,”  she  said.  “People  must  realise  sexuality  is  a  given  thing,  and  I  look  forward  to  the  time  when  prejudice  against  homosexuality  no  longer  exists.  I’ve  always  taught  my  children  to  stand  up  for  their  beliefs  and  to  be  honest  to  themselves.  I  salute  all  gays  and  lesbians,  especially  people  out  there  who  do  not  have  parental  support.  Closets  are  for  clothes,  not  for  people.”   Added  her  daughter,  Benita:  “It’s  difficult  for  anyone  to  come  out  to  their  parents,  but  it  has  only  strengthened  our  relationship.  They’re  observant  Jews  and  wonderful  parents,  and  ulti  mately  the  best  thing  is  to  live  your  life  openly  and  honestly.”   Commented  Neil:  “Judaism  has  always  been,  and  will  remain,  an  integral  part  of  me.  I  hope  to  be  able  to  make  people  understand  that  it  is  still  possible  to  live  a  fulfilling  Jewish  life  and  be  gay.”   Gay  and  Jewish  father  Rob  Conwell  said  he  was  able  to  attend  his  first  Mardi  Gras  because  his  gay  son,  Justin  Neely,  was  at  his  side.  “This  isn’t  just  a  father  supporting  a  son,  it’s  a  son  sup  porting  a  father.  I’ve  always  promised  myself  I’d  be  here,  and  it’s  fantastic  I  have  my  wonderful   son  to  walk  with  me.”  Added  Justin:  “The  fact   that  both  of  us  are  gay  makes  it  easier  to  talk  about  issues,  and  he  can  offer  me  advice.  This  is  my  father’s  first  parade,  and  we  decided  it  would  be  good  for  us  to  do  it  together.”   By  mutual  request,  the  Jewish  float  was  situ  ated  behind  the  Lebanese  float.  Dayenu  co-con  vener  Judy  Kell:  “We  felt  it  important  for  the  Jewish  and  Lebanese  gay  communities  to  show  how  important  it  is  to  be  unified.  We  wanted  not  only  to  lend  support,  but  to  acknowledge  our  common  issues  and  our  mutual  wish  for  peace.”   A  Jewish  lesbian  carried  a  sign  reading  “Shalom  and  Peace”,  while  a  Lebanese  gay  man  marched  alongside  holding  a  placard  with  its  Arab  translation,  “Salaam  and  Peace”.   Defying  intermittent  rain,  7500  marchers  walked  with  175  floats,  receiving  applause  from  the  500,000-strong  crowd.  “It’s  frightening  when  you  see  thousands  cheering,  but  then  you  realise  they’re  supporting  you,  and  it’s  incredi  bly  exhilarating,”  said  Robyn  Clark.   The  Jewish  group  included  heterosexual  sup  porters  other  than  family  members.  “It’s  impor  tant  to  support  Jews  who  might  feel  isolated  and  have  a  problem  coming  out,”  said  author  Moya  Simons.  “Sexuality  is  private,  but  you  should  never  have  to  deny  your  preferences.  I’ll  contin  ue  to  march,  even  if  it  rains.  Nothing  can  stop   us.”   Large  numbers  of  visitors  made  the  trip  from  abroad  to  be  part  of  the  festivities.  Gay  and  Jew  ish  Londoner  Simmon  Gnessen,  35:  “I  cancelled  travelling  to  Indonesia  to  be  here.  Even  as  a  for  eigner,  it’s  nice  to  feel  that  I  can  feel  welcome  among  Jews  and  to  participate  in  the  parade.”   Participants  from  France,  Canada,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Wales,  Japan  and  Korea  also  marched,  as  well  as  from  across  Australia.   Dayenu  member  Laurence  Luft:  “It’s  more  in  your  face  than  some  would  like,  but  it’s  what  the  community  needs  because  we  were  hidden  for  too  long.  Last  year,  there  was  controversy,  but  it  turned  out  to  be  positive  for  us.  It  finally  became  a  topic  of  discussion,  and  people  who  had  not  given  us  a  thought  either  way  showed  us  how  much  they  support  us.”   Added  Dayenu  co-convener  Malcolm  David  owitz:  “All  of  a  sudden,  we’ve  become  interna  tional.  We’ve  received  calls  from  Jews  against  Neo-Nazis  in  Germany  wishing  us  good  luck.  They  also  wanted  to  know  if  we  had  intentions  of  opening  Dayenu  in  other  countries.  And  gay  rab  bis  from  the  United  States  have  expressed  an  interest  in  joining  us  next  year.  Hopefully  then  we’ll  have  300  marchers.”   RosGlaser  vvfth  her  gjsy  children,  Benttaamf  Nelk.   Participants  In  the  “Stars  of  David  Come  Out”  float.

"  noiocausi  survivor  Josei  Schwartz,  Palestinian  student  Atta  Abu-iVSahmoud  and  Ora  Ratner,  an  Israeli   Courage  to  Care  guide  from  Wollongong.  Photo:  John  Payne   THE  NSW  country  town  of  Bathurst  was  the  location  for  a  spontaneous  Jewish-Palestinian  embrace  last  week,  when  Atta  Abu-Mahmoud,  17,  visited  the  Courage  to  Care  anti-racism   exhibition.   Recently  nominated  for  the  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunities  Human  Rights  Medal,  the  B’nai  B’rith  project  is  showing  in  Bathurst  and  Brisbane  —  the  first  time  it  has  been  exhibited  simultaneously  in  two  centres.   Courage  to  Care  has  been  visited  by  almost  80,000  people  since  its  inception  in  1999.   Atta  and  her  Bathurst  Comprehensive  School  Year  11  colleagues  were  told  by  Holocaust  survivor  Josef  Schwartz  how  Righteous  Gentiles  had  saved  the  lives  of  thousands  of  Jews  during  the  Holocaust.  Atta  said  she  was  unaware  of  the  history,  and  instinctively  embraced  Mr  Schwartz.   The  moment  was  captured  on  camera  by  deputy  principal  John  Payne,  who  obtained  the  permission  of  Atta’s  father,  Mohamed  Abu-Mahmoud,  to  release  the  photograph.   “This  is  precisely  what  we’re  trying  to  achieve,”  said  Courage  to  Care  chairman  Andrew  Havas.  “We  emphasise  the  importance  of  tolerance  and  of  individuals  standing  up  against  evil.  Many  people  are  moved  to  tears,  but  this  is  an  example  of  what  should  be  happening  increasingly.”   Courage  to  Care  pays  tribute  to  men  and   women  who  risked  their  lives  during  the  Nazi  era  to  save  Jews,  and  features  the  stories  of  many  of  those  designated  as  Righteous  Among  the  Nations.   The  Bathurst  exhibition  is  the  eighth.  Courage  to  Care  has  travelled  to  Armidale,  Newcastle,  Taree,  Dubbo,  Sydney,  Perth  and  Brisbane,  as  well  as  to  Victoria.   And  then  they  came  for  me  —  Remembering  the  World  of  Anne  Frank,  a  one-act  play  by  James  Still,  is  touring  with  Courage  to  Care.  Its  message  is  to  revive  the  revulsion  of  forces  which  lead  to  people  being  degraded.   Courage  to  Care  was  opened  in  Brisbane  —  in  flawless  Hebrew  —  by  Queensland  Minister  for  the  Arts  Matt  Foley,  who  spent  part  of  his  youth  on  a  kibbutz.  Mr  Foley  emphasised  the  importance  of  the  exhibition,  especially  in  a  climate  of  international  tension,  and  praised  the  organisers  for  condemning  violence  against  a  Brisbane  mosque.  Schoolgirl  Megan  Shochet  read  an  extract  of  Anne  Frank’s  diary.   About  1300  students  are  visiting  Courage  to  Care  in  Brisbane  every  week.   Mr  Havas  said  the  response  in  Bathurst,  Lithgow,  Orange  and  the  Blue  Mountains  “has  been  phenomenal.  School  principals  have  been  booking  in  entire  grades.  The  entire  Year  9-11  grade  from  Lithgow  High  also  attended.”   Courage  to  Care  has  a  new  website  at  www.couragetocare.com.au ",2001-11-02
"  Purim  parade  replaces  ‘unJewish’  mardi  gras   SYDNEY’S  Gay  and  Lesbian  Mardi  Gras  is  “unJewish  and  inappropri  ate”  because  mardi  gras  originally  marks  the  beginning  of  the  Christ  ian  time  of  Lent,  the  Council  of  Orthodox  Rabbits  has&gt;  declared.   But  Jewish  leaders  have  made  it  clear  they  do  not  want  to  be  seen  as  anti-gay  and  are  therefore  spon  soring  a  Purim  parade  which  will  welcome  participants  from  across  the  ethnic  and  sexual  spectrum.   “We’ve  got  nothing  against  gays,  it's  the  Christian  undertones  of  the  thing  that  concern  us,”  declared  Rabbi  Orange,  spokeman  for  Rabbis  Supporting  Queens,  a  support  group  which  began  to  aid   transvestite  Esthers  at  Purim  but  has  expanded  its  work  to  take  in  other  participants  in  the  fringe  world  of  fancy  dress.   “Dressing  up  Is  an  old  Jewish  tradition  and  drag  queens  are  wel  come  in  any  synagogue  at  Purim.  In  fact,  children  are  taught  from  a  young  age  how  to  dress  as  queens  in  ways  which  are  creative  and  ,  entirely  culturally  acceptable,”  Rabbi  Orange  said.   ‘  “Judaism  is  naturally  tolerant.  I  challenge  you  to  find  another  reli  gion  where  the  clerics  themselves  dress  up  as  Pokemon  or  politi  dans.  You  won’t  find  priests,  min  isters  or  imans  displaying  such  a  modem  attitude  growing  out  of   ancient  traditions.”   that  the  old-Jewish  tradition  of  drunkenness  on  Purim  went  very  Well  with  the  original  mardi  ‘gras  concept.  “Frankly  we’ve  been  onto  tills  for  years.  Getting  drunk,  dress-;  ing  up,  making  a  noise  and  being  queens  (and  kings)  is  what  Purim  is  aU  about.  Combining  it  with  the  mardi  gras  is  natural,  and  in  multi  cultural  Australia  we  would  be   Not  Community  news   expecting  other  religions  to  follow  suit  [or  preferably  spangly  ball  gown].""  .   Rabbi  Orange’s  colleague,  Rabbi  Moshe  Sputnick,  added  that  the  idea  of  a  gay  parade  at  Purim  had  its  foundation  in  ancient  Tal  mudic  sources  which  had  advised   separation  of  the  sexes  and  encouraged  same  sex  friendship  as  a  source  of  purity  and  joy.   “Blatant  heterosexuality  contravenes  the  laws  of  tzniut  [modesty],  where   men  who  concentrate  their   attentions  on  men,  and  women  who  focus  on   wdmen;  gain  a  much  hi|hij   spiritual  level.""   RabMMosheSpiitnscK   “The  very  fact  that  these  people  use  the  word  gay  is  a  confirmation  of  what  we’ve  said  all  along.  Bla  tant  heterosexuality  contravenes  the  laws  oitzniut  [modesty],  where  tions  on  men  and  women  who  focus  on  women,  gain  a  much  high  er  spiritual  level.”   Progressive  Jews,  however,  about  the  proposed  Purim  parade.  “We  prefer  our  Judaism  to  show  a  measure  of  self-control  and  orderli  ness.  Besides  its  hard  to  play  an  organ  on  parade,”  said  Rabbi  Dee  Korum.  “Tradition  dearly  has  its  place  but  going  to  the  Middle  Ages  with  all  this  same-sex  garbage  is  really  not  progressive.” ",2001-03-09

Oppenheimer  dedicated  her  Oscar  to  “the  survivors  of  the  Kindertransport”,  “to  their  parents  who  loved  them  so  much  that  they  had  the  courage  to  send  them  away”  and  “to  die  memory  of  my  mother,  who  was  among  the  10,000  children,  and  to  my  grand  parents,  whom  she  never  saw  again”.   Mark  Jonathan  Harris,  director  and  writer  of  Into  the  Arms  of  Strangers,  spoke  of  sharing  “the  pain  and  triumph  of  the  people  in  our  film.  They  have  enriched  all   our  lives.”   He  previously  directed  The  Long  Way  Home—a  documentary  about  Holocaust  survivors,  which  won  an  Oscar  for  its  producer,  the  Simon  Wiesenthal  Centre.

"  Letters   I  FREQUENTLY  find  myself  having   to  describe  the  situation  in  Israel  to  those  around  me.   It  is  hard  to  explain  the  level  of  complexity,  what  we  are  fighting  for,  whom  are  we  fighting  against  and  what  Israel’s  borders  are,  whether  we  are  talking  about  the  northern  border  (Syria  and  Lebanon)  south  ern  (Egypt),  eastern  (Jordan)  or  western  (the  Mediterranean).   Hasbara  (PR)  is  not  an  easy  job.  First,  the  Palestinians  are  doing  an  excellent  job  themselves,  but  most  ly  because  it  is  hard  to  explain  the  situation.  When  talking  about  Israel,  strangers  often  don’t  have  the  courage  to  say  that  they  don’t   understand  the  situation.   Political  spokespersons  and  peo  ple  on  the  street  (in  Israel  and  here)  often  speak  as  if  there  were  a  war   between  Israel  and  the  Palestinians.   Israel  is  not  at  war  against  the  Palestinians,  but  against  terror  organisations.   Most  of  our  casualties  in  the  last  nine  months  have  been  civilians.  Israeli  civilians  who  are  killed  or  wounded  in  terrorist  acts  do  not  choose  to  be  where  the  bombs  explode;  most  of  the  time,  Israelis  get  killed  on  the  way  to  work  or  while  going  about  their  daily  activi   ties.   On  the  other  hand,  when  Palestinian  civilians  are  killed  or  wounded,  it  is  usually  in  confronta  tion  with  the  Israeli  Defence  Force,  or  while  participating  in  riots  or  ter  rorist  acts.  Parents  who  send  their  children  to  riots,  to  throw  stones  and  Molotov  cocktails  or  to  use  live  ammunition  are  aware  that  their   children  might  not  come  home.   In  such  difficult  times,  the  people  of  Israel  need  the  support  of  their  Jewish  brothers  and  sisters  around  the  world.  We  must  be  united  and   put  aside  all  disagreements,  whether  you  are  left-wing,  right  wing,  secular,  Orthodox  or  Reform.   This  is  a  time  for  togetherness,  not   contention.   This  is  the  moment  of  truth  for  the  Jewish  people.  Our  objectives  will  be  achieved  by  publicly  sup  porting  Israel  and  its  civilians,  visit  ing  Israel  and  sending  messages  of  support  and  solidarity.   In  spite  of  the  above,  to  declare  that  Israel’s  existence  is  in  peril  is  far  from  the  truth.  We  cannot  com  pare  the  current  situation  to  that  which  prevailed  during  the  War  of  Independence.  Israel  is  a  strong  society  with  almost  six  million  Jews.  We  have  a  strong  army,  some  of  the  most  developed  hi-tech  industries  in  the  world  and  excel  lent  education,  health  and  agricul  ture  systems.  These  are  Israel’s  secret  weapons.   Roi  Pilpel   Netzer  Shaliach   Sydney,  NSW ",2001-07-20
"  Jewish  portraits:  A  mirror  to  the  past   Stefan  Bialoguski   WITH  an  enticing  mix  of  charm  and  determination,  German  photographer  Herlinde  Koelbl  pulled  off  a  coup  by  interviewing  and  photographing  80  prominent  Jews  who  had  escaped  Nazism.   She  completed  the  self-financed,  four-year  project  in  1989,  but  only  now  are  the  results  on  show  in  Australia  —  a  joint  effort  of  the  Goethe  Institute  and  the  Sydney  Jewish   Museum.   Simply  titled  Jewish  Portraits,  Koelbl’s  work  has  also  been  published  in  book  form,  her  interviews  giving  the  photographs  an  additional  dimension  in  understanding  such  people  as  former  Austrian  Chancellor  Bruno  Kreisky,  High  Noon  director  Fred  Zimmerman,  Martin  Buber’s  son  Rafael,  philosopher  Sir  Karl  Popper,  conductor  Sir  George  Solti,  Nazi  hunter  Simon  Wiesenthal  and  Edward  Teller,  the  so-called  father  of  the  atom  bomb.   “The  talks  I  had  with  these  people  were  so  intense,  so  rich  and  so  deep  that  I  felt  I  had  received  a  gift  —  even  though  I  was  spending  all  my  money  on  the  project.  I  felt  richer  by  the  end  of  it,”  she  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  at  a  reception  held  in  her  honour  by  Goethe  Institute  director  Dr  Roland  Goll.  “They  were  famous,  but  they  were  so  modest,  their  ego  was  small.”   She  had  approached  institutions  and  companies  for  help  in  financing  these  personalities  who,  having  fled  Hitler,  had   settled  around  the  world.   “It  was  very  confronting,  but  I  was   surprised  that  I  was  well  received  by  most  of  the  people.  They  were  very   open.”   “All  told  me  it  was  important,  but  didn’t  have  the  money  for  it.  I  decided  to  raise  the  money  myself.  I  travelled  twice  a  year,  mainly  to  America,  UK  and  Israel,  for  four  years.   “Working  on  this  changed  my  life.  For  the  first  time  I  met  people  who  could  be  a  role  model  for  me.  They  were  old,  but  they  were  young.  It  was  the  most  important  and  most  intensive  work  I’ve  done.  When  I  finished,  I  got  into  a  deep  hole.  When  you  spend  all  your  energy  on  a  project  and  it’s  finished,  it’s  like  a  loss.”   Friendships  with  several  of  her  subjects  continued,  although  many  of  the  interviewees  —  aged  between  70  and  94  when  Koelbl  met  them  —  have  since  died.  Jewish  Portraits  is  a  testament  to  them,  as  well  as  a  way  for  Koelbl  to  confront  her  homeland’s  past.   “I  did  not  interview  them  about  their  personal  stories;  all  have  tragic  stories,  having  to  flee  and  losing  members  of  their  families.  1  asked  more  ‘essential’  questions,  about  their  Jewish  identity,  about  Heimat,  losing  their   homeland  and  how  it  is  to  be  an  outsider  their   whole  life  ...  Their  spirits  and  thoughts  are  closer  to  the  history  of  Germany  because  young  people  after  the  Holocaust  have  a  different  way  of  thinking.”   Often,  her  interviewees  were  as  surprised  by  her  questions  as  she  was  by  their  responses.  “I  asked  what  they  thought  had  to  happen  for  the  Messiah  to  come.  A  lot  were  surprised  by  that  question  because  it  was  just  a  prophecy  they  had  not  thought  about.  But  a  lot  were  glad  I  was  asking  such  questions  because  they  hadn’t  wanted  to  think  about   them.”   As  a  German,  Koelbl  was  relieved  at  the  way  she  was  received.  “It  was  very  confronting,   Photographer  Herllnde  Koelhl  with  one  of  her  Jewish  portraits.   but  I  was  surprised  that  I  was  well  received  by  most  of  the  people.  They  realised  I  was  an  individual  who  wanted  to  know  more;  it  wasn’t  a  business  interest.  They  were  very   open.   “All  had  had  to  flee  and  had  lost  family  members,  but  they  were  not  full  of  hate.  They  had  reason  to  hate,  but  they  didn’t  hate.  They  were  wise.  One  woman  told  me  she  didn’t  hate  because  that  would  destroy  her.”   Koelbl  also  found  a  variety  of  ways  of  understanding  the  past.  Uri  Avneri  felt  that  the  God  that  allowed  Auschwitz  was  amoral  and  did  not  exist.  Roman  Cycowski  told  her  that  his  sister,  who  had  witnessed  their  younger  brother,  being  led  to  the  gas  chamber,  felt  that  “such  a  thing  can  only  come  from  God”.  Then  there  was  philosopher  Hans  Jonas  who  argued  that  because  God  had  given  humans  freedom  of  choice,  Auschwitz  was  the  work  of  man,  not  of  God.   To  fill  the  hole  left  by  completing  Jewish  portraits,  Koelbl  selected  15  high-profile  people  and  followed  them  for  eight  years,  interviewing  and  photographing  them.  That  became  an  exhibition,  book  and  a  film.  Among  the  subjects  were  German  Chancellor  Gerhard  Schroeder  and  Foreign  Minister  Joshka  Fischer.  “I  just  had  a  good  instinct  to  choose  them.  Public  power  changes  people,  they  pay  a  high  price  for  that  power.  I  like  to  go  deeper  ...  not  just  make  a  nice  portrait  or  get  a  glimpse  of  someone.  1  like  to  get  more  of  their  spirit.”   Koelbl  is  giving  master  classes  at  the  University  of  Sydney’s  College  of  the  Arts  in  Rozelle  until  October  19.  Together  with  Professor  Konrad  Kwiet,  she  will  launch  the  Jewish  Portraits  exhibition  at  the  Goethe   Institute,  Woollahra,  on  October  15  at  7.30pm.  The  exhibition  will  run  for  about  a  month. ",2001-10-12
"  VIEWPOINT   M8CHAEIFREUND   AS  Israel  prepares  to  go  to  the  polls  next  week  for  the  third  time  in  five  years,  the  nation  faces  a  daunting  array  of  difficult  issues.   The  Palestinian  revolt,  Iranian  and  Syrian  threats  to  inflame  the  northern  border  and  a  slowdown  in  the  economy  are  just  a  few  of  the  challenges  awaiting  Israel’s  new  Prime  Minister.   Whatever  one’s  views  are  on  territorial  mat  ters  or  fiscal  policy,  it  is  clear  that  the  most  press  ing  issue  is  something  far  closer  to  home:  restor  ing  the  country’s  sense  of  pride  and  purpose,  both  of  which  have  decayed  in  recent  years.   To  do  this,  Israel  will  need  a  strong  and  impos  ing  leader  —  one  who  will  renew  the  nation’s  confidence  in  the  justness  of  the  Zionist  cause  and  reawaken  its  dormant  sense  of  destiny.  What  Israel  needs  is  a  Jewish  De  Gaulle.   Similar  to  France  in  the  late  1950s,  Israel  is  struggling  to  regain  its  composure  after  a  series  of  painful  national  setbacks.  Forced  to  endure  a   number  of  weak  and  short-lived  governments   presiding  over  a  sharply-divided  electorate,  mid  20th-century  France  as  well  as  21st-century  Israel  illustrate  the  high  cost  that  a  nation  pays  for  political  chaos.   France  in  the  1950s  was  still  reeling  psycho  logically  from  its  1940  collapse  in  World  War  n,   which  had  tarnished  its  deeply-cherished  sense  of  national  greatness  and  military  prowess.  This  feeling  was  exacerbated  when  the  much-vaunted  French  Army  was  unable  to  protect  French  set  tlers  in  Algeria  from  a  rising  wave  of  terror.   Slipping  ominously  to  the  brink  of  chaos,  France  in  1958  turned  to  the  one  general  whom  it  believed  capable  of  putting  the  national  house   in  order:  Charles  de  Gaulle.   Although  a  difficult  personality,  De  Gaulle  was  a  fervent  French  patriot  determined  to  restore  his  nation’s  splendour  and  distinction.  While  many  of  his  policies  would  later  prove  to  be  jus  tifiably  controversial,  no-one  questions  that  his  overriding  concern  was  to  re-invigorate  France’s  sense  of  identity  as  a  basis  for  moving  the  coun  try  forward.   The  values  of  settling  the  land  and  building  the  country  have  given  way  to  the  mall  and  the  internet.  Israel  has  lost  its  way.   And  that  is  exactly  the  type  of  leader  that  Israel  so  desperately  needs  today.  Seven  years  of  the  Oslo  process  have  left  behind  a  shrunken  country  where  Jews  are  murdered  with  impuni  ty  by  terrorists,  shots  are  fired  at  the  nation’s  capital  and  the  government  seems  at  a  loss  as  to  how  to  respond.  After  the  retreat  from  Lebanon  in  the  middle  of  the  night,  the  abandonment  of   French  President  Charles  de  Gaulle  (right)  welcomes  Russian  Prime  Minister  Nikita  Khrushchev  to  France   In  1960.   Joseph’s  Tomb  and  the  inability  to  contain  Palestinian  terror,  Israel’s  once-envied  military  has  seen  its  reputation  badly  tarnished  and  its  deterrent  capability  dangerously  eroded.   The  traditional  Zionist  values  of  settling  the  land  and  building  the  country  have  given  way  to  the  culture  of  the  mall  and  the  internet.  Patriotism  has  been  shoved  aside  in  the  name  of  pacifism;  nationalism  has  been  exchanged  for  nihilism.  In  short,  Israel  has  lost  its  way,  its  pride  badly  shaken  and  its  morale  severely  bruised.   To  emerge  from  its  morass,  Israel  needs  a  leader  who  will  revive  the  nation’s  spirit,  stand  firm  on  principle  and  place  its  national  interests  above  any  other  considerations.  Ariel  Sharon  appears  to  be  ideally  suited  to  the  task.   With  his  long  record  of  devotion  to  the  coun  try’s  defence  and  his  passionate  advocacy  of  Zionism,  Sharon  may  yet  prove  to  be  Israel’s  De  Gaulle,  inspiring  the  nation  to  once  again  believe   in  itself  and  in  its  mission.   Whether  Israel  is  headed  for  an  intensified  conflict  or  a  series  of  longterm  partial  arrange  ments  with  its  Palestinian  neighbours  is  any  body’s  guess.  But  it  will  require  a  man  of  Ariel  Sharon’s  stature  and  experience  to  unite  the  country  behind  the  difficult  decisions  that  may   lie  ahead.   Just  as  De  Gaulle  saved  France  from  Algeria,  Sharon  may  yet  save  Israel  from  Oslo.  For  what  we  need  now  is  someone  to  heal  the  national  consciousness  and  restore  the  country’s  innate  sense  of  Jewish  pride.  What  we  need  is  a  leader  who  will  stand  his  ground,  unite  the  country  and  make  Israel  great  again.  Ariel  Sharon  might  just  prove  to  be  that  man.

"  brrasn  group  reverses  invitation  to  Austrian  Jewish  rightist   Richarol  A66@a  &amp;lt;8r®©Bi@   LONDON  —  An  Orthodox  education  centre  in  Britain  has  withdrawn  its  invitation  to  a  leading  Jewish  mem  ber  of  Austria’s  xenophobic  Free  dom  Party.   The  invitation  to  Peter  Sichrovsky  was  cancelled  after  spon   sors  of  the  Yakar  centre  threatened  to  withdraw  support  for  the  institu  tion,  according  to  Rabbi  Jeremy  Rosen,  Yakar’s  director.   But  Rosen  defended  the  invita  tion.   “There  is  a  difference  between  giv  ing  someone  a  platform  and  engaging  them  in  debate.  We  were  essentially  going  to  grill  Sichrovsky,”  Rosen  said.  “I  have  no  problem  in  sitting  down  with  a  Muslim  extremist  or  Louis  Far   rakhan  if  it  comes  to  that,  and  saying,   How  can  you  say  this  or  do  this?  How  can  you  justify  this?”   Yakar  had  invited  Sichrovsky  to  speak  on  9  September.  The  invita  tion  reportedly  was  extended  after  Yakar  had  invited  the  controversial  Jorg  Haider,  the  Freedom  Party’s  de  facto  leader,  who  was  not  available.   The  Freedom  Party  is  known  for  its  nationalist,  anti-immigrant  rheto  ric,  and  Haider  has  praised  Hitler’s  employment  policies  and  members  of  the  Nazi  SS,  though  he  has  apolo  gised  repeatedly  for  the  remarks.   Sichrovsky  represents  the  party  in  the  European  Parliament  and  is  the  party’s  general  secretary  for   international  relations.   The  chief  rabbi  of  Austria  and  the  head  of  the  Austrian  Jewish  community  reportedly  condemned  the  invitation.

He  told  the  Lon   don  Jewish  Chronicle  that  Sichrovsky  would  portray  the  invitation  as  a  seal  of  approval  from  British  Jewry.   Lord  Janner,  a  vice-president  of  the  World  Jewish  Congress  and  a  Yakar  supporter,  said  the  invitation  to  Sichrovsky  was  not  appropriate.   “It  is  unacceptable  to  provide  a  platform”  to  a  Freedom  Party  mem  ber,  he  said.  “It  gives  them  a  degree  of  respectability,  and  it  outraged  the  Jewish  community  of  Austria.”   Sichrovsky  did  not  respond  to  a  request  for  comment  on  the  inci  dent.  Rosen  said  the  debate  goes  to  the  heart  of  one  of  world  Jewry’s  shortcomings.   The  refusal  to  allow  debate  “is  typ  ical  of  people  who  can’t  argue  their  case.

"  Jewish  leaders  attack   UK’s  Farrakhan  decision   Richard  Allen  Greene   LONDON  —  Lawyers  for  Nation  of  Islam  leader  Louis  Farrakhan  have  succeeded  in  overturning  a  15-year  old  ban  on  his  visiting  Britain.   Jewish  groups  had  been  instru  mental  in  getting  Farrakhan  barred  from  the  United  Kingdom  in  1986  on  the  grounds  that  his  presence  could  stir  up  racial  tension.   Jewish  leaders  reacted  with  dis  may  after  the  High  Court  in  London  struck  down  the  ban  last  week.   “Louis  Farrakhan  has  long  espoused  racist  and  offensive  views.  He  has  never  repudiated  his  obscene  antisemitic  comments,”  said  Neville  Nagler,  director-general  of  the  Board  of  Deputies,  an  umbrella  organisation  that  represents  most  British  Jews.   Lord  Janner,  chairman  of  the  British-based  Holocaust  Education  al  Trust  and  a  vice-president  of  the  World  Jewish  Congress,  described  it  as  “a  sad  day  for  all  of  us  in  Britain  who  work  for  good  race  relations”.   He  said  Farrakhan’s  “nasty  refer  ences  to  Jewish  people  [had]  stirred  up  racial  tension”  in  the  past.   A  spokesman  in  Britain  for  the  Nation  of  Islam,  Minister  Hilary  Muhammad,  said  there  were  “liter  ally  thousands  of  black  and  white  people  in  the  UK  who  would  like  to   hear  what  Louis  Farrakhan  has  to  say  even  though  they  may  not  agree  with  his  teaching”.   The  Nation  of  Islam  —  a  black  nationalist  movement  that  differs  significantly  from  mainstream  Islam  —  is  estimated  to  have  as  many  as  10,000  members,  support  ers  and  sympathisers  in  Britain.   It  organised  a  10,000  Man  March  in  Britain  in  1998,  modelled  on  Far  rakhan’s  1995  Million  Man  March  in  Washington.   Last  November,  then  Home  Sec  retary  Jack  Straw  justified  exclud  ing  Farrakhan  because  he  had  expressed  “antisemitic  and  racially  divisive  views”.   The  Jewish  community  has  long  had  concerns  about  Farrakhan.  In  1984,  he  praised  Hitler  as  “a  very  great  man”.  In  another  speech  that  year  he  said,  “The  nation  of  Israel  will  never  have  any  peace  because  there  can  never  be  any  peace  struc  tured  on  injustice,  thievery,  lying  and  deceit  and  using  the  name  of  God  to  shield  your  dirty  religion.”   The  Nation  of  Islam  argues  that  Farrakhan’s  quotes  have  been  taken  out  of  context  and  points  out  that  in  the  Hitler  speech,  he  added  that  he  was  “not  proud  of  Hitler’s  evil  toward  Jewish  people”.   “A  lot  of  quotations  used  to   Nation  of  Islam  leader  Louis  Farrakhan   exclude  Louis  Farrakhan  are  mis  quotes,  misrepresentations,  or  words  not  said  by  him,”  said  his  British  lawyer,  Sadiq  Khan.   He  argued  that  “Farrakhan  is  not  antisemitic  and  does  not   preach  a  message  of  racial  hatred  and  antagonism”.   But  in  interviews  on  Tuesday,  he  refused  to  say  that  Farrakhan  repu  diated  or  condemned  the  antisemit  ic  quotes  attributed  to  him.   Farrakhan,  who  is  67  and  was  treated  for  cancer  last  year,  will  not  be  allowed  to  enter  Britain  until  the   High  Court  publishes  the  reasoning  behind  its  decision  on  1  October.   The  government  has  until  then   to  decide  whether  to  appeal.   JTA ",2001-08-10
"  Rediscovering  the  sound  of  Jewish  music   VIEWPOINT   I’D  never  celebrated  a  Shabbat   when  six  types  of  tefillah  services  were  taking  place  simultaneously  in  one  building.   I’d  never  sung  Birkat  Hamazon  with  700  people.  I’d  never  sat  in  an  American  basketball  stadium  —  much  less,  heard  1800  people  singing  Jewish  songs  to  the  backing  of  several  rock  bands.  Needless  to  say,  I  had  never  been   to  CAJE.   CAJE  is  the  Conference  for  Alternatives  in  Jewish  Education,  supported  by  its  parent  organisation,  also  CAJE  —  the  Coalition  for  the  Advancement  of  Jewish  Education.  This  year  1800  participants  spent  five  days  learning,  teaching  and  debating  Jewish  topics,  issues  and  priorities.   Most  of  all,  we  celebrated  Jewish  life,  Jewish  culture,  Jewish  heritage  and  Jewish  diversity.   For  an  Australian,  CAJE  is  a  culture  shock.  Hundreds  of  the  women  wore  kippot,  some  of  the  teachers  were  professional  musicians  and  artists;  Chassidic  rebbes  mixed  with  secular  communal  leaders;  clowns  urged  us  to  do  mitzvot  by  bringing  cheer  to  the  world;  an  elegant  “signer”  conveyed  every  message  to  the  deaf  participant;  youth  mixed  with  senior  members  of  the  educational   fraternity.  What  an  experience!   There  were  many  outstanding  scholars.  Nachum  Amsel,  Yosef  Leibowitz  and  Rachel  Korazin  from  Israel,  Rabbi  Mordecai  Twerski,  a  remarkable  Chassidic  teacher,  Harold  Schulweis,  Seymour  Rossel  and  Sunny  Schnitzer,  to  name  a  few.  They  come  from  the  broad  spectrum  of  Jewish  life  in  the  United  States  and  beyond.   What  I  learned  went  far  beyond  the  formal  learning.  It  was  the  sheer  exuberance  of  the  musicians,  singers,  artists  and  storytellers,  who  brought  joy  and  excitement  to  every  moment  —  from  7am  to  2am.   The  conference  was  preceded  by  a  Shabbat  attended  by  700.  I  experienced  Tefillah  in  the  Orthodox  service  I  chose  to  attend,  which  was  beautiful  and  extremely  moving.  Led  by  Sam  Glaser,  a  composer  and  performer  who  combines  religious  commitment  with  the  competitive  world  of  American  entertainment,  participants  blended  a  variety  of  traditions  into  a  sincere  prayer  experience.   In  other  rooms  there  were   equally  powerful  services  for  Reform,  Conservative  and  Reconstructionist  adherents,  a  secular  discussion  group  and  women’s  prayers.  Throughout  the  entire  Shabbat,  Jews  of  all  persuasions  and  commitments  interacted  comfortably,  participating  in  discussions,  meals,  prayers,  singing,  storytelling  and  just  meeting.   This  tone  of  mutual  respect  continued  until  the  closing,  when  a  dozen  scholars  offered  classes  in  Parshat  Hashavua  (the  weekly  Torah  reading),  allowing  participants  to  choose  teachers  from  whom  they  would  like  to  learn.  I  spent  part  of  the  morning  with  an  author  of  children’s  educational  material,  part  with  a  Conservative  chazan  and  the  final  moments  listening  to  the  songs  that  two  women  had  composed  as  their  response  to  the  reading  of   the  text.   The  closing  ceremony  was  unforgettable.  I  sang  with  a  choir  of  300  voices  —  many  professionally  trained  and  unbelievably  powerful  —  under  the  leadership  of  two  of  America’s  best-known  musical  directors  who  devote  a  great  deal  of  their  time  and  talent  to  Jewish  music.   The  entertainment  featured  Sam  Glaser  with  his  original   Sam  Glaser   compositions;  a  children’s  choir,  formed  from  children  of  participants  who  had  their  own  program  running  parallel  to  the  main  conference,  performing  alongside  the  chazans'  choir.  I  could  never  have  imagined  the   magnificence  of  70  chazzanim,  male  and  female,  from  Orthodox  to  Reconstructionist,  joined  in  song.   One  of  my  dreams  has  become  to  see  my  son  participate  in  the  CAJE  teen  program.  It  is  an  opportunity  for  potential  youth  leaders  to  meet,  learn  and  experience  the  joy  and  energy  of  CAJE.  There  is  also  a  college-age  program  for  students  active  in  leadership  and  educational  roles.   Rabbi  Alan  Weiner  from  Pennsylvania,  Chair  of  CAJE,  said  to  the  youth:  “Some  of  you  may  not  enter  the  profession  of  Jewish  education.  You  may  become  doctors  or  lawyers.  But  before  you  make  your  decision,  I  urge  you  to  attend  a  conference  of  lawyers  or  doctors  or  accountants  or  any  other  profession;  see  if  they  have  anything  like  the  atmosphere  you’ve  experienced  here.”   What  they  were  experiencing  was  nothing  more  or  less  than  living  Judaism.  Chassidism  has  shown  us  the  place  of  music  in  spiritual  life.  It  is  time  that  Australian  Jewry  rediscover  the  music  that  can  accompany  Jewish  activity  and  learning,  as  well  as  the  music  that  is  inherent  within  it.

In  addition,  Anthony  Levin  was  appointed  editor  of  the  UNSW  student  newspaper,   Tharunka.   The  result  is  credited  largely  to  an  intensive  campaign  by  the  Australasian  Union  of  Jewish  students  to  encourage   Jewish  candidates  to  stand  for  election  on  university  campuses  throughout  Australia.  The  campaign  saw  AUJS  executive  members  emailing,  letter-writing  and  handing  out  ‘How   to  vote’  cards.   It  marks  the  first  time  that  AUJS  has  run  a  nationwide  campaign,  with  the  number  of  Jewish  students  contesting  positions  increasing  from  an  average  of  five  in  previous  years  to  over  30.   Acknowledging  that  the  campaign  had  had  an  impact,  Mr  Schuck  said  that  having  Mr  Levin  as  editor  of  the  campus  newspaper  would  ensure  balanced  coverage  of  the  Middle  East  and  would  prevent  Holocaust  revisionist  articles  being  published.   AUJS  member  and  recent  South  African  immigrant  Leigh  Burland  —  a  member  of  Interlink,  which  comprises  so-called  “international”  students  —  nominated  too  late  and  was  unable  to  stand.  She  is  likely  to  be  elected  by  the  Student  Council,  however.   The  UNSW  result  was  a  resounding  victory  for  Students’  First,  with  70  per  cent  of  voters  casting  their  ballots  for  the  moderate  party.   At  Melbourne  University,  Real  Students  —  the  equivalent  of  Students’  First  —  claimed  victory,  with  several  Jewish  students  winning  places  in  the  party.  And  at  the  University  of  Western  Australia,  all  Jewish  students  who  ran  were  elected.   “AUJS  has  been  noticed  not  only  at  UNSW,  but  across  the  country,  as  a  force  to  be  reckoned  with,”  Mr  Schuck  said.  “The  bigger  picture  is  that  a  strong  Jewish  presence  in  Students’  First  has  many  positive  implications,  the  most  pertinent  being  the  prevention  of  funds  and  overt  support  for   Palestine  on  campus.  The  entire  Students’  First  executive  is  now  held  by  people  who  would  not  support  anti-Israel  motions.”   With  a  significant  Jewish  presence  at  Macquarie  University,  AUJS  is  encouraging  Jewish  students  to  take  part  in  upcoming  elections  on  that  campus  as  well.  “I  hope  they  turn  out  because,  based  on  last  year’s  results,  there  are  enough  Jews  there  to  influence  the  outcome  of  the  elections,”  Mr  Schuck  said.   A  significant  number  of  Socialist  groups   have  tried  to  distance  themselves  from  anti  Israel  activities  since  the  election,  while  others  have  accused  AUJS  of  making  unfounded  allegations,  he  said.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  national  vice-president  Jeremy  Jones  described  the  results  of  the  UNSW  election  as  “very  positive.  It’s  a  great  way  to  contribute  to  Australian  society  and  the  Jewish  community.” ",2001-10-05
"  Jewish  and  affirmative  in  the  new  South  Africa   Vic  Alhadeff   A  STAR  of  David  covered  with  blood  and  barbed  wire  is  plastered  across  the  poster,  with  the  message  “A   vote  for  the  DA  is  a  vote  for  Israel”.   The  DA  is  the  Democratic  Alliance   —  South  Africa’s  Opposition  party,  which  is  led  by  Tony  Leon  —  and  the  motivation  behind  the  smear  is  an  election  in  Cape  Town.   The  African  National  Congress  (ANC)  —  the  party  which   constitutes  the  South  African   Government  —  denies  respon  sibility,  but  its  printers  produced  the  posters  and  its  candidate  goes   on  to  win  the  election.   Targeting  Mr  Leon’s  identity  also  takes  on  personal  overtones.  As  he  expressed  it  in  an  article  in  The  Spectator.  ......   “The  not-so-coded  identification  of  my  party  and  myself  reached  its  nadir  in  the  provincial  parliament  of  Kwazulu,  Natal.  Dumisani  Makhaye,  one  of  the  ANC  race-baiters,  referred  to  my  Israeli  wife  —  whose  name  is  Michai  —  as  Israel.  In  Nazi   Germany  all  wearers  of  the  yellow  star  were  obliged  to  take  the  name  Israel.   “The  same  gentleman  has  referred  to  my  party  as  neo-fascist,  and  an  ANC  colleague  in  national  parliament  characterised  my  party   as  neo-Nazi.”   Yet  Mr  Leon  is  not  unduly  fazed  by  such  manifestations.  Being  Jewish  in  South  Africa  means  being  part  of  the  debate  and  taking  a  robust  role,  he  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  in  Sydney  last  week.   “I  practise  hand-to-hand  combat  every  day  of  my  political  life.  At  the  mosques  they  say  my  wife  is  a  Mossad  agent.  But  South  Africa  is  a  democracy,  there  is  democratic  space  and  you  must  use  it  appropriately.  If  you’re  under  attack,  fight  back.  Many  Jews  feel  vulnerable;  I  don’t  think  they   should.”   His  Spectator  article  again:  “Israel  bashing  is  more  or  less  compulsory  in  some  quarters.  When  I  raised  the  issue  of  Zimbabwe  —  a  more  immediate  concern  to  South  Africa  than  the  Middle  East  —  in  parliament,  the  ANC’  serried  ranks  screamed:  ‘What  about  Israel’?   “A  good  dose  of  anti-Zionism  goes  quite  a  distance.  This  is  small  beer  compared  with  the  extreme  racism  and  ferocious  violence  that  accompany  many  of  its  occurrences  across  the  world  —  but  it  points  to  the  corrosion  of  the  impeccable  non-racial  credentials  which  were  once  the  calling-card  of  the  African  National  Congress.”   Mr  Leon  visited  a  mixed-race  school  during  the  World  Conference  Against  Racism  —  after  30,000  Muslims  took  part  in  a  pro  Palestinian  march.  A  17-year-old  student  said  his  imam  had  instructed  students  to  participate.   “And  a  letter  on  the  ANC  website  attacking  Israel  was  one  of  the  most  extreme  I’ve  seen.  In  a  decoded  way,  the  ANC  uses  every  opportunity  to  remind  people  of  my  racial  and  religious  background.”   Addressing  a  meeting  organised  by  North  Shore  UIA,  Mr  Leon,  44,  discussed  life  in  post-apartheid  South  Africa,  but  emphasised  that  he  did  not  speak  for  South  African  Jewry.   “Firstly,  while  I  hope  that  all  Jewish  South  Africans  vote  for  my  party,  their  strength  would  return  less  than  one  MP.  So  you  have  to  be  very  ecumenical.  We  have  24  per  cent  of  the  population  behind  us,  including  most  Afri-kaners.  If  Afrikaners  can  cross  the  ideological  Rubicon  and  vote  for  an  English  speaking  Jew,  blacks  aren’t  far  behind;  5-10  per  cent  of  blacks  support  the  Democratic  Alliance.   “Secondly,  the  Jewish  community  has  its  own  representatives  —  and  the  jury  is  out  on  whether  they  are   South  African  Opposition  Leader  Tony  Leon  ...  “I  practise  hand-to-hand  combat  every  day  of  my  political  IHe.”   Photo:  Ingrid  Shakenovsky   doing  a  good  job.   “The  Jewish  community  is  anxious.  Some  believe  a  response  of  silence  and  quiessence  is  good,  others  believe  it  is  preferable  to  fight  back,  and  there  are  some  who’ve  never  met  a  government  they  didn’t  like.”   The  Jewish  future  in  South  Africa  is  tied  up  with  the  country’s  future,  Mr  Leon  said.  “If  there  is  a  future  for  whites,  there  is  a  future  for  Jews.  We  have  to  be  positive  and  robust,  and  stand  up  for  the  things  that   matter.”   While  former  President  Nelson  Mandela  is  a  philosemite  and  “very  disposed  towards  Jews”,  incumbent  Thabo  Mbeki  does  not  have  strong   views  on  the  matter,  he  said.  “When  Arafat  came  to  South  Africa  looking  for  a  statement  of  support,  he  didn’t  get  it.”   There  are  ambivalent  forces  driving  the  country  in  contradictory  directions,  Mr  Leon  said.  “It  wants  to  be  taken  seriously  by  the  winners’  circle  of  countries  at  First  World  level;  yet  it  indulges  in  Third  World  rhetoric.  “South  African  foreign  policy  is  for  sale  to  the  highest  bidder  —  and  the  ANC  receives  a  huge  amount  of  money  from  countries  like  Libya,  Saudi  Arabia  and  Morocco.   South  Africa  has  “an  increasing  black  elite,  a  stagnant  middle  class  and  a  growing  under-class”,  he  said.   “Affirmative  action  —  now  called  transformation  —  has  been  successful  in  terms  of  giving  all  South  Africans  dignity  and  equal  rights;  but  some  services,  like  health  and  education,  have  gone  down.”   However,  a  maturation  process  is  at  work,  with  people  now  voting  for   issues  outside  ethnic  lines.   Mr  Leon  succeeded  legendary  Helen  Suzman  in  the  seat  of   Houghton.  Heading  a  party  with  just  seven  seats  at  the  first  post  apartheid  elections  in  1994,  his  party  today  has  78  seats,  24  per  cent  of  the  vote  and  1400  local  government  representatives.   As  for  aspirations  to  become  President:  “One  never  knows.” ",2001-09-14
"  Proud  to  come  out  —  as  gay  and  Jewish   ChantaiAiM   A  YEAR  after  the  first  Jewish  float  par  ticipated  in  the  Sydney  Gay  and  Lesbian  Mardi  Gras  parade,  the  “Stars  of  David”  are  ready  to  come  out  again  —  and  this  time  they  anticipate  dou   ble  the  turnout.   More  than  300  people  are  expected  to  take  part  in  the  2001  parade,  which  will  take  place  on  Saturday  night,   March  3.   The  Jewish  entry  in  last  year’s  parade  was  160  strong.  The  issue  became  a  centre  of  controversy  in  the  community  when  the  Beth  Din  responded  to  the  Australian  Jewish  News’  coverage  by  requesting  the  edi  tor  to  attend  a  meeting  to  discuss  it.  The  editor  declined  the  invitation,  the  AJN  received  more  than  200  letters  of   support,  and  the  issue  found  its  way  onto  the  front  page  of  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald  and  onto  Geraldine  Doogue’s  Compass  program  on  ABC   TV.   “Last  year’s  march  was  a  proud,  public  moment,”  Dayenu  Association  for  Jewish  Gays  and  Lesbians  cocon  vener  Judy  Kell  said.  “People  are  now  aware  and  more  comfortable  to  talk  about  the  Jewish  gay  and  lesbian  com  munity.”  Apart  from  a  few  negative  responses,  “the  majority  of  the  com  munity  has  been  very  supportive”,   she  added.   Celebrating  both  its  one-year  anniversary  and  the  upcoming  march,  Dayenu  will  hold  a  Shabbat  service  and  Shabbat  dinner  at  Temple  Emanuel,  Woollahra,  on  Friday  evening,  March  2.   The  following  evening,  donning  rainbow-coloured  kipot  and  T-shirts  with  a  Star  of  David  emblazoned  on  the  front,  they  will  take  to  the  streets,  parading  alongside  a  menorah&amp;lt;iecked  float  called  “The  Stars  of  David  Come  Out  Again”.   Ms  Kell:  “It’s  critical  that  this  should  not  be  an  exclusive  gay  and  lesbian   event.  For  us  as  Jews,  we’re  part  of  a  bigger  community,  and  because  our  message  is  about  tolerance  and  inclu  sion,  we’ve  been  actively  working  to  get  members  of  the  broader  Jewish  community  involved.  The  more  peo  ple  know  gays  and  lesbians,  the  more  understanding  they  become.”   A  significant  development  to  emerge  from  last  year’s  march  and  the  endorsement  it  received  from  mem   bers  of  the  community  is  a  noticeable   return  to  Judaism  within  the  Jewish   gay  and  lesbian  community,  Ms  Kell  said.  “Because  we  now  see  that  the  Jewish  community  is  accepting  of  our  lifestyle,  people  who  once  moved  away  from  Judaism  are  now  going  to  shule  and  getting  involved  in  Jewish   activities.  One  man  said  to  me  ‘I  came   out  as  a  gay  man  years  ago—now  I’m  coming  out  as  a  Jew’.”   Dayenu  coconvener  Malcolm  Davidowitz  relates  a  similar  story.  “I  received  a  letter  from  a  gay  Jewish   man  who  was  raised  as  a  Roman   Catholic,  but  always  wondered  about   his  Jewish  roots.  When  he  saw  our  float,  it  rekindled  his  willingness  to  find  out  more  about  his  identity.  This  year  he  will  be  marching  with  us.”   Numerous  heterosexual  supporters  had  shared  a  similar  experience,  Ms  Kell  said.  “Many  were  Holocaust  sur  vivors  who  had  never  been  comfort  able  about  publicly  showing  their  Judaism.  But  when  they  walked  down  Oxford  Street  with  500,000  people  cheering  us,  they  said  they  were  proud  to  be  on  display  as  Jews  sup  porting  gays  and  lesbians  within  our  community.”   This  evolution  has  occurred  after  she  and  other  activists  spent  many  years  trying  to  put  the  issue  onto  the  communal  agenda,  Ms  Kell  said.  In  previous  years,  they  participated  in  the  Mardi  Gras  by  walking  in  small  contingents  with  a  handful  of  col  leagues;  then  in  late  1999,  they  decid  ed  to  place  an  advertisement  in  the   Dayenu  conveners  Malcolm  Davldowttz  and  Judy  Kell.

Following  the  successful  response,  Ms  Kell,  Mr  Davidowitz  and  founding  convener  Dawn  Cohen  helped  to  establish  Dayenu,  which  has  since  doubled  its  membership  to  80  within  a   year.   “It’s  been  a  busy  year,  and  we  now  have  a  core  of  people  who  are  active  in  getting  social  events  happening,”  Ms  Kell  said.  “We  hold  regular  Shabbat  dinners,  and  we’re  setting  up  a  sup  port-and-outreach  program  linked  with  JewishCare  for  parents  coming  to  grips  with  their  children’s  homosexu  ality.”   Last  November,  Dayenu  met  with  Reform  rabbis  to  discuss  issues  facing  the  Jewish  gay  and  lesbian  communi  ty,  such  as  same-sex  commitment  cer   emonies.   “The  rabbis  weren’t  sure  if  Australia  was  ready  for  it,  but  said  they  would  review  the  law  to  see  if  they  could  get  around  it  Halachically,”  Mr  Davidowitz  said.  “But  most  were  quite  happy  accepting  gay  and  lesbians  into  the  community  and  performing  conver  sion  courses  for  people  in  same-sex  relationships.”   Dayenu  is  also  involved  in  organis  ing  a  conference  entitled  “The  Religious  Roots  of  Homophobia”,  to  be  held  in  Sydney  on  February  25-26.  The  speakers  will  include  Jewish  comedian  Jackie  Loeb,  David  Marr,  Dorothy  McRae-McMahon  and  David   Bromell.   “Along  with  2000  years  of  anti  semitism,  many  recognise  that  the  Judaeo-Christian  belief  system  has  also  discriminated  against  gays  and  lesbians,”  Ms  Kell  said.  “We  have  a  right  to  be  recognised  and  included,  and  we  should  not  hide  either  part  of  our  identity  —  neither  our  Jewish  nor  our  gay  and  lesbian  identity.”   i  Jewish  themes  in  EVUanfi   Gras  Film  Festival,  page  25   Dr  llan  Buchman ",2001-02-16
"  US  ambassador  sought  comfort  at  Canberra’s  Jewish  Centre   Bernard  FMman   NEW  Yorker  Gary  Fellman  was  con  ducting  his  fortnightly  adult  educa  tion  class  on  Judaism  at  Canberra’s   National  Jewish  Centre  last  Sunday  week,  when  an  unexpected  guest   arrived.   American  Ambassador  Tom  Schi  effer,  just  back  from  Washington  where  he  had  witnessed  the  terrorist  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Centre  and  the  Pentagon,  had  come  to  the  centre  with  his  wife  and  son.   As  he  later  told  a  service  of  com  memoration  and  thanksgiving  attended  by  more  than  2,000  people  at  Parliament  House,  Mr  Schieffer  went  to  the  Jewish  Centre  to  seek  comfort  from  a  “higher  being”  in  the  aftermath  of  the  attacks  in  America,  which  claimed  more  than  6,000  lives.   At  the  centre,  Mr  Schieffer  was  served  a  bagel  and  lox  and  apple  and  honey  to  mark  Rosh  Hashanah.  He  described  his  experience  in  Washing  ton  where  he  was  present  during  the  visit  of  Prime  Minister  John  Howard,  telling  the  group  he  had  called  on  Mr  Howard  who  had  been  moved  to  secure  quarters  in  the  Australian  Embassy  after  the  hijacked  aircraft  smashed  into  the  Pentagon.   The  ambassador,  who  spent  about  45  minutes  at  the  centre,  also  visited  the  cheder  which  was  in  progress.   At  the  interdenominational  service   US  Ambassador  Tom  Schleffer,  his  wife  Suzanne,  and  Drs  Alan  and  Anita  Shroot  at  the  Canberra  Jewish  Centre  several  days  after  the  terrorist  bombings  in  America.   at  Parliament  House  attended  by  Gov  ernor-General  Peter  Hollingworth,  the  prime  minister,  Opposition  leader  Kim  Beazley,  parliamentarians,  diplo   “No  Christian,  no  Jew,  no  Muslim  would  have   done  such  a  thing.”   Tom  Schieffer,  US  ambassador   mats  and  members  of  the  public,  Mr  Shieffer  talked  of  why  he  had  visited  the  Jewish  Centre,  attended  a  Catholic  mass,  an  Anglican  service   and  visited  with  the  imam  of  the  Can  berra  mosque  last  Sunday.   “I  am  a  Presbyterian  by  faith,”  he  said.  “But  I  felt  as  the  American  ambassador  it  was  important  to  remember  that  God  is  worshipped  in  many  places  and  in  many  ways.   “In  each  place  I  felt  the  presence  of  God.  In  each  place  I  looked  into  the  faces  of  men  and  women  who  shared  our  pain  ...  at  the  monstrous  acts  that  have  been  committed.   “It  is  important  for  all  of  us  to  remember  that,  just  as  Hitler  was  no  Christian,  those  who  committed  these  horrible  acts  were  not  men  and  women  of  faith.  No  Christian,  no  Jew,  no  Muslim  would  have  done  such  a  thing.” ",2001-09-28
"  Global  shtetl   51  per  cent  weren’t  Jewish   ISRAELI  Interior  Minister  Eli  Yishai  hopes  to  close  loopholes  that  are  allowing  an  ever-increasing  num  ber  of  non-Jews  to  immigrate  into  the  country.  According  to  figures  compiled  by  the  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics,  51  per  cent  of  new  immigrants  last  year  were  not  Jewish,  compared  with  4  per  cent  in  1990.  Speaking  to  the  Knesset  Committee  on  Absorption  and  Immigration,  Yishai  said  he  intends  to  garner  political  support  to  change  the  Law  of  Return,  which  allows  the  child  or  grandchild  of  a  single  Jewish  par  ent  to  immigrate,  even  if  they  are  not  considered  halachically  Jewish.  Yishai  said  he  fears  Jews  will  become  a  minority  in  their  own  country  if  an  effort  is  not  made  to  solve  the  problem.  The  people  in  ques  tion  are  mostly  immigrants  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  who  do  not  plan  to  settle  here,  he  said,  but  use  absorption  funds  and  then  leave. ",2001-12-21
"  Arabs  declare  war  on  Pokemon  as  a  Jewish  conspiracy   LOS  ANGELES  —  An  Arab  campaign  against  the  Pokemon  children’s  game  —  for  its  allegedly  Jewish  connotations  —  is  picking  up  steam   across  the  Middle  East.   Anti-Pokemon  campaigns  are  under   way  in  Saudi  Arabia,  Jordan,  Egypt,  Oman,  Qatar  and  Dubai,  according  to  the  Los  Angeles  Times.   Pokemon,  which  includes  video  games,  trading  cards  and  cartoons   with  images  of  monsters,  has   belatedly  made  its  way  to  the  Arab   world.  Muslim  officials  claim  the  word  “Pokemon”  means  “I  am  a  Jew”  in  Japanese,  and  believe  the  toy  craze  is  part  of  a  Jewish-Zionist  conspiracy  to   turn  Arab  children  away  from  Islam.   Despite  assurances  from  the  Japan  based  Nintendo  company,  which  launched  Pokemon  in  1995,  that  the  name  is  an  abbreviation  of  “pocket  monster”,  video  games  and  related  items  have  been  stripped  from  store  shelves  in  Saudi  Arabia  and  turned  away  at  ports.  Schools  have  set  up  collection  points  to  turn  in  clothing  decorated  with  Pokemon  figures.   A  fatwa,  or  religious  edict,  issued  by  a  Saudi  sheikh  urges  Muslims  to  beware  of  the  game,  noting  that  cards  bear  “six-pointed  stars  —  a  symbol  of  international  Zionism  and  the  State  of  Israel”.  A  fatwa  in  Dubai  warns  that   Pokemon  “is  based  on  the  Theory  of  Evolution,  a  Jewish-Darwinist  theory  that  conflicts  with  the  truth  about  humans  and  with  Islamic  principles”.   Partly  underlying  the  campaign  may  be  the  same  frustrations  felt  by  American  parents  whose  children  played  with  the  products  obsessively.   “Our  children  have  found  in  Pokemon  an  opportunity  to  lose  themselves  in  it,”  complained  an  article  headlined  “Pokemon  Virus”,  published  in  the   United  Arab  Emirates.   The  original  Pokemon  contained  150  characters,  each  a  mini-monster  with  the  potential  to  transform  into  a  powerful  creature.  By  1999,  when  the   game’s  popularity  peaked  in  the  US,  it  had  evolved  into  a  multi-media   phenomenon  with  movies,  television  shows,  clothing  and  toy  lines  —  and  sales  in  the  billions  of  dollars.   The  anti-Jewish  overtones  of  the  campaign  have  raised  concerns  among  American  Jewish  leaders.  Anti-  Defamation  League  national  director  Abraham  Foxman  warned  that  “when  you  start  saying  the  Jews  are  manipulating  children’s  minds,  that  is  scary.  And  when  it  comes  wrapped  in  falwas,  as  God’s  truth,  it  becomes  a  lot   scarier.”   In  1999,  the  ADL  complained  that  a  Pokemon  card  bore  an  image  similar  to  a  swastika;  Nintendo  discontinued  the  offending  card.

"  Jewish  knowledge:  Israel’s  internal  security  problem   PARTISAN   Sam  UpsSd   IN  the  early  years  after   Israel's  establishment  a  statement  attributed  to  David  Ben-Gurion  gained  wide  currency.  Apocryphal  or  not,  Ben-Gurion’s  statement  was:  “More  than  what  the  nations   say,  it  matters  what  the  Jews  do.”  In  another  version,  Ben  Gurion’s  maxim  was  reportedly  more  dogmatic:  “It  doesn’t  mat  ter  what  the  nations  say:  it  mat  ters  only  what  the  Jews  do.”   Somehow,  whatever  Ben-Guri  on  really  did  say,  we  know  that  in  practice  he  was  smart  enough  a  national  leader  to  have  espoused  the  former,  not  the  latter  version.  Then  or  now,  regardless  of  Israel’s  considerable  economic  and  military  strength,  the  Jewish  State  has  never  been  able  to  ignore  international  pressures,  especially  those  emanating  from  its  strong  and  powerful  ally,  the   United  States.   Today,  however,  there  is  something  different  about  the  balance  of  forces  with  which  Israel  has  to  contend.  In  the  twi   light  zone  war  that  Israel  is  fight  ing  against  the  Palestinians,  the  key  to  Israel’s  ability  to  tough  it  out  over  the  long  haul  is  very  much  in  the  hands  of  the  Israelis  themselves.  It  is  largely  a  matter  of  inner  spiritual  strength  and   national  morale.   Yes,  international  pressure  will  continue  to  matter.  But,  for  the  most  part,  whether  Israel  emerges  over  the  next  few  years  as  res  olute  enough,  and  yet  flexible  enough,  to  conclude  a  just  settle  ment  with  the  Palestinians,  really  does  depend  more  on  what  the  Jews  do,  than  on  what  the  nations   say.   Well,  not  quite.  Today  we  need  to  adapt  Ben-Gurion’s  dictum.  For  the  war  of  attrition  between  Israel  and  the  Palestinians  is  very  much  about  “hearts  and  minds”,  even  more  than  it  is  about  Kalashnikovs  and  air-to-ground  missiles.  Today’s  Ben-Gurion  ism  should  therefore  be:  “More  than  what  the  Palestinians  do  with  their  terror,  more  than  what  the  nations  of  the  world  say  in  their  media,  it  matters  what  the  Jews  say  to  themselves  in  the  land  of  the  Jews.”   That  introduction  leads  me  to  what  has  the  potential  to  be  one  of  the  most  fateful  “securi   ty”  decisions  the  Sharon  Gov   ernment  has  taken  since  its  election  in  February.  And  that  is  the  announcement  this  week  by  Education  Minister  Limor  Liv  nat  that,  come  September,  and  as  a  first  step,  the  country’s  secular  middle  schools  (Years  9  and  10),  will  teach  more  Zionist  history  and  Jewish  heritage,  including  the  weekly  Torah  por  tion  and  the  meaning  of  a  bar   mitzvah.   Jewish  heritage  in  Israeli  schools?  It  may  seem  odd  to  Dias  pora  Jews  who  haven’t  followed  the  deracination  of  Israel’s  secu  lar  educational  system.  But  that’s  post-Zionism  for  you.   So  it’s  Livnat’s  rationale  for  this  initiative  which  is  worth   examining  and  applauding.  Sur  veys,  she  noted,  had  shown  pupils  knew  too  little  about  the  nationalist  basis  for  “our  exis  tence  here  as  a  country  and  a  people”.  According  to  the  Jerusalem  Post  she  continued:  “I  regard  the  education  system  as  the  internal  security  [emphasis  mine]  of  the  State  of  Israel.  We  cannot  exist  here  as  a  people  and  a  country  if  the  pupils  don’t   learn  about  their  heritage,  and  about  Jewish,  nationalist,  human  ist  and  global  values.”   Livnat  is  on  to  something  basic  here.  Achieving  a  peace  deal  still  must  be  any  Israeli  gov  ernment’s  priority.  But  if  the  Palestinians  are  just  not  ready  for  it,  and  the  evidence  mounts  daily  that  they  and  the  present  Arafat  leadership  aren’t,  then  any  Israeli  government,  and  therefore  Israeli  society,  must  be  prepared  for  the  long  haul.  Even   if  Israel  decided  tomorrow  to  withdraw  unilaterally  from  the  remaining  occupied  territories,  it’s  doubtful  if  such  a  move  would  lead  to  an  immediate  cease-fire.  Instead,  Lebanon  style,  it  would  probably  embold  en  the  more  militant  Palestinians  to  keep  attacking  Israel.   It  follows,  then,  that  to  main  tain  security  for  their  fellow  citi  zens,  young  Israeli  soldiers  must  be  prepared  to  continue  to  fight  and,  tragically,  to  die.  That  is  also  a  burden  which  their  families  and  the  nation  as  a  whole  must  be  pre  pared  to  bear.  But  why  would  they  if  many  of  their  teachers  at  school  and  university,  the  media  commentators,  and  influential  writers  and  poets,  question  the  very  basis  of  Israel’s  past  and  present?   ""The  post-Zionist   ascendancy  in  Israel’s  culture  wars  presents  a  clear  and  present  danger  to  Israel’s  very  survival.""   Fortunately,  the  post-Zionists  haven’t  had  it  all  their  own  way.  The  significant  weakening  of  the  earlier  generation’s  Zionist  com  mitment  has  worried  many  con  cerned  Israelis,  regardless  of  politics.  Indeed,  Zionism’s  strength  historically  has  always  been  that  you  could  be  a  hyphen  ated  Zionist  (right-Zionist,  left  Zionist,  religious  Zionist  or  secular  Zionist).   The  eclipse,  if  not  the  com  plete  defeat,  of  Zionism  would  have  been  deeply  regrettable  and  depressing  if,  somehow,  as  so  many  of  us  had  hoped,  peace  had   broken  out  in  our  time.   But  it  hasn’t.  Rather  it’s  a  time  when  the  fastest  selling  hit  amongst  Palestinians  and  the  Arabs  is  “I  hate  Israel”,  when  Syria’s  President  Assad  stands  alongside  a  silent  Pope  in  Damas  cus  and  vilifies  the  Jews,  and  when  the  Palestinian  media,  schools  and  the  mosques  in  Gaza  and  on  the  West  Bank  chum  out  a  daily  litany  of  hate.   At  such  a  time  the  post-Zionist  ascendancy  in  Israel’s  culture  wars  presents  a  clear  and  present  danger  to  Israel’s  very  survival.  Which  is  precisely  why  their  schools  must  provide  young  Israelis  with  something  more  than  Internet  skills.  That  Education  Minister  Livnat  is  willing  to  start  somewhere  is  at  least  a  sign  of  hope.   f!  Sam  Lipski  is  a  former  editor  of   the  AJN. ",2001-05-18
"  RABBI  JOHN  LEVI   IT  would  be  difficult  to  imagine  a  more  ominous  beginning  to  a  new  century.  The  storm  clouds  of  war  have  returned  to  darken  the  horizons  of  the  Middle  East  and  Israel  is  braced  to  struggle  against  a  brutal  and  implacable  alliance  of  enemies.  How  dare  anyone  look  to  the  future  with  hope?   Paradoxically,  the  20th  century  began  with  hope  and  would  be  stained  with  bestial  outbreaks  of  genocide  and  total  war.  One  hundred  years  ago,  no  sane  person  could  have  guessed  that  millions  would  be  gassed  and  shot  and  bombed  in  two  World  Wars  and  a  host  of  “minor”  skir  mishes.  Industrialisation  had  brought  such  economic  blessing  to  Europe  and  to  North  America.  Australia,  with  its  gold  and  wheat  and  wool,  had   become  one  of  the  wealthiest  soci  eties  in  the  world.  The  newly-federat  ed  Commonwealth  belonged  to  the  world’s  greatest  Empire  and  believed  it  would  never  be  abandoned.  We  built  high  walls  to  protect  both  our  industries  and  the  racial  purity  of  our  people.   One  hundred  years  later,  that  world  has  turned  upside-down.  Global  pol  lution  and  global  warming  touch  our  lives  wherever  we  live.  Distance  now  means  very  little,  and  no-one  can  remain  isolated  from  change.   Satellites,  instantaneous  means  of  communication  and  whatever  will  replace  the  internet  will  enable  the  Diaspora  —  a  worldwide  community  —to  flourish.  In  a  very  real  sense,  the  Diaspora  is  a  paradigm  for  the  future.   It  does  not  take  a  genius  to  work  out  that  the  power  of  the  oil-exporting  nations  will  soon  decline  or  disappear  as  petrol-driven  engines  give  way  to  hydrocarbons  and  solar  power.  The  age  of  fossil  fuel  for  energy  may  have  another  decade  to  go,  but  within  a  generation,  the  society  which  is  the  most  advanced  technologically  will  be  the  most  secure  and  prosperous.   Awful  possibilities  haunt  us.  We  have  come  to  accept  as  normal  the  weapons  search  that  must  be  carried  in  every  airport.  All  pieces  of  luggage  must  now  be  checked.  Religious  fun   damentalists  explode  bombs  beside  churches  in  Jakarta.  Iran  supplies  Hezbollah  with  bombs  to  hit  Israel’s  northern  borders.  No-one  should  imagine  that  Iran  has  changed  its  global  aims  or  that  Syria’s  new  President  will  suddenly  seek  peace.   And  so,  for  the  sake  of  the  onset  of  this  new  century  (according  to  the  civil  calendar),  let  us  take  a  deep  breath  and  ask  what  this  forbidding  scenario  can  hold  for  us  as  Jews  and  as  Australians.  To  accomplish  this  exercise,  I  will  make  the  gigantic  assumption  that  my  worst  fears  will  not  be  realised  and  that  peace  will  come  to  the  Middle  East  and  Israel  will  continue  to  flourish.   “Flourish?”  I  hear  you  ask!  How  can  you  write  about  a  flourishing  Israel  with  Islamic  Jihad  and  Hamas  on  the  rampage?  The  answer  is  provided  by  recalling  the  Israel  of  1948  or  1967  or   1977.   I  studied  on  a  kibbutz  in  1955.  We  were  allowed  one  meat  sausage  a  week  and  two  eggs  every  ten  days.  Infrastructure  barely  existed.  For  its  first  ten  years,  Israel’s  tiny  population  bore  the  scars  of  either  the  Shoah  or  the  experience  of  living  in  the  lands  of  Islam.  We  know  that  Israel  will  not  commit  suicide  and  we  understand   that  no-one  wishes  to  turn  Jerusalem  into  a  new  version  of  Belfast  or  Danzig.  So  what  lies  ahead  for  us?   For  the  Jewish  community  of   the  world,  the  smile  of  the  Cheshire  Cat  is  a  poignant  image  because  we  are  part   of  a  wider  community   whose  faith  is  vanishing.   Only  vestiges  remain.   It  has  been  said  this  is  the  Age  of  Triage.  As  the  casualties  increase  and  the  population  of  the  world  reaches  dizzying  heights,  the  value  of  human  life  becomes  relative.  A  massacre  in  Rwanda  and  a  flood  in  Bangladesh  hardly  impinges  upon  our  lives,  and  we  protectively  teach  ourselves  to  grow  an  outer  skin  of  callous  indiffer  ence.  It  is  as  though  the  Shoah  has  become  the  universal  symbol  for  the  new  century.  What  is  the  most  effec  tive  form  of  defence?  A  worldwide  process  of  disarmament  would  release  billions  for  education,  health  and  welfare.  We  are  reaching  for  the   stars,  and  simultaneously  will  be  forced  to  cope  with  the  ethical  chal  lenges  posed  by  the  mapping  of  the  genome  code.   In  the  21st  century,  Australia  obvi  ously  needs  to  take  education  much  more  seriously.  Education  and  tech  nology  is  our  decisive  strength,  just  as  it  is  in  Israel.  The  world’s  focus  will  inevitably  shift  to  the  emerging  economies  of  the  Asia-Pacific  region.  The  huge  populations  of  India  and  China  will  have  an  enormous  impact  on  Australia.  We  can  see  this  already  in  the  faces  of  our  young  people  in  the  streets  of  Sydney  and  Melbourne  (but  not,  as  yet,  in  rural  Australia).  We  may  become  a  republic  just  in  time  to  see  the  nation-state  disappear.   Judaism  and  the  Jewish  people  will  continue  to  change.  Change  is  almost  the  only  constant  in  Jewish  history.  (The  true  core  value  of  Judaism  is  the  unity  concept  expressed  in  the  ShemcL)  The  religious  empowerment  of  Jewish  women  has  already  begun  to  transform  our  community.  Given  another  10-20  years,  the  impact  of  the  immigration  of  one  million  former  Soviet  citizens  to  Israel  will  have  a  profound  impact  on  World  Jewry.  Twenty  percent  of  the  Jewish  com  munity  in  Melbourne  is  composed  of   new  settlers  from  Russia.  That  is  the  recipe  for  a  powerful  communal   change.   Language  shapes  patterns  of  behaviour  find  thought.  Fifty  years  ago,  who  would  have  dreamed  that  there  would  be  one  million  Moslem  Arabs,  citizens  of  Israel,  who  would  speak  Hebrew?  Or  that  four-fifths  of  the  Jews  in  the  Diaspora  would  speak  English?  In  fact,  as  Aramaic  once  was  to  Hebrew,  so  English  —  the  interna  tional  language—is  to  Hebrew  today.  So  too  is  the  continual  process  of  acculturation  and  assimilation  throughout  the  Diaspora.  We  can  either  curse  both  or  creatively  adapt  to  both,  but  we  cannot  deny  reality.   Do  you  remember  the  story  of  Alice  in  Wonderland  who  kept  meeting  the  Cheshire  Cat,  which  gradually  disap  peared  until  only  his  smile  remained?  For  the  Jewish  community  of  the  world,  the  smile  of  the  Cheshire  Cat  is  a  particularly  poignant  image  because  we  are  part  of  a  wider  non  Jewish  community  and  civilisation  whose  faith  is  vanishing.  Only  ves  tiges  remain.  The  chocolate  eggs  at  Easter  and  the  ubiquitous  festive  jin  gles  in  summer  are  disturbing  omens  of  a  future  that  lacks  any  sense  of  meaning,  awe  and  holiness.   We  can  all  identify  Jewish  parallels  to  the  smile  of  that  Cheshire  cat.  My  unfavourite  “Jewish”  experience  is  the  single-sex  dancing  at  simchot  to  the  words  of  Adon  Olam,  or  Oseh  Shalom  belted  out  by  a  half-naked  nightclub  torch  singer.   Despite  the  best  efforts  of  our  reli  gious  fundamentalists  on  the  one  hand  and  the  hedonistic  secularists  on  the  other,  Judaism  is  a  religious  civilisation  that  strives  to  make  sense  of  life.  Judaism  contains  a  multi-lay  ered  message  that  light  (or)  is  con  tained  in  Torah.  When  we  kindle  the  Shabbat  lights,  we  affirm  this  reality.  When  we  write  or  read  Jewish  books  (or  newspapers!),  we  acknowledge  that  learning  is  the  Jewish  way.  We  search  for  meaning.  We  ask  ques  tions.  We  celebrate  freedom  as  a  basic  religious  value.  We  value  our  sense  of  family  and  community.  We  accept  diversity.  Judaism  is  colour-blind.  The  future  will  need  all  these  values.  They  didn’t  come  about  by  accident,  and  it  is  our  task  to  nurture  them  in  the  21st  century.   10  Rabbi  John  Levi  is  Rabbi  Emeritus  of  Temple  Beth  Israel,  Melbourne.

"  Mein  Kampf  royalties  paid  bills  for  Jewish  charily   Richard  Allen  ©seen®   LONDON  —  A  controversy  has  erupted  after  reports  that  a  British  charity  set  up  to  aid  German  Jewish  refugees  accepted  royalties  from  the  sale  of  Hitler’s  Mein  Kampf—  even  though  the  group  no  longer  accepts  the  royalties.   The  public  announcement  that  the  German  Welfare  Council  no  longer  accepts  the  funds  followed  a  report  last  week  in  Britain’s  Sunday  Telegraph  newspaper  claiming  the  charity  had  received  more  than  US$675,000  (A$  1,306,117)  from   Hitler’s  work.   The  council  disputed  the  Tele  graph’s  numbers,  saying  it  had  received  an  average  of  US$5,400  (A$10,449)  a  year  from  the  royalties  for  the  last  quarter-century.   The  charity  said  it  used  some  of  the  funds  to  meet  shortfalls  in  its  budget,  and  invested  the  rest.  It  decided  to  stop  taking  the  money  last  year  due  to  the  decreasing  number  of  Jewish  refugees  requiring  the  charity’s  service,  it  said.   The  remainder  of  the  Mein  Kampf   money  —  which  the  council  esti  mates  to  be  US$50,000  (A$96,000)  —  has  been  kept  separate  from  other  council  funds,  pending  a  decision  about  what  to  do  with  the  money.   Lord  Janner,  chairman  of  the  British-based  Holocaust  Educational  Trust,  condemned  any  charity’s  decision  to  accept  funds  from  Hitler’s  opus.   “1  would  be  surprised  if  any  char  ity  would  knowingly  wish  to  benefit  from  Hitler’s  royalties,”  he  told  JTA,  describing  Mein  Kampf  as  an  “evil  work”  and  “political  pornography  of  the  worst  kind”.   A  combination  autobiography  and  political  manifesto,  Mein  Kampf  was  banned  in  Britain  from  1944  until  1969.  But  it  has  been  available  in  English  for  more  than  30  years,  despite  protests  from  Jews  and  the  West  German  Gov  ernment.   When  royalties  from  the  sales  of  the  book  began  arriving  at  the  offices  of  the  literary  agency  Curtis  Brown,  the  agency  asked  the  West  German  Embassy  in  London  what  to  do  with  the  money.   The  government  of  the  German   state  of  Bavana  owns  the  foreign  publishing  rights  to  the  tract,  but  the  embassy  told  Curtis  Brown  that  the  German  Welfare  Council  would  be  an  appropriate  recipient  of  the  funds.   The  council  was  founded  in  1952  to  aid  German  Jewish  refugees  in  Britain,  and  is  largely  funded  by  the  German  Foreign  Office.   “As  the  publishing  house   did  not  refrain  from   commercial  publishing  in   the  UK,  the  view  was  taken  that  the  royalties  should  at   least  benefit  the  victims   of  Nazi  persecution.""   Statement  Issued  by  the  German  Welfare  Council   “The  council  opposes  the  com  mercial  publication  of  Mein  Kampf.  However,  as  the  publishing  house  did  not  refrain  from  commercial  publishing  in  the  UK,  the  view  was  taken  that  the  royalties  should  at   least  benefit  the  victims  of  Nazi  per  secution,”  the  council  said  in  a  state   ment.   The  charity  decided  at  the  end  of  last  year  to  stop  accepting  the  roy  alties  because  “over  the  past  years  the  advice  and  support  work  devot  ed  to  victims  of  Nazi  persecution  has  steadily  declined  and  now  amounts  to  about  10  per  cent”  of  the  charity’s  total  caseload,  the   council  said.   No  figures  were  available  on  the   number  of  Jewish  Holocaust  sur  vivors  in  Britain.  The  council  now  focuses  most  of  its  efforts  on  helping  non-Jewish  Germans  who  live  in  Britain.   Hitler  wrote  Mein  Kampf  in  prison  in  1924  after  his  failed  Beer  Hall  putsch,  and  it  was  first  published  in   1925.   When  he  became  chancellor  of  Germany  in  1933,  the  book  became  a  required  school  text.  It  sold  in  the  millions,  and  for  many  years  was  Hitler’s  main  source  of   income.

"  A  proud  Jew   ON  Sunday,  I  stood  in  the  centre  of  Sydney  with  10,000  like-minded  Australians,  most  Jewish,  to  declare  our  support  for  Israel.  We  came  in  peace  and  we  spoke  of  peace.  Words  were  carefully  chosen  to  ensure  that  we  were  clear  to  the  world  that  our  condemnation  was  not  for  the  Palestinian  people  but  for  their  leaders  and  the  terrorists  whom  they  support.   I  have  never  felt  so  proud  to  be  an  Australian  Jew.  Our  work  is  far  from  over.  We  must  continue  to  speak  out  against  bias  and  distortions  in  the  media.  Don’t  let  a  misinformed  comment  at  work  or  in  social  circles   go  unchallenged.  If  we  don’t  challenge  distortions  and  misinformation  it  will  become  the  accepted  truth.

"  Jew  elected   Hawaii  governor   WASHINGTON  —  A  Republican  Jewish  woman  is  probably  looking  to  say  thank  you—or  “mahalo”—  to  the  national  Jewish  political  community  for  its  support.   Linda  Lingle,  49,  won  the  Hawaii  governor’s  race  last  week,  beating  the  state’s  Democratic  lieutenant  governor,  Mazie  Hirono.  Lingle  was  one  of  two  Jewish  governors  elected:  the  for  mer  mayor  of  Philadelphia,  Ed  Rendell,  beat  state  Attorney  General  Mike  Fisher  to  become  Pennsylvania’s  next  governor.   Lingle,  Hawaii’s  first  Republican  governor  in  40  years,  found  herself  attracting  national  attention,  as  Jewish,  Republican  and  women’s  groups  all  lent  their  support  for  her  run.   The  Jewish  vote  could  not  have  been  a  huge  factor  in  the  race,  as  there  are  only  an  esti  mated  10,000  Jews  in  Hawaii  out  of  a  total  population  of  more  than  1.2  million  people.

"  Far-right  Jew   causes  uproar   Magnus  Bennett   PRAGUE  —  A  far-right  Jewish  politi  cian  in  Austria  is  drawing  a  storm  of  protest  for  saying  the  Czech  Government  is  not  doing  enough  to  compensate  Holocaust  victims.   Peter  Sichrovsky,  a  member  of  Austria’s  Freedom  Party,  said  many  Czech  Jews  are  still  fighting  for  their  rights  after  being  refused  compensa  tion  for  decades  by  previous  Czech  governments.   He  called  on  Prague  to  “reconsider  the  consequences  of  racial  persecu  tion”  during  the  war  and  provide  “suf  ficient”  compensation.   The  statement  stung  the  Czech  Government,  which  has  been  embroiled  in  a  war  of  words  with  Austria  since  Czech  Prime  Minister  Milos  Zeman  described  the  former  leader  of  the  Austrian  Freedom  Party,  Jorg  Haider,  earlier  this  month  as  a  “pro-Nazi  politician”.   Czech  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Pavel  Rychetsky  described  Sichrovsky’s  statement  as  “an  outra  geous  lie”.   Rychetsky  said  that  in  1998  the  Czech  Government  established  a  spe  cial  commission  made  up  of  govern  ment  officials  and  Jewish  representatives  to  mitigate  “property  injustices”.  That  commission  investi  gated  the  fate  of  Holocaust-era  assets,  including  art,  real  estate  and  insur  ance  policies.  Rychetsky,  who  chairs  the  commission,  also  highlighted  the  government’s  role  in  establishing  an  $US8  million  (A$15,692,428)  endow  ment  fund  designed  to  compensate  and  support  Holocaust  victims.   Czedi  Jewish  leaders  agree  with  Rychetsky.   Jan  Munk,  president  of  the  Czech  Federation  of  Jewish  Communities,  said  Sichrovsky’s  comments  were  “ridiculous”  and  said  he  is  misin  formed.   Peter  Sichrovsky   “What  Sichrovsky  says  is  not  true,”  Munk  said.  “In  general,  the  restitution  process  in  the  Czech  Republic  has  been  successful.  It  has  been  running  for  about  seven  years  now.  All  property  that  it  has  been  possible  to  return  has  either  been  returned  or  could  still  be  claimed,”  Munk  said.   Sichrovsky  is  unrepentant.  He  argued  that  his  own  family  had  suf  fered  over  the  years  from  a  lack  of  action  by  the  Czechs.   He  said  his  mother,  who  is  from  Prague,  “fought  for  40  years  to  get  anything  back,  and  never  got  so  much  as  a  silver  spoon.  There  are  so  many  families  who  suffered  a  similar  fate,  and  I  think  the  Czech  government  must  do  more  on  restitution,”  he  said.   But  one  senior  Czech  Jewish  offi  cial  said  Sichrovsky’s  affiliation  with  the  Freedom  Party,  which  is  known  for  its  xenophobia  and  antisemitism,  makes  it  difficult  to  honour  his  criti  cism.   “It  is  hard  to  take  Sichrovsky’s  statements  seriously,”  said  the  offi  cial,  who  did  not  wish  to  be  named,  “when  he  is  a  member  of  a  party  that  is  not  noted  for  its  tolerant  views.”   JTA ",2002-02-08
"  Death  from  a  Jewish  perspective   When  a  Jew  Dies   Samuel  A  Heilman   University  of  California  Press,  271  pp,  $64.95  \  JMSm   Reviewed  by  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Cohen   OVER  the  past  decade,  a  number  of  books  have  been  published  which  reflect  on  a  Jewish  perspective  on  death.  These  include  Anita   Diamant’s  Saying  Kaddish:  How  to  Comfort  the  Dying  Bury  the  Dead  and  Mourn  as  a  Jew  (1999),  Maurice  Lamm’s  The  Jewish  Way  In  Death  and  Mourning  (2000),  Leon  Wieseltier’s  Kaddish  (1998)  and  Ron  Wolfson’s  A  Time  to  Mourn  A  Time  to  Comfort  (1993).  With  the  excep  tion  of  Wieseltier,  who  recounts  his  own  journey,  the  others  have  all  been“how-to”  books.   While  When  a  Jew  Dies  grew  out  of  Samuel  Heilman’s  experience  of  the  death  of  his  Holocaust-survivor  father,  it  is  as  much  an  academic’s  analysis  of  death  as  it  is  a  recount  ing  of  Heilman’s  own  journey.  A  social  anthropologist,  Heilman  has  published  a  number  of  studies  of   the  ultra-Orthodox  both  in  New  York  and  Jerusalem,  which  have  given  the  outsider  a  peek  into  the   Charedi  world.   The  main  focus  is  on  what  Heilman  describes  as  an  ethno   graphic  study  of  Jewish  mourning,  where  he  is  “the  social  anthropolog  ical  interpreter  of  customs  and  tra  ditions”.  Rather  than  speaking  about  one  particular  group  of  Jews   and  their  observances,  he  bundles  various  groups  together,  leaving  the  reader  uncertain  as  to  whether  his  study  applies  only  to  the  ultra  Orthodox,  modem  Orthodox,  or  to  observant  Liberal  Jews,  and  whether  it  has  any  relevance  to  sec  ular  Jews  at  all.   At  the  same  time,  the  author  Offers  a  compelling,  first-person  nar  rative  about  the  meaning  and  impact  on  himself,  but  does  not  give  any  other  individual  Jew’s  perspec   tive.  Here  it  is  the  voice  of  the  bereaved  son  who  acts  “according  to  the  imperatives  of  religious  obli  gation”.   Heilman’s  comprehensive  approach  to  the  whole  structure  of  Jewish  mourning  from  deathbed  through  the  first  year  to  yahrzeit  (anniversary  of  death)  and  yizkor  (memorial  prayer)  is  a  helpful  framework  and  he  makes  useful  observations  about  the  function  and  impact  of  the  cycles  and  rituals.  In  treating  the  entire  ritual  cycle  as  a  system,  he  is  able  to  point  out  the  ways  in  which  symbols,  themes  and  messages  form  a  coherent  whole,  which  affects  healing  and  transfor   mation.   Some  20  years  ago,  the  pioneer  of  Studies  in  Bereavement,  Dr  Colin  Murray-Parkes  of  Oxford  University  admonished  a  group  of  non  Orthodox  rabbis  for  letting  the  tra  ditional  cycles  of  mourning  disappear  in  their  desire  to  remain  modem  and  relevant.   Heilman  writes  that  the  entire   structure  of  Jewish  mourning  prac  tices  summon  the  mourner  out  of  his  or  her  desolation  to  connect   with  community,  noting  that  the  “congregation  is  the  antidote  to  death’s  abandonment”.  Standing  with  others,  who  are  at  different  points  in  that  first  year,  reminds  us  that  we  are  not  the  only  ones  who  are  mourning.   With  today’s  ageing  population,  it  is  not  uncommon  for  someone  in   his  or  her  fifties  never  to  have  expe  rienced  the  death  of  a  loved  one.  Also  there  are  some  new  trends,  including  women  wanting  to  recite  kaddish  (the  mourner’s  prayer)  on  a  daily  basis  and  the  need  for  Orthodox  synagogues  to  review  how  and  where  they  offer  a  daily  minyan  (prayer  service  requiring  the  presence  of  a  minimum  of  ten  men),  it  will  also  mean  a  different  level  of  sensitivity  from  that  tradi  tionally  displayed  in  an  Orthodox  minyan,  where  those  attending  have  asked  “how  many  people  are  here?”  when  what  they  really  mean  is  “how  many  men  are  here?""   When  a  Jew  Dies  may  reflect  what  applies  to  the  affiliated.  But  today  when  more  people  have  nei  ther  the  social  nor  the  liturgical   resources  to  make  Judaism’s  heal   ing  power  available  to  them,  it  is  an  important  contribution  to  the  study  of  bereavement  in  the  Jewish  tradi   tion.   ■  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Cohen  -is  literary  edi  tor  o  f  the  Australian  Jewish  News.

"  Balinese  and  Jewish   Peter  Kohn  speaks  to  a  Balinese-born  Jew  and  her  mother  about  their  ties  to  Bali  in  the  aftermath  of  the  October  12  bombings.   IN  her  childhood,  going  to  Jewish  events  in  Melbourne  was  a  challenge  for  Balinese-born  Dewi  Duggin.   “With  my  Asian  appearance,  peo  ple  would  look  at  me  and  the  ques  tion  in  their  eyes  seemed  to  be  ‘What’s  she  doing  here?’  It  seemed  as  if  they  couldn’t  understand  that  I’m  Jewish.”   It  is  a  curiosity  that  has  either  waned  or  does  not  seem  to  bother  her  as  much,  now  that  Ms  Duggin,  29,  is  married  and  has  a  three-year-old  daughter,  Pia.  _   The  Witorz  family  (clockwise  from  left)  Bronla,  Dewi,  Mia,  Amy  and  John.   But  she  admits  that  she  still  occa  sionally  receives  that  you-couldn’t  be-Jewish  reaction  from  some  Jewish  customers  with  whom  she  works  in  her  job  as  a  beauty  therapist.   “It  gets  me  in  on  some  of  the  gos  sip  around  the  Jewish  community,  because  they  just  assume  I’m  not  Jewish,”  she  quips.   Ms  Duggin  was  devastated  by  the  Kuta  bombings  of  October  12,  which  killed  at  least  187  people,  87  of  them  Australians.  “I  still  regard  Bali  as  my  second  home.  It’s  similar  to  the  way  I  feel  about  Israel,”  she  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.   Her  life  changed  when  she  was  adopted  through  the  Catholic  Church  as  an  infant  in  Bali  by  Bronia  and  John  Witorz  of  Melbourne.   She  has  two  sisters  —  Mia,  22,  bom  in  neighbouring  Surabaya  and  also  adopted  by  the  couple,  and  Amy,  20,  who  was  bom  into  the  family.   Attending  Sholem  Aleichem  College,  going  to  Temple  Beth  Israel,   where  she  and  her  sisters  had  their   bat  mitzvah,  and  joining  youth  groups  Hashomer  Hatzair  and  Habonim  Dror,  Ms  Duggin  had  a  typi  cal  Jewish  upbringing  —  except  that  she  had  to  deal  with  Melbourne’s  Jewish  community  and  its  assump  tions  about  how  Jews  look.   The  fact  that  her  husband  Blake  is  not  Jewish  has  made  her  even  more   determined  to  live  a  Jewish  life  and  raise  her  daughter  as  a  Jew,  which  she  does  by  observing  Shabby  and  going  to  Temple  Bethj   Israel.   Mrs  Witorz,  54,  a  guide  at  the  Jewish  Holocaust  Museum  and  a  member  of   Temple  Beth  Israel,  has  a   strong  affinity  to  Bali  and  Indonesia.

He  heard  of  an  opportu  nity  to  join  architects  planning  the  Bali  Hyatt  in  the  town  of  Sanur—and  the  couple  returned  for  an  extended  stay.  “We  fell  in  love  with  Bali,”  she   said.   Ms  Duggin,  bom  a  Hindu,  met  her  biological  parents  some  years  ago.  “It  was  an  emotional  experience,  but  in  a  very  positive  way.”   While  there  is  no  Jewish  commu   nity  in  Bali,  several  Jews  have  mar  ried  Indonesians,  mainly  in  Ubud.  But   n   lie   Mia  (right),  who  was  bom  in  Indonesia  and  adopted  by  Bronla  and  John  Witorz,  with  her  sister  Amy.   Mrs  Witorz  remembers  “about  half-a  dozen”  Jewish  families  in  Surabaya,  tracing  their  ancestry  to  Dutch   Jewish  traders  who  arrived  in  colo   nial  days.  There  was  even  a  syna  gogue  run  by  a  man  who  had  settled  in  Surabaya  from  Iran.   She  recalls  stories  of  how  the   police  in  Surabaya  placed  extra  secu  rity  around  the  homes  and  busi  nesses  of  Jews  and  at  the  synagogue  during  the  1973  Yom  Kippur  War  to  protect  the  community.   During  that  war,  she  was  invited  to  lunch  at  the  home  of  an  American   woman  married  to  an  Indonesian   imam  (Muslim  leader)  to  allay  her  fears.  As  for  the  Balinese,  they  “cerr  tainly  didn’t  have  any  problems  with   Jews  or  with  Israel”.   “As  someone  bom  in  Poland,  I’ve  always  talked  about  my  Jewish  iden  tity,  yet  I’ve  never  experienced  any  antisemitism  from  Indonesians,  either  in  Indonesia  or  in  Australia.”   “Indonesia  is  such  a  large  part  of  our  lives.

"  News®   Ukrainian  Jew  denied  refugee  status   Bernard  Freedman   A  UKRAINIAN  Jew  who  has  a  non  Jewish  wife  and  son  is  challenging  an  Australian  Refugee  Review  Tribunal  decision  to  reject  him  and  his  family  as  refugees  because  they  have  a  right  to  seek  refuge  in  Israel  under  its  Law   of  Return.   Federal  Court  Judge  Margaret  Stone  recently  dismissed  their  appli  cation  to  have  the  tribunal’s  decision  overturned,  saying  there  was  a  well  founded  principle  that  Australia  was  not  obliged  to  offer  protection  to  someone  who  has  a  right  to  “effective  protection”  elsewhere.   A  legal  authority  who  declined  to   be  identified  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  this  week  that  there   would  be  an  appeal  to  the  full  bench  of  the  Federal  Court,  arguing  that  the  case  is  important  because  it  has  cre   ated  a  situation  where  Jews  are  not   entitled  to  refugee  status  in  Australia.   Migration  law  does  not  allow  the  names  of  people  involved  in  refugee   appeal  cases  to  be  revealed  —  a  mat  ter  which  is  the  subject  of  a  High  Court  appeal.   Apart  from  the  fact  that  the  family  is  at  present  living  in  Sydney,  nothing  is  known  about  their  circumstances,  when  and  how  they  came  to  Australia  or  whether  they  have  relatives  here.   The  father  and  son  applied  for  Australian  protection  visas  three  years  ago,  claiming  a  fear  of  persecu  tion  if  they  return  to  Ukraine  because  of  the  political  opinions  of  the  father,  who  is  Jewish.   The  family  told  the  Refugee  Review  Tribunal  they  wanted  to  remain  in  Australia  and  not  go  to  Israel.  They  do  not  speak  Hebrew,  have  little  understanding  of  Jewish  culture  and  nothing  in  common  with   Israelis.   In  addition,  the  father’s  non  Jewish  wife  opposed  going  to  Israel,  the  father  said  he  did  not  agree  with  Israel’s  policy  towards  Palestinians  and  the  son  was  concerned  he  might  have  to  undergo  military  service.   But  the  tribunal  in  March  this  year  said  Australia  was  not  obliged  to  give  them  protection  because  they  could  have  “effective  protection”  in  Israel  under  its  Law  of  Return.   This  confirmed  Immigration  Minister  Philip  Ruddock’s  earlier  decision  not  to  grant  the  family  pro   tection  visas.   Australia  was  not  obliged  to  offer  protection  to  someone   with  a  right  to  “effective  protection”  elsewhere.   When  the  family  applied  to  the  Federal  Court  in  June  to  have  the  tri  bunal’s  decision  quashed  and  the  minister  restrained  from  acting  on  it,  lawyers  for  the  family  claimed  the  tri  bunal’s  decision  was  wrong  and  beyond  its  jurisdiction.   They  argued  that  the  principle   that  the  family  could  acquire  effective  protection  in  Israel  did  not  apply  because  they  had  never  been  there  and  had  no  wish  to  go  there.   Judge  Stone  rejected  this  argu  ment,  saying  the  tribunal  had  had  to  decide  on  the  facts  before  it  as  to  whether  Australia  had  obligations.   The  fact  that  a  person  had  never  been  to  a  third  country  was  “not  a  dis  tinguishing  feature”.   The  judge  also  rejected  J  Basten  QC’s  submission  that  refugee  applica  tions  “would  become  an  exercise  in   buck  passing”  if  signatories  to  the  Refugee  Convention  did  not  allow  bona  fide  refugees  to  obtain  protec  tion  in  any  convention  country.   The  judge  said  accepting  that  the  applicants  could  obtain  “effective  protection”  in  Israel  did  not  imply  that  Australia  would  be  able  to  avoid  any  convention  obligations  by  merely  referring  the  applicant’s  claims  to  another  convention  country.   The  tribunal’s  conclusion  that  the   applicants  could  have  effective  pro   tection  in  Israel  was  based  on  Israel’s  laws,  policy  and  specific  information  the  tribunal  obtained  from  the  Israeli  Embassy.   The  judge  rejected  the  contention  that  the  tribunal  was  not  entitled  to  consider  the  question  of  effective  protection,  saying  it  was  an  integral  part  of  the  inquiry  and  there  was  no  question  of  the  tribunal  not  having  jurisdiction  over  the  issue.   The  judge  said  Australia’s  1999  Border  Protection  Act  had  “de-lim  ited”  its  obligations  under  the  Refugee  Convention.  The  Act  said  Australia  was  not  obliged  to  protect  non-citizens  who  had  a  right  to  enter  another  country  where  they  would  not  be  persecuted.   While  the  tribunal  had  not  relied  on  the  border  protection  law  in  mak  ing  its  decision,  there  was  a  principle  that  Australia  was  not  obliged  to  offer  protection  to  someone  with  a  right  to  “effective  protection”  elsewhere.   The  judge  dismissed  the  applica   tion  with  costs. ",2002-12-20

"  AS  the  child  of  two  Holocaust  sur  vivors,  I  cannot  be  quiet  about  the  behaviour  of  Israel  and  its  govern  ment  toward  the  Palestinians.   History,  including  Jewish  history,  has  shown  us  time  and  time  again  how  dangerous  it  is  not  to  question  the  actions  of  leaders.  Let  us  not  evade  the  issues  behind  defensive  cries  of  antisemitism.   Ariel  Sharon  does  not  have  the  right  to  hijack  Jewish  morality.  The  Star  of  David  not  only  belongs  to  the  Israeli  flag,  it  is  a  symbol  of  Judaism   worldwide.   I  condemn  Palestinian  suicide  bombers;  I  have  family  in  Israel.  But  it  is  important  to  ask  why  Palestini  ans  resort  to  such  tactics.  How  would  we  feel  if  we  had  been  occu   pied  for  35  years  by  a  power  that  denied  us  basic  human  rights  and  decent  living  conditions?   In  1946  the  Irgun,  controlled  by  Menachem  Begin,  blew  up  the  King  David  Hotel  in  Jerusalem,  slaughter  ing  91  innocent  people.   In  1948  the  Palestinians  denounced  what  they  described  as  a  massacre  in  the  village  of  Deir   Yassin.   It  is  crucial  that  Jews  around  the  world,  as  well  as  in  Israel,  look  at  both  sides  and  judge  Sharon  as  if  he  were  a  world  leader  of  a  different  nation  in  a  different  conflict.   Israel  must  be  held  to  account  for   its  behaviour.   Jenny  Jackson   Oakleigh,  South  Vic ",2002-05-03

"  Jewish  lobby   HAS  it  occurred  to  Julia  Irwin  MP  that  if  the  “Jewish  lobby”  was  so  all  powerful,  she  and  her  views  would  be  wholly  inconsequential  (AJN  13/12/02)?

"  US  Senate’s  Jewish  ‘minyan’  grows   Who’s  a  Jew   —  in  Congress   US  ELECTIONS  2002   Sharon  Samber   NEW  YORK  —  The  following  is  a  list  of  Jewish  members  of  the  108th  Congress.  The  number  of  Jews  in  the  Senate  will  rise  from  10  to  11,  assuming  that  Norm  Coleman’s  victory  in  Minnesota  holds.  The  number  of  Jews  in  the  House  of  Representatives  will   remain  at  26.   WASHINGTON  —  With  Frank  Lautenberg’s  triumphant  return  to  the  Capitol  and  Norm  Coleman’s  vic  tory  in  Minnesota,  the  Senate’s  Jewish  minyan  is  safe  for  the  next  two  years  —  and  even  a  little  more  crowded.   In  the  House  of  Representatives,  one  new  Jewish  face  emerged  after  last  Tuesday’s  national  elections  —  Rahm  Emanuel,  the  former  Clinton  advisor.   In  an  indication  of  the  spectrum  of  Jewish  political  views,  Emanuel  will  join  Eric  Cantor,  a  staunch  con  servative  and  the  only  Jewish  Republican  left  in  the  house.   Overall,  the  Jewish  presence  in  Congress  stayed  almost  the  same,  with  11  senators  and  26  representa  tives.  The  107th  Congress  had  10  senators  and  27  representatives,  but  one  senator  and  one  representative  died  in  office.   In  Tuesday’s  election,  four  Jewish  candidates  were  vying  for  seats  in  the  Senate,  35  for  seats  in  the  House  of  Representatives  and  two  for  their  states’  governor’s  mansions,  both  of  whom  were  successful.   When  it  woke  on  Wednesday  morning,  the  nation  —  which  voted  for  36  governors,  all  435  members  of  the  House  of  Representatives  and  34  members  of  the  Senate  —  learned  that  the  Republicans  had  gained  full  control  of  Congress.   With  a  faltering  economy,  a  war   Rahm  Emanual   brewing  with  Iraq  and  the  Israeli  Palestinian  conflict  roiling  the  Middle  East,  Congress’  leadership  and  approach  after  these  elections  will  be  significant.   The  Republican  victory  in  the  Senate  could  affect  domestic  issues  that  are  important  to  the  Jewish  community.   Parts  of  the  Bush  administra  tion’s  agenda,  such  as  the  faith  based  initiative,  which  calls  for  opening  up  more  funding  to  religious  groups  to  provide  social  services,  might  be  advanced.  Congress  has  moved  slowly  on  the  initiative,  push  ing  the  White  House  to  pursue  change  through  means  other  than  legislation.   In  the  race  for  the  Senate,  vener  ated  Jewish  lawmaker  Lautenberg,  a  Democrat,  beat  his  Republican  opponent,  Doug  Forrester,  in  New   Brad  Sherman   Jersey.  Lautenberg,  a  former  chair  man  of  the  United  Jewish  Appeal  who  retired  from  the  Senate  in  2000,  stepped  into  the  race  in  October  to  replace  the  incumbent,  Senator  Robert  Torricelli,  who  quit  following  charges  of  ethics  violations.   In  addition  to  his  support  for  Israel  and  his  strong  Jewish  commu  nal  connections,  Lautenberg  is  well  known  for  his  work  in  assisting  immi  grants,  resulting  in  a  1990  measure  that  required  immigration  officials  to  take  into  account  historical  persecu  tion  when  judging  an  applicant’s  refugee  status.   The  Lautenberg  Amendment,  which  is  still  in  effect,  allowed  many   Jews  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  —  some  350,000  to  400,000  by  the  senator’s  count  —  to  gain  entry  to  the  United  States  without  having  to  prove  they  were  persecuted.

"  Knesset  member  calls  diplomat  ‘Jew-boy’   Naomi  Segal   JERUSALEM  —  An  Israeli  lepffator   has  caused  an  outcry  in  the  Knesset  after  calling  the  US  ambassador  to  Israel  “a  Jew-boy”.   Knesset  member  Zvi  Hendel,  a  member  of  the  National  Union  Israel,  Our  Home  faction,  was  reacting  to  Daniel  Kurtzer’s  remarks  that  Israel  should  allocate  funds  for  the  disabled  and  not  for  Jewish  settlements.   The  ambassador’s  remarks  came   against  the  backdrop  of  a  prolonged  dispute  between  disabled  Israelis  and  the  government  for  increased   benefits.  Demonstrators  launched  a  sitdown  strike  in  government  buildings  in  Jerusalem  over  three  weeks  ago.   Hendel  said  Kurtzer’s  remarks  were  out  of  place   Daniel  Kurtzer   and  criticised  the  ambassador  for  “meddling  in  internal  affairs”.   The  Prime  Minister’s  Office  soon  weighed  in,  saying  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  “strongly”  condemned   Hendel’s  remarks.   Kurtzer  is  known  as  a  strong  supporter  of  the  Israeli-Palestinian  peace  process  and  an  opponent  of  Israeli  settlements  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  Strip.   Hendel’s  derisive  comments   prompted  outrage  in  the  Knesset,  which  quickly  divided  along  ideological  lines.   “If  that  antisemite  Zvi  Hendel  now  calls  me  a  ‘Jew-boy’,  I’ll  wear  the  label  with  pride,”  opposition  leader   Yossi  Sarid  said.   Sarid  added  that  he  agrees  with  Kurtzer’s  remarks.   Labour  faction  leader  Efi  Oshaya  lodged  a  complaint  over  Hendel’s   remarks  with  the  Knesset  Ethics  Committee.  Deputy  Foreign  Minister  Michael  Melchior  said  Hendel  had  violated  the  honour  of  the  Knesset  and  inflicted  harm  on  the  Jewish   people.   The  dispute  mirrors  one  several  years  ago  when  right-wing  legislator   Rehavam  Ze’evi  called  then-US  ambassador  Martin  Indyk,  one  of  the  architects  of  the  peace  process,  a  “Jew-boy”  for  not  supporting  a   more  nationalist  Israeli  line.   The  last  time  someone  called  me   that,  he  got  a  punch  in  the  face,  Indyk  replied,  and  the  two  almost   came  to  blows.   JTA ",2002-01-11
"  Demonised,  even  though  I’m  not  Jewish   VIEWPOINT   Peter  Olszewski   I  OFTEN  jokingly  refer  to  myself  as   an  ersatz  Jew,  or  a  Jew  who  is  not  actually  Jewish.  As  such,  I  often  gain  a  unique  insight  into  racism,  and  especially  antisemitism.   The  situation  arises  because  of  my  surname,  which  most  people   assume  is  Jewish.   I  consider  myself  to  be  of  Polish  Catholic  heritage,  although  even  that’s  tricky  because  while  my  father  was  Polish,  my  mother  is  German  Lutheran  and  I  was  born  in  Germany  but  raised  in  Australia  —  firstly  as  a  Salvo,  then  as  a  Catholic.  My  pass  port  defines  me  as  Australian.   Confusion  arises  because  in  Poland  most  people  are  Catholic  and  a  very  small  percentage  are  Jewish.  But  in  Melbourne,  where  I  lived,  it  was  the  other  way  around  —  most  Polish  refugees  were  Jewish,  with  a  smattering  of  Polish  Catholics.   Many  Polish  Jews  have  Polish   names  which  often  end  in  “ski”.  Many  Polish  Jews,  such  as  record  company  mogul  Michael  Gudinski,  are  proud  of  their  heritage.   Hence,  many  people  assume  that  a  name  with  “ski”  on  the  end  denotes  Jewishness.   I  also  have  a  nose  that  can  be  described  positively  as  a  traditional  Slavic  hawk-like  nose,  or  negatively  as  a  Jewish  Shylock  hooked  nose.   A  singer  once  wrote  a  song  about  me,  and  a  line  in  the  chorus  gleefully  referred  to  my  “great  big  Hebie  honker”.  Which  again  led  people  to   believe  I  was  Jewish.   What  makes  this  interesting  is  that  at  regular  intervals  through  my  life,  I’ve  been  confronted  with  the  creepiness  and  insidiousness  that  is   antisemitism.   The  sheer  hate  and  evil  of  the  insults  that  are  spat  at  me  surprises  me,  but  what  surprises  me  more  is   who  harbours  such  twisted  beliefs.   You  expect  ignorance  from  red  necks  and  hoons,  but  often  it’s  the  seemingly  ordinary  decent  people  whose  faces  contort  with  hate  and  contempt  as  they  spit  out  insults  and  tell  me  it’s  a  pity  that  somehow  my  folks  escaped  the  gas  chambers.   I  hate  defending  myself  by  saying  “Hey,  I’m  not  Jewish”  because  I  fear  that  I  might  be  colluding  with  them,   that  I  don’t  have  issue  with  what  they  say  and  that  my  only  objection  is  that  they’ve  got  the  wrong  guy.   “You  expect  ignorance  from   rednecks  and  hoons,  but   often  it's  seemingly  decent  people  who  tell  me  it’s  a  pity   that  my  folks  escaped  the   gas  chambers.”   So  I  simply  walk  away.   But  it  also  illustrates  how  stupid  such  isms,  whether  they  be  racism  or  antisemitism,  are.  At  one  moment  I  can  be  a  candidate  for  the  gas  oven,  the  next  moment  I’m  not,  and  all  along  I’ve  been  the  same  person.   Such  thoughts  have  been  passing  through  my  mind  of  late  because  I’ve  noticed  that  the  chill  winds  of  anti  semitism  are  blowing  again  in  the  wake  of  increasing  hostilities  in  the  Israel-Palestinian  conflict.   Recently,  this  newspaper  high  lighted  the  Brisbane  Courier  Mail's  stereotypical  depiction  of  Ariel  Sharon  complete  with  a  big  Hebie  honker,  but  Sharon’s  nose  is  decid  edly  “non-Jewish”  in  appearance.   The  Courier  MaiFs  cartoon  repre  sents  the  cheapest  form  of  ridicule  —  give  a  person  a  hooked  nose,  depict  him  as  a  Shylock  and  there  you  have  it,  the  stereotypical  Jew.   I  lecture  in  Communications  at  a   university,  and  for  the  first  time  in  three  years  I’ve  detected  sniggering  sotto  voce  references  from  students  to  my  perceived  Jewishness.   This  again  places  me  in  the  conundrum  I  face  as  an  ersatz  Jew.  A  smart  arse  at  the  back  of  a  lecture  theatre  mumbles  an  anti-Jewish  slur  and  40  pair  of  eyes  stare  at  me,  wait  ing  for  a  reaction.   What  do  I  do?  If  I  declare  that  I’m   not  Jewish,  I  could  be  seen  as  con  doning  the  slur.  And  what  about  the  Jewish  students  present?  A  declara  tion  of  my  non-Jewishness  could  be  seen  as  further  marginalising  them.   So  I  shut  up  and  get  on  with  it,  and  thank  publications  such  as  the  Courier  Mail  for  again  presenting  me  as  a  source  of  ridicule  because  I  have  a  great  big  Hebie  honker.   Many  of  my  peers  can  loosely  be  labelled  as  part  of  the  trendy  left  intelligentsia  where  pro-Palestinian  stances  are  becoming  the  norm.   What  I  now  notice  is  that  at  din  ner  parties  the  Palestine  question  is  inevitably  raised,  prompting  heated  discussion  with  its  attendant  anti  American  and  anti-Israel  overtones.   As  soon  as  someone  gets  stuck  into  Israel,  people  remember  I’m  present,  and  suddenly  there’s  an  awkward  silence  with  a  few  sidelong   glances  to  see  how  I’m  reacting.   When  this  last  happened,  I  did  give  in  to  the  “Hey,  I’m  not  Jewish,  but...”  response.   I  explained  that  I  have  many  Jewish  friends  and  that  opinions  among  them  can  be  as  varied  as  opinions  at  this  dinner  party,  that  there  are  right-wing  Jews,  left-wing  Jews  and  in-between  Jews  and  that  Israel  is  perhaps  more  of  a  political  issue  than  a  classic  Jewish  issue.   I  noticed  one  woman  giving  me  a  steely  look.  She  said:  “So  if  you’re  not  Jewish,  what  then  is  your  back  ground?  Were  your  families  Nazis?”   I  realised  then  what  I’ve  known  all   along  —  that  as  an  ersatz  Jew,  I  can’t   win.   ■  Peter  Olszewski  is  a  lecturer  in  Communications  at  the  University  of  the  Sunshine  Coast,  Queensland.

"  Jew  backs  Green  Party  anti-Israel  motion   Danya  Levy   THE  NSW  Greens   Party  has  called  on  the  Australian  Gov  ernment  to  suspend  diplomatic  relations   with  Israel  —  a  move   being  championed  by  its  Jewish  MP  but   which  has  forced  the   resignation  of  its  local  Jewish  political  secretary.   The  motion  was   tabled  at  the  party’s  State  Delegates  Council  meeting  last  week.  It  calls  for  the  Israeli  Government  to  “immediately  withdraw  Israeli   Arthur  Hurwitz  walked  out.   forces  from  Palestinian  territory,  including   from  the  Israeli  settlements”.  It  also  appeals  for  Israel  to  enter  into  negotiations  with  the  Palestinian  Authority  “irrespective  of  further  violence”,  and  it  requests  UN  sanctions  against  Israel.   The  party  also  calls  on  the  Palestinians  to  do  everything  in  their  power  “to  prevent  fur  ther  suicide  bombings  against  civilian  tar  gets”.   MP  and  member  of  the  NSW  Legislative  Council  Ian  Cohen  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  this  week  that  Jewish  tradition  taught  him  to  learn  from  history.  “I  am  part  of  a  growing  voice  for  peace  in  the  Middle  East,  with  Jewish  people  speaking  out  against  the   level  of  violence.”   He  said  the  extent  of  military  action  against  Palestinians  on  the  West  Bank  is   “unconscionable”.   “Israel’s  military  retaliation  is  beyond  what  is  acceptable  to  civilised  society.   “It  doesn’t  benefit  the  debate  to  say  who  started  this.  What  we  are  looking  at  is  how  to  break  the  cycle  of  violence.”   As  an  Australian  Jew  who  “abhors  racism  and  attacks  on  Jewish  people”,  Mr  Cohen  said  he  had  been  the  subject  of  antisemitic   attacks.  But  the  motion  prompted  Jewish  Green  Party  member  Arthur  Hurwitz  to  storm  out  of  the  meeting.   Mr  Hurwitz,  a  party  member  for  the  past  three  years,  ran  unsuccessfully  as  a  candi  date  in  last  year’s  federal  election  for  the  Kingsford  Smith  seat  and  for  Randwick  City   Council  in  2000.   “Calling  for  sanctions  blames  one  side  and  one  side  only,”  he  said.  “They  tried  to  put  the  boot  into  Israel  —  they  see  it  as  a   vote-winner.”   He  and  one  other  non-Jewish  party  mem  ber  were  the  only  people  to  speak  against  the  motion,  he  said.  Six  people  spoke  in   favour.   Mr  Hurwitz,  who  attended  the  meeting  with  his  wife  Shani  Gabai,  a  social  worker  for  JewishCare,  did  not  wait  for  the  motion  to  be  voted  on.  “It  was  obvious  it  was  going  to  be  passed.   “Israel's  military  retaliation  is  beyond  what  is  acceptable   to  civilised  society.”   Ian  Cohen,  Green  MP   “I  just  couldn’t  deal  with  it  at  that  point.  I  was  sitting  at  the  head  of  the  table  and  my  wife  and  I  looked  at  each  other.  She  knew  what  1  was  going  to  do.  I  picked  up  my  papers  and  we  walked  out.”   Mr  Hurwitz  has  now  resigned  as  secretary  for  the  Randwick-Botany  Greens.  “I  put  my  heart  and  soul  into  the  party  and  this  is  a  stab  in  the  back.  Jewish  people  should  know  this  is  where  the  party  lies.”   A  policy  working  group  on  the  Middle  East  set  up  by  the  Greens  last  December,  which  Mr  Hurwitz  is  part  of,  has  been  “total  ly  undercut”  by  the  motion,  he  said.   The  motion  was  introduced  as  a  response  to  an  urgent  situation,  Mr  Cohen  said.  “There  is  a  strong  feeling  in  the  Greens  that  this  urgency  had  to  be  acted  on.” ",2002-04-26

"  Insight  into  Jewish  divorce   The  Get:  a  spiritual  memoir  of  divorce   Ellse  Edelson  Katch   Simcha  Press,  2002,  284  pages,  $24.95   Reviewed  by  Ellen  Mandel   WITH  divorce  more  and  more  preva  lent  in  today’s  world,  discussion  has  returned  to  the  question  of  how  can  and  should  marriages  be  dissolved.  Some  in  the  non-Jewish  world  have  looked  to  the  gett,  or  religious  divorce  developed  in  Jewish  tradi  tion,  as  one  model.  And  yet  for  the  average  Jew,  the  gett  is  something  surrounded  in  mystery,  for  while  a  wedding  happens  so  publicly,  divorce  happens  quietly.   There  have  been  a  number  of  writings  from  Jewish  feminists  recently  about  the  dissolution  of   marriage.  The  traditional  process  requires  little  participation  from  the  woman,  except  to  catch  the  docu  ment  especially  written  for  the  occa  sion.  The  traditional  ceremony  is  usually  the  last  step  after  all  the  legalities  have  been  completed.  Sometimes  it  has  been  the  last  bat  tleground  for  the  failed  marriage.   Katch  is  a  Denver  social  worker  who  describes  the  “surgical  finality”  of  its  power  as  one  of  both  hurt  and  healing.  Frightened  by  her  sense  of  loss  and  loneliness  in  the  wake  of  separation  from  her  husband,  Katch   “Initially  fearful  of   participating  for  she  is  required  to  stand  alone   before  a  panel  of  emotionally  distant  Orthodox  rabbis,  she  ultimately  comes  to  believe   that  the  gett  is  truly  a   profound  emotional   experience.”   balks  at  proceeding  with  the  gett  until  she  can  no  longer  stall.  Her  pro  crastination  stems  partly  from  her  feeling  that  divorce  is  a  “wound  in  the  universe”  and  partly  from  the  divergent  spiritual  path  htakes,  immersing  himself  in  an  ultra  Orthodox  world  far  from  the  less  observant  community  she  attends.   For  someone  living  in  the  “mod  em  world”  to  enter  into  the  world  of  the  “black  hats”,  as  she  calls  the  ultra-Orthodox  community,  must  have  been  strange  and  she  describes   it  as  a  sense  of  being  powerless:  I  suddenly  felt  as  though  I  were  an  American  citizen  alone  in  Iraq  and  government  officials  were  walking   me  down  to  a  dark  basement  room...”  Not  all  batei  din  are  as  daunting  and  similar  descriptions  could  probably  be  made  about  our  secular  court  system.   For  most  of  us  the  whole  process  is  clouded  in  mystery.  Her  in-depth  description  of  the  ceremony  opens  the  door  for  the  reader.  Initially  fear  ful  of  participating  for  she  is  required  to  stand  alone  before  a  panel  of  emotionally  distant  Orthodox  rabbis,  she  ultimately  comes  to  believe  that  the  gett  is  truly  a  profound  emotional  experience.  Though  she  says  the  gett  helped  her  move  beyond  anger  and  bitterness,  she  provides  little  insight  into  that  transformative  process.   Katch’s  simple  narrative,  often  heavy  and  monotonous,  is  broken  by  flashbacks  and  pointless  poem  like  asides  (“The  house  where/  all  the/  kids/  hung  out”).   This  book  details  a  process  that  has  rarely  been  told  before.  It  takes  us  through  an  experience  of  anxiety  and  intensity  until  the  moment  of  finality  is  reached,  when  a  single  piece  of  parchment  —  representing  a  life  together  —  is  dropped  into  the  author’s  hands  and  cut  asunder.  Readers  who  reach  the  end  of  the  story,  compelled  by  the  hope  that  Katch  will  finally  free  herself  from  depression  (she  does),  will  find  poignancy  in  her  decision  to  recite  the  kaddish,  the  mourner’s  prayer,  as  a  memorial  to  her  marriage.

"  Searching  for  Jewish  ANZACs   Bernard  Freedman   AUSTRALIAN  Jews  played  a  remarkable  part  in  the  two  world  wars.  And  yet,  after  all  the  years  that  have  passed,  the  full  story  has  not  yet  been  told.   At  the  Australian  War  Memorial  in  Canberra,  Margaret  Beadman,  a  member  of  the  local  Jewish  community,  has  for  the  past  13  years  been  researching  the  history  of  the  Jewish  men  and  women  who  died  in  the  two  wars.   A  volunteer  worker  in  the  War  Memorial’s  education  branch,  she  devotes  days  of  her  spare  time  to  a  complex  and  seemingly  unending  search  for  information  scattered  across  Australia  and  the  world.   “[It’s]  a  labour  of  love  and  interest,”  she  says  of  her  search,  which  began  with  the  102,000  names  inscribed  on  tall  bronze  panels  lining  the  cloister  walls  of  the  War  Memorial  —  60,000  Australian  servicemen  who  died  in  World  War  1  and  42,000  others  who  died  in  World  War  II.   “When  I  looked  at  them,  I  wondered  how  many  Jewish  servicemen  there  were,”  she  says.   She  has  accumulated  documents  from  deep  in  the  War  Memorial’s  archives,  rolls  of  honour  erected  in  synagogues,  casualty  lists  published  in  Australia  and  overseas,  ships’  embarkation  rolls,  Commonwealth  War  Graves  documents,  lists  compiled  by  Jewish  chaplains  and  personal  papers.   “I  look  into  private  records,  search  for  photographs,  diaries,  personal  service  records,  decorations,  mentions  in  despatches  —  every  piece  of  paper  I  have  been  able  to  grab  that  may   Private  Sam  Weingott,  22,  was  bom  in  Annandale,  Sydney,  one  of  two  brothers  who  died  of  wounds  received  at  Gallipoli.   give  me  a  clue  to  Jewish  servicemen  who  fought  and  died  for  Australia,”  she  says.   “Sometimes  a  chance  con  versation  with  someone  who  visits  the  War  Memorial  or  someone  who   seeks  help  about  a  relative  leads  on  to  another  source  of  information.”   The  searching  takes  a  long  time  because  most  memorial  panels  and  rolls  of  honour  give  no  indication  of  religion.   Some  men  enlisted  under  false  names  or  Anglicised  their  names;  others  falsely  described  their  religion.  On  the  other  hand,  some  with  Jewish-sounding  names  turn  out  to  be  not  Jewish.  “I’ve  found  quite  a  few  Cohens  who  aren’t  Jewish,”  says  Mrs  Beadman,  “and  Browns  and  Smiths  that  are.”   The  one  part  of  her  task  she  feels  she  has  completed  is  the  identification  of  55  Jewish  Diggers   Margaret  Beadman  has  spent  13  years  as  a  voluntary  worker  at  the  Australian  War  Memorial  in  Canberra  searching  for  Australian  Jews  who  died  in  both  world  wars.

"  Christian-Jewish  solidarity  day   A  SOLIDARITY  day  will  be  held  by  the  Evangelical  Sisters  of  Mary  on  Sunday  to  bless  the  Jewish  community.   Concerned  about  growing  antisemitism,  and  the  failure  of  Christians  through  the  cen  turies  to  support  “their  Jewish  brethren”,  the  Sisters  of  Mary  have  planned  a  gathering  for  Jews  and  Christians,  with  choral  items  by  the  B’nai  B’rith  Choir.   In  conjunction  with  the  Australian  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews,  the  Sisters  organised  a  similar  repentance  service  in  Sydney  last  year.  About  800  Christians  attended,  as  did  Rabbis  Raymond  Apple,  Richard  Lampert,  Allison  Conyer,  Israeli  Consul-General  Ephraim  Ben   Matityahu  and  Holocaust  survivors.   Last  year  the  Sisterhood  organised  a  Jerusalem  convention.  About  1000  Christians  from  20  countries  went  to  Israel  to  express  repentance,  and  a  pledge  of  support  signed  by  32,500  people  was  presented  to  Israel.

"  JewishCare  visiting  Argentina   JEWISHCARE  federal  president  Eva  Fischl  and  CEO  Steve  Denenberg  are  currently  vis  iting  Argentina  to  assess  the  situation  first  hand  concerning  the  plight  of  the  Argentine  Jewish  community.   Like  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Argentines,  a  large  proportion  of  the  com  munity  has  been  hard  hit  by  the  economic  crisis  plaguing  the  country.   Ms  Fischl  and  Mr  Denenberg  are  in  Argentina  for  a  week  as  .  guests  of  the  Tzedakah  Foundation  and  the  American  Joint  Distribution  Committee  (JDC).   Ms  Fischl  is  funding  her  trip,  while  the  Pratt  Foundation  has  provided  funds  for  Mr  Denenberg’s  trip.   “As  the  local  community  has  charged  JewishCare  Australia  with  co-ordinating  the  Australian  response  to  the  Argentine  crisis,  the  trip  is  fundamental  in  helping  us  to  iden  tify  how  we  can  best  help  the  Argentinean  community  in  the  wake  of  the  country’s  eco  nomic  crisis,”  Ms  Fischl  said  on  the  eve  of   her  departure  for  Buenos  Aires.   The  trip  to  Argentina  has  three  primary  aims,  she  said:   •  to  show  the  members  of  the  Jewish  community  in  Argentina,  who  face  an  uncer  tain  future,  that  they  are  not  alone,  and  to  express  solidarity  with  them  and  extend  greetings  on  behalf  of  the  Jewish  community  in  Australia;   •  to  assess  the  impact  of  this  crisis  on  the  Jewish  community  in  Argentina  and  deter  mine  how  the  community  here  can  assist  Argentines  who  are  most  vulnerable  and  in  need  of  support;   •  to  provide  information  about  Australia  to  Argentine  Jews  who  may  wish  to  settle  in  Australia,  particularly  those  interested  in  moving  to  smaller  communities  such  as  Adelaide  and  the  ACT.   “When  we  return,  we  look  forward  to  meeting  with  the  local  community  and  pro  posing  a  co-ordinated  and  effective  response  to  this  crisis,”  Ms  Fischl  said.

"  German  Jewish  leader  Michel  Friedman  called  a  new  financial  agreement  between  the  government  and  the  Jewish  community  “extraordinary”.   Germany  triples  Jewish  funding   BERLIN  —  The  German  Govern  ment  has  agreed  to  dramatically  increase  its  financial  support  for  the  country’s  Jewish  community  at  a  time  of  increased  concern  about  antisemitism  here.   For  the  first  time  since  the  end  of  World  War  II,  the  federal  gov  ernment  is  establishing  a  contrac  tual  relationship  with  the  Central  Council  of  Jews  in  Germany.   The  development  was  announced  at  a  news  conference  last  Thursday  by  Chancellor  Gerhard  Schroeder  and  central  council  president  Paul  Spiegel.   According  to  the  contract,  Germany  will  triple  its  annual  budget  for  the  central  council—to  nearly  $US3  million  —  to  meet  the   needs  of  a  Jewish  population  that  has  grown  threefold  since  1990  with  the  arrival  of  immigrants  from  the  former  Soviet  Union.   The  contract,  which  will  be  sim  ilar  to  those  with  the  Protestant  and  Catholic  churches,  still  must  be  approved  by  the  parliament.   “It  is  a  historical  situation,  and  it  proves  that  the  German  Govern  ment  is  not  only  aware  of  the  new  Jewish  community  here  but  also  supports  it  and  welcomes  it,”  Spiegel  told  JTA.  “I  am  veiy  happy.”   Germany’s  Jewish  population  has  risen  from  about  30,000  in  1990  to  about  100,000  today.   Before  Hitler  came  to  power  in  1933,  there  were  about  500,000   Jews  in  Germany.   ha ",2002-11-22
"  Drugs  and  Jewish  law   Rabbi  Raymond  Apple   Neither  kashrut  principles   nor  any  other  specific  Torah  law  refers  to  drugs  per  se.  Does  taking  drugs  infringe  on  Jewish  law?   JUDAISM  cannot  ignore  the  widespread  prob  lem  of  drug  abuse,  not  only  because  of  its  individual,  family  and  social  effects,  but  because  drug  taking  infringes  basic  halachic  principles.   1.  The  first  principle  is  that  our  bodies  belong  to  the  Holy  One,  blessed  be  He  (Rambam,  Hilchot  Rotze’ach  1:4;  Shulchan  Aruch  HaRav,  Choshen  Mishpat,  Nizkei  HaGuf  4).  The  Torah  establishes  the  principle,  “You  shall  diligently  guard  your  life”  (Devarim  4:15);  the  Rambam  says,  “It  is  forbidden  for  a  person  to  injure  himself  or  another”  (Hilchot  Chovel  U’Mazzik  5:1;  cf.  Shulchan  Aruch,  Choshen  Mishpat420:31).  We  are  not  permitted  to  harm,  mutilate,  destroy  or  even  take  risks  with  our  body,  life  or  health.   Smoking,  immoderate  use  of  alcohol,  and  drug  taking  all  threaten  the  body  which  belongs  to  God.  The  Talmud  insists  that  “regu  lations  concerning  danger  to  life  are  more  stringent  than  ritual  prohibitions”  (Chullin  K)a).   Yes,  some  rabbis  refused  to  ban  smoking  on  the  basis  that  “The  Lord  protects  the  sim  ple”  (Psalm  116:6),  but  knowing  now  how  much  danger  is  likely  as  a  result  of  smoking,  halachic  opinion  is  much  more  negative  than  before  on  the  subject.  In  relation  to  drug  taking  the  principle  would  be  the  Talmudic  state  ment,  “Where  injury  is  likely  one  must  not  rely  on  a  miracle”  (Kiddushin  39b).  The  danger  may  not  always  be  immediate,  but  jeopardising  one’s  long-term  future  is  also  a  major  consid   eration.   2.  Man  is  made  in  the  Divine  image   (Bereshit  1:26)  and  endowed  with  free  will  (Devarim  11:26,  30:15).  Under  the  influence  of  drugs,  as  Rabbi  Moshe  D  Tendler  puts  it,  man  “becomes,  for  varying  lengths  of  time,  a  lobotomised  caricature  of  this  noble  creature  that  bears  the  Godly  image”  (Judaism  and  Drugs,  edited  by  Leo  Landman,  1973,  p64).   3.  Man  is  made  as  both  an  individual  and  a  member  of  society.  Drug  taking  affects  one’s  ability  to  be  a  socially  responsive  and  respon  sible  person.   The  habit  needs  constant  feeding,  and  the  wherewithal  has  to  come  from  somewhere,   often  from  petty  pilfering  and  sometimes,  quite  serious  criminality.  It  also  “necessi  tates  contact  with  the  morally  degraded  ele  ments  of  our  society”  —  the  drug  barons  (Tendler).  The  drug  addict  becomes  enslaved  not  only  to  the  drug  substances  but  also  to  drug  sellers.   “To  me  are  the  children  of  Israel  servants,”  says  the  Almighty  (Vayikra  25:55),  “and  not  servants  to  [other]  servants”  add  the  sages  (Bava  Kamma  116b).   4.  Using  judiciously  chosen  drugs  for  ther  apeutic  purposes  under  the  direction  of  a  competent  physician  is  one  thing.  Resorting  to  drugs  in  order  to  escape  from  reality,  to  attempt  to  become  a  different  person,  to  heighten  one’s  mood  —  that  is  something  else.  Halacha  believes  that  a  person  who  wants  a  high  should  find  it  in  the  ecstasy  of  spiritual  communion  with  God,  the  exhilara  tion  of  Torah  study,  the  supreme  joy  of  doing  a  mitzvah  (Eruvin  54b).  True,  some  attribute  to  historical  figures  like  the  Ba’al  Shem  Tov  certain  addictive  habits,  but  the  evidence  is  scanty,  despite  Professor  Yaffa  Eliach’s  attempt  to  show  that  the  Ba’al  Shem  reached  spiritual  highs  because  he  “smoked  some  thing  other  than  tobacco”  (Proceedings  of  the  American  Academy  for  Jewish  Research,  vol.  36,  1968,  pp57-83).   ""Regulations  concerning   danger  to  life  are  more  stringent   than  ritual  prohibitions.”   Chullln  10a   Dr  Walter  Wurzburger  warns  that  for  Judaism,  “Proximity  to  God  cannot  be  reached  by  putting  oneself  into  a  trance  either  through  physical  or  chemical  means.”  Even  when,  he  adds,  “through  a  supernatural  gift  of  prophecy,  an  individual  is  privileged  to  behold  the  heavenly  mysteries  —  as  Rabbi  Soloveitchik  put  it  so  convincingly  in  The  Lonely  Man  of  Faith  —  he  must  ultimately  return  from  his  journey  into  the  higher  regions  of  being  with  a  socio-ethical  message  that  is  geared  to  man’s  task  on  earth”  (Judaism  and  Drugs,  edited  by  Leo  Landman,  1973).”   The  severity  of  the  halacha  in  its  attitude  to  drugs  is  unambiguous.  This  is  not  to  say  that  we  are  entitled  to  be  holier  than  thou,  judgmental  or  condemnatory.  An  imperative  of  the  halacha  is  “Love  your  neighbour  as  yourself”  (Vayikra  19:18).  In  addressing  the  drug  problem,  whatever  energies  we  can  har  ness  both  as  Jews  and  concerned  citizens  must  be  exerted  constructively  and  with  com  passion.  And  as  always  we  have  to  encourage  people  to  “take  a  trip”  in  Judaism  and  Jewish  spirituality,   9  Reprinted  from  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple’s  email  list:  torah@greatsynagogue.org.au ",2002-07-05

December  2001   BUENOS  AIRES  —  Responding  to  the  deepening  economic  and  political  crisis  in  Argentina,  Israel  announces  a  new  plan  of  financial  benefits  to  increase  Argentinean  Jewish  aliyah.  The  roughly  200,000  Argentinean   Jews,  many  of  whom  are  members  of  the  middle  class,  have  been  hard  hit  by  the  crisis,  which  began  with  street  riots  in  December.   January  2002   PARIS  —  A  series  of  attacks  against  Jewish  sites  in  Paris  draws  demonstrators  and  a  condemnation   by  President  Jacques  Chirac.  Attacks  include  suspected  arson  at  a  Jewish  school,  rock-throwing  at  one  synagogue  and  gasoline  bombs  and   stones  directed  at  another.   NEW  YORK  —  A  court  rules  that  two  men  convicted  for  their  role  in  the  killing  of  Australian  Chassid  Yankel  Rosenbaum  during  the  1991  Crown  Heights  riots  did  not  receive  a  fair  trial.  A  new  trial  is  ordered,  frustrating  many  Jewish  leaders.  But  the  court  also  upholds  the  legitimacy  of  the  federal  civil  rights  statute  under  which  the  defendants  were  charged,  a  move  seen  as  a  victory  by  Jewish  leaders.   TEHRAN  —  An  Iranian  Jew  convicted  of  spying  for  Israel  is  freed  from  jail  after  serving  a  three-year  sentence.  Faramarz  Kashi,  a  Hebrew  teacher,  is  the  second  of  10  Iranian  Jews  released  after  being  convicted  on  spying  charges  in  July  2000.   February  2002   WASHINGTON  —  The  death  of  kidnapped  Wall  Street  Journal  reporter  Daniel  Pearl  is  announced   by  US  State  Department  officials  who  have  viewed  a  videotape  showing  Pearl’s  throat  being  slit,  and  his  subsequent  decapitation.  Just  before  his  murder,  Pearl  is  taped  telling  his  kidnappers  that  he  is  Jewish.  EViardi  2002   BERLIN  —  Authorities  say  right-wing  extremists  or  Arab  terrorists  are  behind  a  grenade  explosion  at  a  Jewish  cemetery.   NEW  YORK  —  A  controversial  exhibit  of  Holocaust  art  opens  at  the  Jewish  Museum.  Critics  say  Mirroring  evil:  Nazi  imagery/recent  art”,   offensive  and  insensitive  to  Holocaust  survivors,  while  its  defenders  say  the  exhibit  shows  how  a  new  generation  of  artists  have  incorporated  the  Holocaust  into  their  work.  The  controversy  dies  down  after  many  critics  pan  the   exhibit.   BERLIN  —  A  rabbinical  student  visiting  from  the  United  States  is  attacked  on  the  street  while  walking  with  a  friend.  The  perpetrators  are  believed  to  be  of  Middle  Eastern  descent.   April  2002   JERBA  —  A  truck  filled  with  natural  gas  crashes  into  a  historic  synagogue  on  a  Tunisian  island,  killing  16  and  injuring  20.  Al-Qaeda  later  claims  responsibility  for  the   attack.   KIEV  —  About  50  youths  attack  the  central  synagogue  in  Ukraine’s  capital,  beating  three  people,  hurling  bottles  and  breaking  windows.  The  mob  marches  down  Kiev’s  main  boulevard,  shouting  “Kill  the  Jews!”  “1  call  this  act  a  pogrom,”  says  the  head  of  Kiev’s  yeshiva,  Rabbi  Tzvi  Kaplan.  “It’s  a  miracle  that  it  was  not  worse.”  WASHINGTON  —  More  than  100,000  Israel  supporters  from  across  North  America  gather  to  express  solidarity  with  the  Jewish  State.  Speakers  include  former  Israeli  prime  minister  Binyamin  Netanyahu,  Nobel  laureate  Elie  Wiesel  and  US  Deputy  Secretary  of  Defence  Paul  Wolfowitz  —  who  draws  some  boos  from  the  crowd  when  he  notes  that  many  Palestinians  also  are  suffering.   PARIS  —  A  far-right  politician,  Jean  Marie  Le  Pen,  stages  a  huge  upset  in  the  first  round  of  France’s  presidential  election,  coming  in  second  behind  President  Jacques  Chirac.  Le  Pen  beats  out  Prime  Minister  Lionel  Jospin,  the  Socialist  Party  candidate,  but  ultimately  loses  in  the  run-off  with  Chirac.   PARIS  —  The  European  Jewish  Congress  counts  some  360  antisemitic  incidents  in  France  during  the  first  three  weeks  of  April.  According  to  France’s  Interior  Ministry,  60  per  cent  of  the  incidents  are  verbal  assaults  and  graffiti,  but  there  also  are  a  dozen  attempts  to  set  fire  to  synagogues  or  damage  graves.  The  number  of  incidents   prompts  some  American  Jewish  leaders  to  call  for  a  boycott  of  France,  but  French  Jewish  leaders  object.   May  2002   NEW  YORK  —  A  CBSt-New  York  Times   poll  finds  that  48  per  cent  of  Americans  support  US  intervention  in  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict,  while  43  per  cent  oppose  it.  Sixty  per  cent  of  Americans  approve  of  President  Bush’s  handling  of  the  conflict,  according  to  the  poll,  which  has  a  three  per  cent  margin  of  error.   June  2002   WASHINGTON  —  In  a  much   anticipated  speech  outlining  US  policy  in  the  Middle  East,  President  Bush  calls  for  a  “new  and  different  Palestinian  leadership”  before  a  Palestinian  state  can  be  created.  Bush  says  the  United  States  will  back  Palestinian  statehood  after  the  Palestinians  “have  new  leaders  and  institutions”.   JERUSALEM  —  The  International  Criminal  Court  in  The  Hague  comes  into  force,  drawing  concern  from  Israeli  officials  and  protests  from  the  United  States  Government.  The  court  has  the  ability  to  indict  individuals  for  genocide,  crimes  against  humanity,  war  and  aggression.  Israel’s  anxiety  stems  from  the  increasing  use  of  international  institutions  to  bash  the  Jewish  State.  The  United  States  withholds  support  for  the  court  over  concern  that  US  peacekeeping  forces  around  the  world  could  become  targets  in  politically   motivated  cases.   LOS  ANGELES  —  An  Egyptian  man  kills  two  Israelis  at  an  El  A1  counter  on  July  4  at  Los  Angeles  International  Airport,  and  is  shot  dead  by  the  airline’s  security  personnel.  Israeli  officials  call  the  shooting  a  terrorist  attack,  but  US  authorities  say  they  can’t  link  Hesham  Mohamed  Hayadet,  who  had  lived  in  the  United  States  for  10  years,  to  any  terrorist  organisation.

"  Angie  Fox   HE  may  be  the  master  of  self-dep  recating  humour,  but  Danny  Katz  can’t  take  the  credit  for  coining  the  title  of  his  new  book,  Dork  geek   Jew.   That  description,  which  Katz  says  couldn’t  be  more  apt,  came  from  hate  mail  he  received  in  response  to  one  of  his  weekly  columns  in  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald’s  Good  Weekend  magazine.   “It  is  what  I  am  and  I  wear  it  as  a   badge  of  honour.   “I  am  a  dork  geek  Jew.  That  is  my  personality,”  he  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  this  week.   But  rather  than  shy  away  from  the  racist  diatribe  which  initially  made  him  “sick  in  the  stomach”,  Katz,  39,  chose  to  confront  his  detractor  armed  with  his  strongest  weapon  —  humour.   A  column  he  wrote  in  response,  titled  “Yiddish”,  was  also  the  inspi  ration  behind  Dork  Geek  Jew  —  a  collection  of  77  of  his  popular  arti  cles  published  in  the  SMH  Good   Weekend  and  West  Australian  from  the  last  seven  years.   While  he  describes  his  column  as  a  “break  from  the  heavy  stuff  in  the  newspaper”,  Katz  does  manage  to  ruffle  feathers.   “The  worst  mail  I’ve  received  is  from  the  Jewish  community  and  croquet  players,”  he  says.   “And  Jewish  croquet  players  —  man,  they  want  to  kill  me!”   Take  his  take  on  Pesach,  for  example:  “Jewish  people  have  a  very  special  gene  —  it’s  called  the  take-a-very-ordinary-incident-and   exaggerate-it  in-a-very-ridiculous  way-gene  ...  and  that’s  how  I  think   the  Passover  story  got  written.”   But  he  Unapologetically  uses  his  platform  to  educate  people  about  Judaism,  despite  being  a  non-prac  tising  Jew.   “It  was  always  important  to  me  to  tell  people,  ‘Hey,  I’m  Jewish  and  I’m  just  like  you  in  every  way’.”  It  helps  to  break  down  barriers,  he   adds.   Although  he  doesn’t  deliberate  ly  infuse  his  writing  with  a  Jewish  flavour,  Katz  acknowledges  that  his  Jewish  background  influences   his  work.   “I  wear  it  as  a  badge  of   honour.  I  am  a  dork  geek  Jew.   That  is  my  personality.”   His  Polish  and  Romanian  grand  parents  migrated  to  Canada  before   World  War  II.   At  the  age  of  seven,  he  and  his  family  moved  to  Sydney,  where  his  father,  a  geologist,  took  up  a  post  at  the  University  of  NSW.   He  compares  his  writing  to  Seinfeld  —  he  regards  the  comedi  an  as  one  of  his  inspirations  —  which  has  an  unmistakable  Jewish  quality,  despite  rarely  referring  to   Judaism.   “If  that’s  who  you  are,  then  it  comes  through  in  your  writing,  but  like  Seinfeld  the  humour  is  univer  sal.   “Jewish  humour  has  a  special  quality  —  a  warmness  and  self  deprecation  so  that  nobody  else  is  hurt  but  the  person  telling  the  joke.”   Katz  believes  his  brartid  of  Jewish  humour  originated  in  the  playground  at  Randwick  Boys  High,  where  he  was  bullied  for  being  the  only  Jew  amid  Turkish,  Lebanese,  Greek  and  Asian  youth.  As  a  defence  mechanism,  he  would  tell  jokes  about  himself,  taking  the  power  away  from  his  tormentors.   It  was  also  at  this  “fantastically  multicultural  school”  that  he  learnt  about  racial  and  religious  toler  ance  —  lessons  that  have  charac  terised  his  writing.   “I  love  the  whole  idea  that  we  are  all  just  human  beings.  That,  to  me,  is  number  one  above  my  Jewishness  or  anybody  else’s  faith.  I  am  obsessed  with  getting  that   across.  Whenever  I  write  about  Jewish  things,  my  point  is  always  to  stress  how  alike  we  are  to   everybody,  instead  of  celebrating   our  differences.”   Katz  is  working  on  the  screen  play  of  his  first  novel,  Spit  the  Dummy,  which  he  wrote  while  rais  ing  the  first  of  two  children,  Talia.  He  also  plans  to  write  a  third  instal  ment  of  his  children’s  series,  Little  Lunch,  which  is  illustrated,  like  all  his  work,  by  his  wife,  Mitch  Vane.   Although  his  chatty,  unstruc  tured  writing  appears  to  roll  off  his  tongue,  success  has  not  come  easy,  he  says.  Before  his  columns  hit  the  limelight,  and  after  he  gave  up  gigs  as  a  stand-up  comedian,  he  was  unemployed  for  three  years,  adopting  the  role  of  Mr  Mum.   “To  be  funny  is  bloody  hard   work.”   @  Danny  Katz  writes,  page  18   Danny  Katz:  “For  me  to  be  funny  Is  bloody  hard  work.'

"  Getting  to  grips  with  Jewish  identity   Allon  Lee   CONCERNED  with  identifying  “Jew  ish  characteristics”,  English  author  and  journalist  Linda  Grant  cites  four  prototypes  that  have  played  an  important  role  in  Jewish  societies  throughout  the  millennia.   “At  the  heart  of  being  a  Jew  lies  a  paradox:  what  is  a  Jew?  It’s  impossi  ble  to  know.  Is  it  a  religion?  Well,  I  am  not  a  religious  person.  Is  it  a  race?   “You’ve  got  blonde-haired  Jews,  dark-skinned  Jews.  Jews  don’t  fit  into  any  one  category,”  the  2001  Orange  Prize  for  Literature  winner  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.   In  Australia  recently  to  attend  the  Melbourne  Writers’  Festival,  a  quar  ter-century  estrangement  from  the  Jewish  world  gave  her  a  new  per  spective.   Ms  Grant  identified  four  Jewish  prototypes,  that  have  featured  in  his  tory:  the  mensch,  the  nebbish,  the  shtarker  and  the  schnorrer.   The  mensch  encapsulates  the  very  best  that  Jews  have  to  offer,  combining  great  intelligence  with  moral  uprightness.  The  nebbish  is  often  seen  as  an  intellectual,  funny,  enlightened,  harmless,  cultured,  an  entertainer  but  also  “someone  you  feel  sorry  for”.   The  shtarker  or  “strongman”  is  a  type  that  makes  non-Jews  feel  uncomfortable.  “Jewish  history  has  always  had  their  strongmen  from  Samson  to  Sharon,""  she  says.   The  fourth  prototype  is  the  quick  ly  fading  schnorrer,  “the  guy  who  lives  dn  his  wits”;  a  character  that  Ms  Grant  says  has  been  relegated  to   history  since  the  Holocaust  ended  and  Israel  was  established,  “a  type  of  Jewish  persona  that  non-Jews  both  reviled  and  pitied”.   Her  own  father  found  the  shtark  er  fascinating,  particularly  the  Amer  ican  Jewish  gangsters  of  the  1930s  and  1940s,  but  they  failed  to  create  a  lasting  legacy  because  they  did  not   establish  crime  families.   “The  Israeli  Army  took  over  the  image  of  the  strongman  with  guns  and  made  it  ‘respectable’  by  chan  nelling  it  into  idealism,”  she  says.   “At  the  heart  of  being  a   Jew  lies  a  paradox:  what  is  a  Jew?  It’s   impossible  to  know.”   The  problems  Jews  have  had  in  presenting  .themselves  to  the  world  had  been  partly  of  their  own  making,'  she  explains.  “[We  claim  to  be]  a  people  that  is  different,  set  apart.”   She  quickly  added  that  this  should  not  be  interpreted  as  an  excuse  for  antisemitism,  but  rather  an  added  layer  of  the  Jewish  peo  ple’s  complexity.   Israel  encapsulates  all  the  expres  sions  of  Jewishness,  in  contrast  to  that  of  the  Diaspora,  she  says.   “If  you  go  to  the  Carmel  Market  in  Tel  Aviv,  it  confounds  every  expecta  tion  of  what  you  expect  a  Jew  to  be.   “So  you  find  scientists  rubbing  shoulders  with  prostitutes  and  drug  dealers  mingling  with  Holocaust  sur  vivors.  If  you  grow  up  in  Britain  the  Jewish  identities  are  narrower.”   The  grandchild  of  Russian-Polish  immigrants,  Ms  Grant’s  paternal  grandfather  ended  up  in  England  at  the  start  of  the  20th  century  after  buying  a  ticket  that  he  mistakenly  thought  would  take  him  to  America.  For  the  first  few  days  he  wandered  around  Liverpool  saying  “isn’t  New  York  wonderful”?   “Jews  are  loud,  emotive,  expres  sive,  whilst  the  English  are  seen  as  reserved,  rigid  and  disinterested  in  foreign  cultures,”  she  explains.   “It  created  for  a  powerful  tension  and  ambiguity  when  you  are  a  teenager  that  you  can’t  fit  in  to  this  very  WASPish  culture.  I  didn’t  have  any  cultural  references.”   Describing  herself  as  a  renegade  from  her  Jewish  identity;  she  only  realised  how  important  her  heritage  was  to  her  with  the  onset  of  her  mother’s  dementia,  which  she  wrote  about  in  her  award-winning  book  Remind  Me  Who  /  Am,  Again.   Commissioned  to-  cover  Israel’s  50th-anniversary  celebrations  for  the  Guardian,  Ms  Grant  fell  in  love  with  Tel  Aviv.  The  love  affair  led  her  to  write  When  /  Lived  in  Modem  Times  set  in  Mandatory  Palestine  in  the  1940s,  for  which  she  won  the  Orange  Prize.   Her  latest  novel,  Still  here,  released  in  May  2002,  also  focuses  on  Jewish  characters  but  was  inspired  by  another  romance,  her  love  for  her  hometown  of  Liverpool.   “I  wanted  to  write  a  novel  set  in  the  town  that  gave  the  world  Brian  Epstein,  the  man  who  discovered  the  Beatles,”  she  said.

"  Jewish  students  must  unite   VIEWPOINT   Alex  Ryvchin   DISTURBINGLY,  the  biggest  demonstration  of  anti-Israeli  and  anti-Zionist  sentiment  I  have  witnessed  at  any  school  or  university  took  place  on  Holocaust  Awareness  Week  —  and   this  was  no  coincidence.   The  organisers  of  the  pro-Palestinian  move  •  ment  were  explicitly  equating  Zionism  to   Nazism  and  comparing  the  slaughter  of  six  mil  lion  Jews  to  Israel’s  attempts  to  defend  itself  against  terrorism.  Anti-Israeli  demonstrators  handed  out  articles  and  newspapers  filled  with  lies  and  propaganda.  The  materials  were  rid  dled  with  cartoons  and  articles  talking  of  Israel’s  own  “final  solution”  and  “blitzkrieg”  on   the  Palestinians.   The  presence  of  antisemitism,  anti-Zionism  and  outright  ignorance,  is  nothing  new  —  par  ticularly  in  universities.  However,  the  role  played  by  Jews  themselves  was  most  troubling   of  all.   ■  [  Students  identifying  themselves  as  Jews   openly  supported  the  pro-Palestinian  faction   and  issued  students  with  antisemitic  materi  als.  Furthermore,  Jewish  members  of  the  uni  versity  faculty  have  also  openly  lent  their  sup  port  to  the  Palestinians  and  have  accused  their  own  people  of  barbarism.  They  have  even  suggested  that  suicide  bombing  is  a  rea  sonable  and  expected  consequence  of  the  Israeli  “occupation”.   At  a  time  when  the  Jewish  state  is  being  threatened,  and  the  Jews  of  the  world  are   '  ’  being  subjected  to  antisemitic  attacks  for  no   other  reason  than  their  ethnicity,  many  Australian  Jews  are  attacking  their  own  people  rather  than  showing  solidarity  with  them.  Clearly,  if  Israel  and  the  Jews  of  the  world  are   to  defend  themselves  this  sort  of  divisiveness  and  treachery  cannot  be  tolerated.   Commendably,  many  Jews  from  the  University  of  NSW  and  from  other  universities  and  TAFES,  as  well  as  a  large  number  of  AUJS  members  and  leaders,  actively  voiced  their  outrage  at  the  spectacle  that  took  place.  At  no  point  did  the  Jewish  contingency  resort  to  vio  lence  or  sabotage.  Doing  so  would  have  violat  ed  the  moral  fibre  of  the  Jewish  community  and  would  have  only  incited  further  anti  semitism.  Many  non-Jewish  students  stood  as  one  with  their  Jewish  counterparts  to  display  their  indignation  at  the  ignorance  that  plagues  the  university.   In  these  times  of  ongoing  conflict  and  strug  gles  for  security,  it  is  the  role  of  Jews  in   Australia  and  the  world  to  unite.  This  must  be  a  time  for  unity  and  solidarity  among  the  Jewish  community.  The  Jews  of  Australia  have   arrived  from  lands  where  antisemitism  was  unimaginably  brutal,  and  any  opposition  to  this  antisemitism  was  simply  not  tolerated.   In  this  democratic  country  however,  we  as  Jews  have  the  opportunity  to  unite  and  fight.  This  is  not  the  time  for  empathy  with  suicide  bombers  and  division  in  our  community.  Only  through  solidarity  and  unity  will  the  Jews  con  tinue  to  defy  those  who  wish  to  see  our  demise.   ■  Alex  Ryvchin  is  a  second  year  Arts/Law  stu  dent  at  University  of  NSW.

"  Restoring  Poland’s  Jewish  cemeteries   Ruth  E  Gruber  reports  on  an  American  man’s  mission  to  restore  some  of  Poland’s   abandoned  cemeteries.   WARSAW  —  For  decades,  the  aban  doned  Jewish  cemetery  in  Karczew,  a  small  town  near  Warsaw  on  the  banks  of  the  Vistula  River,  lan  guished  as  an  eerie  and  disconcert  ing  wasteland.   Dozens  of  tombstones  stood  broken  or  eroded  or  lay  toppled  haphazardly  on  dunes  of  pale  river  sand,  scattered  with  debris  that  included  human  bones  exposed  by   wind  and  rain.   All  that  is  changing  now,  thanks  to  co-operation  between  local  townspeople,  Polish  Jews  and  a  new  volunteer  organisation  aimed  at  cleaning  up  and  restoring  the  hundreds  of  abandoned  Jewish  graveyards  in  Poland.   A  recent  ceremony  marked  the  completion  of  the  first  stage  of  restoration.  “There  are  new  walls  and  a  metal  gate,""  said  Norman  Weinberg,  executive  co-ordinator  of  the  new  Poland  Jewish  Cemetery  Restoration  Project  (PJCRP).  “Dogs  can  no  longer  enter  here  and  chew  on  the  bones.”   The  abandoned  Jewish  cemetery  In  Karczew,  Poland.   Photo:  Ruth  t  uruDer/JiA   The  next  stage  will  involve  plant  ing  trees  and  shrubs  to  stabilise  the  sand,  he  said.  Weinberg,  a  retired  research  chemist  who  lives  near  Buffalo,  established  the  project  in  June  after  successfully  organising  the  restoration  of  the  Jewish  ceme  tery  in  Ozarow,  the  small  Polish  town  where  his  parents  were  born.   The  organisation  aims  to  restore  as  many  as  possible  of  Poland’s  devastated  Jewish  cemeteries;  doc  ument  the  restoration  process   through  words,  pictures  and  video;  translate  the  inscriptions  on  all  the  monuments;  and  put  all  the  materi  al  on  the  internet,  Weinberg  told  JTA  in  an  email  interview.   “We  want  to  build  awareness   and  show  others  how  cemetery  restoration  can  be  done,”  he  said.  “Realistically,  of  course,  we  will  do  this  one  [cemetery]  at  a  time  as  funds  become  available.”   There  are  more  than  1000  Jewish  cemeteries  in  Poland,  most  of  them  abandoned,  overgrown  and  often  devastated.  Many,  ravaged  by  the  Nazis,  were  confiscated  under  com   munism.   They  all  are  expected  to  be  given  back  to  the  Polish  Jewish  communi  ty  under  Poland’s  restitution  law,  as  was  the  cemetery  in  Karczew.  But  Poland’s  Jews  do  not  have  the  financial  resources  to  restore  or  maintain  them.   That’s  where  the  restoration   project  comes  in.  “The  PJCRP  can  advise,  raise  some  funds,  gain  support  from  governments  and  organisations,”  Weinberg  said.   “Restoration  of  the  Jewish  ceme  teries  of  Poland  is  about  remember  ing  and  honouring  the  dead  and  the  many  hundreds  of  thousands  mur  dered  and  buried  in  mass  graves  in  many  of  the  cemeteries  and  in  near  by  forests,”  Weinberg  said.   But,  he  added:  “It  is  also  about  life  and  living,  about  doing  mitzvot  and  about  reconciliation  of  Poles  and  Jews.”   M  For  more  information,  see  the  websites  www.pjcrp.org/index.html  and  www.  ozarow.  org  JTA ",2002-11-08
"  Census  shows  growing  Jewish  population   Bernard  Freedman   AUSTRALIA’S  Jewish  population  is  now  83,993,  according  to  the  first  figures  from  the  2001   Census  released  this  week.   However,  the  actual  Jewish  community  is  believed  to  number  about  105,000,  as  a  signifi  cant  number  of  community  members  tradi  tionally  decline  to  answer  the  voluntary  question  on  religion  on  the  Census  form  —  the  only  one  which  people  may  decline  to  answer.   The  official  figure  is  an  increase  of  4188  on  the  1996  Census,  when  79,805  Jews  revealed  their  religion,  and  9607  more  than  in  1991,  when  74,386  Jewish  people  responded  to  the  religion  question.   The  proportion  of  males  to  females  in  the  Jewish  population  has  remained  much  the  same:  43,604  females  in  2001,  compared  with   40,389  males.   But  while  the  Census  indicates  more  Jews  than  in  previous  years,  Jews  represent  no  more  than  0.44  percent  of  Australia’s  popula  tion,  which  totals  18,972,350,  according  to  2001  data  (the  current  figure  is  about  19.3  million).   This  compares  with  1.9  per  cent  for  Bud  dhists  (population  357,813),  1.5  per  cent  for  Muslims  (population  281,578)  and  0.5  per  cent  for  Hindus  (population  95,473).   In  the  past  decade  Australia’s  Muslim  pop  ulation  has  doubled,  as  has  the  Buddhist  pop   ulation.   Jewish  leaders  have  for  years  urged  mem   bers  of  the  community  to  reveal  their  religion  on  the  Census,  but  many  have  declined,  often  out  of  fear  or  as  a  legacy  of  the  Holocaust.   The  latest  report  reveals  that  Jewish  people  are  not  alone  in  ignoring  the  religion  question.  In  2001  a  quarter  of  the  population  stated  they  had  no  religion  (almost  three  million)  or  chose  not  to  answer  (1.8  million).   Neither  Yiddish  nor  Hebrew  feature  among  the  languages  listed  on  the  Census  as  spoken  at  home,  although  209,372  people  speak  Ara  bic  (including  Lebanese).  More  than  400,000  people  speak  Cantonese,  Mandarin  and  other  Chinese  languages  at  home.   Editorial:  Lessons  from  the  second   generation,  page  16 ",2002-06-21
"  Hobart  excavations  unearth  Jewish  graves   THE  mitzvah  of  visiting  the  dead  has  taken  on  new  meaning  for  Hobart  Hebrew  Congregation   member  David  Clark.   “It’s  a  thought-provoking  thing  when  you’re  driving  along  with  the  remains  of  six  Jewish  people  in  the  back  of  your  car,”  he  told  the  Aus   tralian  Jewish  News.   Over  the  past  month,  Mr  Clark  has  been  helping  to  relocate  bodies  from  a  disused  Jew  ish  cemetery  in  Hobart  to  the  Jewish  section  of  the  general  cemetery.   His  involvement  has  occurred  as  a  result  of  the  excavation  of  a  neglected  Jewish  cemetery  that  has  become  part  of  a  Tasmanian  Govem  ment-approved  $7.5  million  land  redevelop  ment  project.   The  scheme  is  being  undertaken  in  consul  tation  with  the  Tasmanian  Jewish  community,  with  halachic  considerations  being  taken  into   account.   The  site  served  as  a  Jewish  burial  ground  from  the  mid-1800s  until  1877.  In  1950  the  Tas  manian  Housing  Department  built  public  hous  ing  on  adjacent  land,  encroaching  on  several  of  the  burial  plots.  Some  Jewish  graves  were  excavated  without  the  community  being  noti  fied,  and  relocated  to  the  Jewish  section  of  another  cemetery,  at  Cornelian  Bay.   “This  time  they’ve  done  the  right  thing,  but  in  the  1950s  we  should  have  tried  to  have  the  whole  cemetery  preserved,”  Mr  Clark  said.  “There  was  no  attempt  by  the  Jewish  commu  nity  or  anybody  to  save  the  cemetery  back   then.”   The  State  Government  has  agreed  to  help  cover  the  costs  associated  with  the  reburials,  and  will  allow  Jewish  observers  to  be  present  during  the  excavations.   It  is  using  specialist  excavation  machinery,  as  well  as  the  services  of  an  archaeologist  and   David  Clark  holds  records  relating  to  the  graveyard  uncovered  at  Windsor  Court.   Photo:  Hobart  Mercury   surveyor  to  ensure  that  the  graves  remain  intact  during  the  relocation.   Jewish  law  dictates  that  bodies  should  be   kept  intact  as  far  as  possible  because  of  the  belief  in  resurrection  of  the  dead,  as  well  as  the  principle  of  honouring  the  dead.   “Most  of  the  bodies  are  150  years  old,”  Mr  Clark  said.  “Most  of  the  [remaining]  relatives  are  fairly  distant.  It’s  not  people  we  know,  but  we  feel  the  kinship,  as  Jews.  No-one  in  the  com  munity  has  been  deeply  upset  about  what  has  happened  because  the  government  has  tried  to  do  the  right  thing.”   Hobart  Hebrew  Congregation  president  Caroline  Heard  said  that  the  State  Government  had  handled  the  situation  in  both  a  “sensitive  and  sensible”  manner.   “It’s  a  great  pity  that  in  years  gone  by  that   the  same  degree  of  regard  for  this  wasn’t  evi  dent  because  there  are  a  lot  of  gaps  with  regard  to  what  historical  evidence  is  available   ...  but  all  the  relevant  authorities  ...  have  been  extremely  helpful.”   Melbourne  Chevra  Kadisha  executive  direc  tor  Ephraim  Finch  said  the  organisation  was  assisting  the  Tasmanian  community.   Project  consultant  Paul  Gray  said  that  a  set  of  protocols  guiding  the  grave  excavations  was  established  prior  to  work  commencing.   Forty-one  bodies  have  been  removed  to  date.  He  said  that  Housing  Tasmania  has  agreed  to  cover  the  reburial  costs,  and  to  pay  for  the  research  of  a  written  history  of  the  for  mer  Jewish  cemetery.   Hobart  is  home  to  some  125  Jews  and  the  oldest  existing  shul  in  Australia. ",2002-03-01
"  Christian-Jewish  dialogue  —  agreeing  to  disagree   CHRISTIAN-Jewish  dialogue  has  a  long  way  to  go,  Jewish  speakers  told  a  Jewish  Free  University  forum  at  North  Shore  Synagogue.   On  the  other  hand,  Christian  speakers  emphasised  that  great  progress  has  been  made,  with  mutual  respect  growing  between  the  two   faiths.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  for  mer  president  Peter  Wertheim  expressed  concern  that  actions  of  the  Church  in  the  20th  century  had  undermined  efforts  towards  dialogue.   Citing  the  beatification  of  Edith  Stein  and  the  establishment  of  a  church  and  planting  of  crosses  at  Auschwitz,  he  said  “Edith  Stein  went  to  her  death  as  a  Jew.  There  is  some  thing  perverse  in  seeing  her  death  as  Christian  martyrdom.”   He  noted  that  the  doctrine  of  Jewish  guilt  for  the  death  of  Jesus  still  pervades  some  churches,  and  some  Baptist  churches  still  target  Jews  for   conversion.   Claims  of  progress  in  the  dialogue  process  may  be  premature,  he  cau  tioned.  “Dialogue  still  has  a  long  way  to  go.”   Peta  Jones  Pellach,  Director  of  Adult  Education  for  The  Shalom  Institute,  condemned  the  Christian  churches  for  failing  to  respond  to  attacks  on  Israel,  insisting  that  most  attacks  target  Jews,  rather  than  any  political  issue.   The  Pope  had  failed  to  respond  to   Paul  O’Shea,  Aleck  Goldheig,  Peter  Wertheim,  Peta  Jones  Pellach,  Sister  Trish  Madigan,  Rabbi  David  Freedman.   Syrian  President  Bashir  Assad’s  bla  tant  antisemitism  and  continued  to  welcome  him  in  the  Vatican,  while  church  groups  have  been  silent  on  Yasser  Arafat’s  claim  that  the  Temple  never  stood  in  Jerusalem,  she  said.   “When  Judaism  is  attacked,  the  religion  of  Jesus  is  attacked.  When  Arafat  told  a  London  newspaper  that  the  Temple  had  never  been  in  Jerusalem,  where  was  the  Christian  outcry?   “Christianity  is  based  on  the  story  of  Jesus  as  a  Jew  in  Jerusalem.  The  beginning  of  the  Christian-Jewish  diar  logue  ought  to  be  our  common  her  itage:  Jesus  living  as  a  Jew.  If  that  is   taken  away  by  historical  revisionism,  given  tacit  approval  by  the  European  enemies  of  Israel,  the  foundation  for  discussion  is  shaken,  perhaps  removed.”   Sister  Trish  Madigan  and  Paul  O’Shea,  practising  Catholics  engaged  in  dialogue  with  the  Jewish  communi  ty,  both  suggested  that  great  progress  had  been  made  within  Christianity  to  understand  the  princi  ples  of  interfaith  dialogue.  Christianity  no  longer  saw  its  mission  as  proselytising  to  the  entire  world,  particularly  to  Jews,  they  said.   A  spirit  of  mutual  respect  had  emerged  within  which  there  is  room   for  discussion  about  matters  oi  iaiui.   They  reminded  the  audience  that  official  Church  policy  was  not  to  con  demn  Jews  for  the  death  of  Jesus,  which  opened  the  door  to  discussion  about  the  common  roots  of  Judaism  and  Christianity.   Sister  Madigan  —  a  participant  in  the  Women’s  Interfaith  Network  and  the  Australian  National  Dialogue  of  Christian,  Muslims  and  Jews  —  con  ceded  that  while  significant  theologi  cal  issues  would  always  remain  unresolved  between  the  two  faith  groups,  many  matters  of  mutual  inter  est  could  be  tackled  jointly,  including  the  pursuit  of  world  peace  and  con  cern  for  the  oppressed.   She  defined  “dialogue”  as  a  forum  for  the  genuine  sharing  of  ideas,  where  listening  is  more  important  than  speaking.   Mr  O’Shea  described  moments  of  true  dialogue  where  Jews  and  Christians  had  come  together  in  an  atmosphere  of  respect,  each  group  confident  in  its  own  faith  and  accept  ing  of  the  other.   Expressing  optimism  in  the  dia  logue  process,  he  emphasised  that  the  Christian  Church  is  not  monolith  ic,  but  is  divided  about  the  role  of  dia  logue.   Catholic  Church  policy  is  to  pro  mote  reconciliation  between  Christians  and  Jews,  and  Catholics  abhor  the  activities  of  some  Christians  who  regard  dialogue  as  an   uppui  lunity  L[Jciouauc  JCW5  Uie   error  of  their  ways”.   Similarly,  some  Jews  see  dialogue  as  simply  a  venue  to  air  grievances,  rather  than  an  opportunity  to  seek  common  ground.  This,  too,  is  unhelp  ful  in  forging  mutual  respect.   On  the  other  hand,  an  atmosphere  of  dialogue  should  permit  honesty  —  including  the  expression  of  concerns.   ""The  doctrine  of  Jewish  guilt  for  the  death  of  Jesus  still  pervades  some  churches,   and  some  Baptist  churches   still  target  Jews  for   conversion.""   The  audience  included  a  number  of  Christians  who  defended  their  churches  and  described  their  experi  ence  of  dialogue.   A  former  executive  director  of  the  South  African  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  Aleck  Goldberg,  spoke  of   reconciliation  efforts  between  Jews  and  Christians  in  the  old  and  new  South  Africa.   Saying  race  was  a  more  important  issue  than  religion  in  South  Africa,  he  described  the  process  as  “climbing  Jacob’s  ladder—one  rung  at  a  time”.   Kehillat  Masada  Rabbi  David  Freedman  chaired  the  discussion. ",2002-11-29
"  Controversy  over  satire   A  CONTROVERSIAL  animated  film  satirising  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  has  been  defended  by  its  producer  at  the  Edinburgh  International  Rim  Festival.

"  Jewish  revival   in  New  Zealand   Aiana  Rosenbaum   IMMIGRATION  from  South  Africa  has  injected  new  life  into  New  Zealand’s  Jewish  population.   The  2001  New  Zealand  Census  has  revealed  marked  Jewish  growth,  which  communal  leaders  attribute  to  young  families  from  South  Africa,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  Israel.   The  2001  Census  put  New  Zealand’s  Jewish  population  at  7296  —  a  rise  of  65  per  cent  over  1996,  when  the  community  numbered  4809.  The  current  figure  is  thought  to  be  the  highest  ever  listed  in  the  Land  of  the  Long  White  Cloud.   The  Jewish  population  is  concentrated  in  the  largest  city,  Auckland,  whose  Jewish  community  was  founded  in  1840.  It  has  two  shuls,  one  Orthodox  and  one  Progressive,  as  well  as  a  Jewish  dayschool,  Kadimah  College.   The  once-vibrant  community  of  Wellington,  the  nation’s  capital,  has  dwindled  to  1200.  Wellington  is  also  home  to  an  Orthodox  and  a  Progressive  shul,  as  well  as  a  Jewish  dayschool  comprising  50  pupils.   The  Jewish  population  of  Canterbury  on  South  Island  is  650.   Auckland’s  Jewish  expansion  is  such  that  the  Auckland  Hebrew  Congregation  and  Kadimah  College  have  outgrown  their  premises.  They  are  due  to  move  to  a  new  campus.   Auckland  Hebrew  Congregation  president  David  Nathan,  whose  great-great-grandfather  founded  the  shul  in  1840,  has  seen  the  Jewish  community  swell  since  the  1980s.   “Auckland’s  community  is  vibrant  and  active.  We  have  just  had  Purim  in  the  park  and  Chanukah  in  the  square.  At  shul  there  are  always   simchas:  brit  milahs,  weddings.  For  the  first  time  we  have  competing  simchas.  We  are  flat  out.”   New  Zealand  —  a  country  which  has  had  a  Jewish  Prime  Minister  (Sir  Julius  Vogel,  in  the  19th  century)  and  five  Jewish  mayors  —  is  an  ideal  setting,  Mr  Nathan  said.   “You  don’t  have  a  problem  with  antisemitism.  There  is  a  good  feeling  towards  Jews.”   A  kosher  store  in  Auckland  imports  meat  from  Australia.  “It  is  not  hard  to  be  kosher.  There  have  been  huge  strides.”   New  Zealand  Jewish  Chronicle  editor  Mike  Regan  agreed  that  Auckland  has  enjoyed  a  Jewish  revival,  but  said  the  community  is  still  beset  by  migration  to  Australia.   Young  people  have  “left  in  droves”,  largely  in  pursuit  of  Jewish  partners.  If  you  wanted  a  Jewish  partner,  the  chances  of  finding  one  in  New  Zealand  were  slim.  When  I  was  in  Habonim  in  the  ’60s,  people  talked  about  finding  a  Jewish  partner  in  Australia.”   But  the  population  is  being  replenished  by  South  Africans,  he  said.  “I  was  invited  to  a  13th  birthday  at  Kadimah  College.  I  was  amazed  by  the  predominance  of  the   South  African  accent.”   Kadimah  College  has  240  students,  of  whom  25  per  cent  are  of  South  African  descent.   Kadimah  acting  principal  Sue   Nevezie  said  enrolments  have  increased  by  about  50  students  since  1993,  and  the  school  looks  set  to  undergo  further  growth.   Each  week,  the  college  receives  up  to  four  overseas  inquiries  from  countries  that  include  South  Africa,  Israel  and  Argentina. ",2002-03-22
"  Fears  of  Jewish  underground  rise   Gil  Sedan   JERUSALEM  —  Almost  20  years  after  Israel  was  shaken  by  the  exposure  of  a  Jewish  underground  in  the  West  Bank,  some  fear  that  another  one  could  be  emerging.   In  the  past  few  days,  police  detained  four  Jews  from  settlements  in  the  Hebron  Hills  region.  They  were  suspected  of  conspiring  to  plant  a  booby-trapped  cart  in  a  Palestinian  girls  school  in  Jerusalem.   On  Monday,  police  arrested  a  fifth  suspect,  Noam  Federman,  in  connection  with  the  alleged  plot.  Federman  is  a  widely  known  anti  Arab  activist.  If  the  incident  does  prove  to  be  part  of  a  larger  move  ment,  it  could  complicate  a  tentative  opening  toward  peace-making,  and  undercut  public  support  for  the   embattled  settlement  movement.   The  first  Jewish  underground  was  exposed  as  a  result  of  thorough  intel   ligence  work  by  the  General  Security  Service  inside  the  “hard  core”  of  the  Jewish  settlement  movement  in  the  West  Bank.   In  contrast,  the  latest  alleged  plot  was  detected  by  chance,  when  police  came  upon  a  vehicle  they  thought  was  acting  strangely.  Security  forces  reportedly  had  no  prior  knowledge  of  any  Jewish  ter  rorist  plot.   Several  days  ago,  a  regular  police  patrol  spotted  a  van,  of  a  type  fre  quently  used  by  the  settlers  as  secu  rity  vehicles,  stopping  near  the  Palestinian  Al-Mukassid  Hospital.   The  passengers  tried  to  detach  from  the  car  a  cart  laden  with  explo  sives.  It  reportedly  was  set  to  explode  at  7.35am,  when  the  street  would  be  humming  with  girls  on  their  way  to  a  nearby  school.   Police  detained  Shlomo  Dvir   (Seliger),  27,  of  the  Bat  Ayin  Bet  set  tlement  in  the  Hebron  Hills;  Yarden   Morag,  25,  of  Bat  Ayin;  Ofer  Gamliel,  42,  also  of  Bat  Ayin;  and  Yosef  Ben  Baruch,  23,  of  the  Maon  Farm,  also  near  Hebron.   The  four  are  suspected  of  plotting  to  carry  out  a  terrorist  attack.  The  suspects  denied  the  charges,  and  said  they  were  framed  and  tortured  by  their  investigators.   “There  are  increasing  signs  of   renewed  Jewish  vigilantism   in  the  West  Bank.""   A  Jerusalem  court  extended  their  remand.  It  was  the  first  time  since   the  intifada  began  in  September  2000  that  security  forces  have  laid  their  hands  on  Jews  suspected  of  plotting  terror  attacks  against  Palestinians.   Had  the  incident  occurred  in  a   vacuum,  it  might  have  been  over  looked  as  a  marginal  event.  However,  there  are  increasing  signs  of  renewed  Jewish  vigilantism  in  the  West  Bank.   Eight  Palestinian  school  students  and  a  school  attendant  were  wound  ed  last  March  in  an  explosion  in  the  eastern  Jerusalem  neighbourhood  of  Sur  Baher.  An  unknown  organisation  calling  itself  “The  Revenge  of  the  Infants”  claimed  responsibility  for  the  attack,  apparently  in  revenge  for   a  Palestinian  terrorist  attack  in  the  fervently  Orthodox  Beit  Yisrael  neighbourhood  of  Jerusalem.   Seven  Palestinians  have  been  killed  in  suspected  terror  attacks  against  Palestinians  in  the  past  two  years,  and  10  have  been  wounded.   None  of  those  cases  has  been  cracked,  but  police  now  are  check  ing  whether  the  four  settlers  from  the  Hebron  region  are  associated   with  the  previous  attacks.

"  Feature   Solly  Gerber  has  visited  192  of  the  world’s  193  countries.  He  recently  returned  from   Afghanistan,  where  he  met  the  country’s  last  practising  Jew.  This  is  his  report.   An  encounter  with  the   LAST  JEW   m  Afghanistan   ’E  are  familiar  with  the  war  in   Afghanistan.  A  lesser-known  ¥  ¥  fact  is  that  a  Jewish  commu  nity  complex  still  exists  in  Kabul,  housing  the  country’s  last  two  known  Jews,  one  of  whom  is  still  practising.   Having  travelled  to  191  of  the  193  countries  in  the  world,  except  for  Afghanistan  and  Iraq,  and  with  an  interest  in  finding  Jewish  communi  ties  in  remote  places,  I  decided  to  go  in  search  of  the  last  Jews  of  Afghanistan.   The  flight  to  Kabul  from  Dubai  on  the  only  aircraft,  a  Boeing  727,  owned  by  the  restarted  Ariana  airline,  was  a  pleasant  surprise.  The  interior  was  in  good  condition  and  the  service  excel  lent.  Even  though  the  crew  were  local  Afghans,  they  spoke  relatively  good  English.  The  passengers  were  mainly  Afghan,  with  10  Americans  who  had  left  Afghanistan  20  years  ago  and  were  returning  to  visit  relatives.   Although  the  arrival  formalities  were  disorganised,  I  secured  a  visa,  emerged  from  the  airport  and  was  approached  by  a  well-dressed  man  who  introduced  himself  as  Latif  and  offered  to  be  my  guide.   I  knew  there  had  been  a  synagogue  on  Torbazyn  Street.  It  did  not  take  us  long  to  get  there.  It  was  a  street  lined  with  shops  selling  clothes,  handicrafts  and  jewellery—the  shopping  centre  of  Kabul.  It  was  also  the  only  street  with  English  names  signposted.  It  intersected  a  main  thoroughfare;  one  side  was  Chicken  Street,  the  other  Flower  Street.   The  task  was  to  find  the  syna   gogue.  Latif  sought  assistance  from  shopkeepers  and  pedestrians.  No  one  knew  of  a  “synagoga”.  I  was  about  to  give  up  hope  when  one  of  the  shopkeepers  directed  us  to  a  gen  tleman  relaxing  on  a  chair  on  the  pavement.  Latif  approached.  I  was  expecting  another  exercise  in  futility,  when  the  man  invited  us  into  a  nearby  building.   Once  inside,  he  immediately  locked  the  door  which  led  to  the  street.  The  complex  had  a  ground  floor  and  upper  floor.  He  led  us  upstairs.  The  only  furniture  in  the  room  was  a  table  and  chairs.  In  the  other  comer  were  blankets.   On  a  wall  was  a  blackboard  with  the  name  Zebulon  Simanto  written  in   chalk  in  childish  letters.  He  put  on  a  skullcap.   I  realised  that  I  had  found  possi  bly  the  last  Jew  in  Kabul.  Zebulon  couldn’t  speak  English,  so  we  com  municated  through  Latif.  Because  of  this,  I  felt  constrained  to  ask  ques  tions  which  I  considered  sensitive  and  might  jeopardise  his  safety.   Zebulon  and  Latif  spoke  freely,  and  I  realised  that  Latif  found  the  rev  elation  of  finding  a  “Jehuda”  and  “syn  agoga”  just  as  fascinating  as  I  did.   Zebulon  brought  out  a  platter  of  nuts  and  bottle  of  mineral  water,  which  we  shared.  He  was  aware  that  I  was  Jewish  and  pointed  out  a  few  worn  Siddurim  and  tallitot.   Zebulon  considers  himself  the  last  Jew  in  Afghanistan  and  feels  it  is  his  duty  to  look  after  the  synagogue  complex.  He  told  me  that  the  only  other  person  living  in  the  complex  was  a  Mr  Levi,  who  occupied  a  room  on  the  ground  floor.  Zebulon  permit  ted  him  to  stay  because  he  was  eld  erly  and  had  no  other  place  to  live.  However,  he  and  Mr  Levi  were  not  on  speaking  terms  because  Mr  Levi  had  forsaken  Judaism,  had  become  a  Muslim,  was  a  “bad  man”  and  had  informed  the  Taliban  that  Zebulon  was  a  spy.  This  had  resulted  in  Zebu  lon  being  imprisoned  for  six  months  and  being  beaten  by  the  Taliban.  I   did  not  meet  Mr  Levi.   Zebulon  said  he  was  42  and  has  two  daughters  and  a  wife  living  in  Israel.  I  got  the  impression  that  he  had  visited  Israel,  although  I  declined  to  ask  why  he  did  not  emi  grate  there.   He  had  been  in  the  textile  busi  ness,  but  was  not  working  at  pres  ent.  He  said  that  at  its  peak,  Kabul  had  100  Jewish  families  and  the  city  of  Herat,  which  is  close  to  Iran,  400  families.  The  complex  had  once  been  the  Kabul  Jewish  community  complex,  comprising  two  syna  gogues,  classrooms,  a  mikvah  and  kosher  slaughtering  facilities.  Herat  had  had  two  synagogues,  both  of  which  had  been  destroyed;  there  were  no  Jews  left.   Having  exhausted  the  limits  of  our  conversation,  Zebulon  proceed  ed  to  show  me  the  complex.  The  room  in  which  we  stood  was  his  liv  ing  quarters.  It  was  there  that  he  spent  most  of  his  time  during  the   Ingrained  Stars  of  David  on  the  outside  wall  of  the  Kabul  synagogue.

In  previous  times  it  served  as  a  classroom.  He  then  unlocked  a  door  which  led  into  a  synagogue.  It  was  bare  except  for  a  bimah,  and  an  ark  on  the  eastern  wall.  Surrounding  the  bimah  was  ornate  metalwork  with  a  pattern  of  Magen  Davids.  The  walls  were  plas  tered  with  marble  tablets  engraved  with  Hebrew  lettering.  The  ark  was  bare,  except  for  a  few  prayer  books,  a  tom  poster  with  Hebrew  writing  and  a  shofar  with  decorations  deli  cately  carved.  The  only  Torah  had  been  confiscated  by  the  Taliban.   Zebulon  then  unlocked  the  door  to  the  second  synagogue.  It  too  was  bare,  except  for  an  ark  which  con  tained  nothing  but  an  engraved  shofar.  The  downstairs  rooms  had  once  been  classrooms  and  function  rooms.  Although  the  complex  is  sadly  neglected,  there  has  been  no  attempt  to  destroy  or  desecrate  it.   Zebulon  then  said  that  as  I  had  a  car  at  my  disposal,  he  would  show  me  the  Jewish  cemetery  on  the  outskirts  of  the  city.  The  cemetery  was  sur  rounded  by  a  high  brick  wall.  Zebulon  unlocked  the  gate.  The  tombstones  had  been  destroyed,  and  it  was  impossible  to  demarcate  the  graves.   Zebulon  said  it  was  fortuitous  that  we  were  there  that  day  as  it  his  mother’s  yahrzeit.  He  recited  Kad  dish  and  we  returned  to  the  complex  on  Flower  Street.   It  was  then  that  I  noticed  that  a   large  section  of  the  plaster  work  on  the  outside  of  the  complex  com  prised  a  pattern  of  small  Magen  Davids;  I  was  intrigued  to  realise  that  the  Jewish  identity  of  the  building  was  easily  noticeable  from  the  street.   I  found  it  remarkable  that,  having  regard  to  the  religious  fanaticism  of  the  Taliban,  there  had  been  no  attempt  to  destroy  the  complex,  or  even  this  obvious  Jewish  symbolism  in  such  a  central  position  in  Kabul.   “They  accept  Zebulon  as  a  fellow  citizen  with  strange   habits,  without  realising  that  he  represents  a  vital  thread   in  the  rich  tapestry  of   Diaspora  Jewish  history.""   That  night  I  found  accommoda  tion  in  a  guesthouse  around  the  cor  ner.  Unexpectedly,  Zebulon  called  and  insisted  that  I  have  dinner  with  him.  I  no  longer  had  the  services  oi  Latif,  so  communication  was  difficult  —  sign  language  and  gestures.   Notwithstanding  my  protesta  tions,  I  could  not  resist  his  overtures  and  accompanied  him  to  the  com  plex  to  find  that  in  his  room,  in  the  dim  light  of  a  small  flame,  the  table  had  been  elaborately  laid  out.  Zebu  Ion  had  prepared  a  hot  meal  ol   braised  chicken  and  an  array  of  veg  etables.  Before  serving  the  meal,  he  repeated  the  word  “kosher”  to   assure  me  that  the  chicken  was  acceptable.  To  convince  me  further,  he  brought  out  the  knife  that  he  had  used  for  the  ritual  slaughter  and  demonstrated  how  he  had  used  it  to  kill  the  chicken.  After  the  meal,  he  bensched.  I  could  never  have  antici   pated  such  a  profound  Jewish  expe  rience  in  Kabul  —  finding  a  man  who  practised  Judaism  to  the  extent  that  he  did.  And  judging  from  the  reaction  of  Latif  and  other  Afghanis,  I  got  the  impression  that  they  accept  Zebulon  as  a  fellow  citizen  with  strange  habits,  without  realising  that  he  rep  resents  a  vital  thread  in  the  rich  tap  estry  of  Diaspora  Jewish  history.   The  next  morning  Zebulon  called  to  bid  me  farewell  as  I  was  leaving  Afghanistan  by  road  over  the  Khyber  Pass.  I  had  made  a  donation  towards  the  upkeep  of  the  complex.  He  pre  sented  me  with  one  of  the  two  sho  fars,  and  despite  my  protestations  refused  to  take  any  compensation  for  it.  I  departed  with  the  shofar  and  with  memories  of  a  unique  experi  ence.  Never  did  I  expect  to  find  the  country’s  last  two  synagogues  and  the  last  practising  Jew  who  wears  a  skullcap  at  home,  bensches  after  meals  and  keeps  kosher.

"  Hate  material  renaissance   SIXTY-FIVE  million  Americans,  including  90  per  cent  of  schoolchildren,  have  internet  access,  according   to  the  latest  census  estimates.   Although  the  Franklin  Prophesy  —  an  antisemit  ic  statement  falsely  attributed  to  Benjamin  Franklin  —  has  existed  for  nearly  70  years,  it  rested  in  rela  tive  obscurity  until  recently.

"  Jewish  female  governor  for  Hawaii?   WASHINGTON  —  As  the  first  Jewish  Republican  woman  running  for  Gov  ernor  of  Hawaii,  Linda  Lingle  finds  herself  attracting  attention  as  Jew  ish,  Republican  and  women’s  groups  all  lend  their  support  for  her  attempt  to  “make  life  better  for  all  the  people  of  Hawaii”.   She  has  some  hurdles  to  over  come:  there  are  only  10,000  Jews  in  Hawaii  out  of  a  population  of  1.2  mil  lion.  Moreover,  Hawaii’s  Jewish  community,  like  the  general  popula  tion,  tends  to  vote  Democratic.   Just  the  same,  when  voters  go  to   the  polls  in  November,  Lingle  hopes  to  become  Hawaii’s  first  Republican  governor  in  40  years.   Running  as  a  moderate  Republi  can,  she  thinks  she  will  relate  well  to  the  Jewish  community  and  to  many  Democrats.  “I  can’t  think  of  anything  we’d  differ  on,”  she  said.   “My  race  has  sort  of  been  adopt  ed,”  she  said.  “There  is  pride  in  hav  ing  me  as  a  Jewish  candidate.”   Lingle’s  says  her  Jewish  heritage  has  helped  her  political  career  in  Hawaii  because  it  has  given  her  a  better  understanding  of  diversity,   which  in  turn  helps  her  connect  with  citizens  of  different  religious  and  ethnic  backgrounds.   Lingle,  49,  is  a  member  of  a  Jew  ish  congregation  on  the  island  of   Maui  and  attends  Lubavitch  servic  es  in  Honolulu  on  Oahu.   She  believes  that  Hawaiians  have   sympathy  for  Israel’s  war  against   Arab  terror  because  of  the  1941  attack  on  Pearl  Harbour.   “I  believe  the  essential  goal  of  US  policy  in  the  Middle  East  should  be  the  preservation  of  a  strong,  safe   and  secure  Israel,  she  said.

"  Attacks  on  German  Jewish  cemeteries   Toby  Axelrod   BERLIN  —  A  spate  of  recent  attacks  on  Jewish  cemeteries  in  Germany   has  authorities  confounded  —  and  Jewish  leaders  mad.   Most  startling  was  a  dynamite  explosion  at  a  cemetery  here  on  Saturday.  Police,  who  announced  an  award  of  nearly  $US5000  for  informa  tion  leading  to  the  arrest  of  the  per  petrators,  said  they  were  seeking   information  about  the  driver  of  a  car  seen  heading  the  wrong  way  on  a  one-way  road  near  the  cemetery  around  the  time  of  the  explosion.   The  attack  took  place  shortly  after  another  incident,  in  which  a  Soviet-era  memorial  in  eastern  Berlin  was  defaced  with  Nazi  graffiti,  including  swastikas.  Police  said   there  was  no  indication  that  the  two  incidents  were  connected.   “Berlin  police  have   reported  106  antisemitic   incidents  in  2001.”   Other  recent  incidents  included  the  vandalism  of  a  Jewish  cemetery  in  the  eastern  German  city  of  Rostock  on  March  8  and  severe  dam   age  to  a  memorial  at  the  former  con  centration  camp  of  W’bbelin,  to  a  Jewish  cemetery  in  Boizenberg  and  to  a  memorial  to  the  death  march  in  Raben  Steinfeld.   For  the  residents  of  Rostock,  the  vandalism  brought  home  an  impor  tant  message:  Some  elements  in  the  society  care  just  as  little  for  the  peace  of  the  dead  as  for  the  peace  of  mind  of  the  living.   “What  can  we  do,  in  order  to  effectively  protect  our  Jewish  citi  zens,  both  the  living  and  dead?”  asked  Fred  Mahlburg,  president  of  the  Rostock  Foundation  for  Jewish   History  and  Culture,  during  a  com  munal  meeting  that  was  reported  in  a  local  newspaper.  “This  is  now  about  the  quality  of  our  democratic  society.”   The  community  is  not  discussing  specific  security  measures,  but  syna  gogues  and  Jewish  cultural  centres  here  have  police  guards,  as  they  do  in  many  European  cities.   Security  has  been  stepped  up  lately,  largely  in  connection  with   Israeli-Palestinian  violence.   Still,  Germany  has  not  seen  the  level  of  antisemitic  rage  that  has  plagued  the  French  Jewish  commu  nity  since  the  Palestinian  intifada  began  18  months  ago.   Berlin  police  have  reported  455  cases  of  right-wing-related  crimes  in  2001,  among  them  106  antisemitic  incidents,  about  twice  as  many  as  in  the  previous  year.   Most  are  so-called  propaganda  crimes,  involving  desecration  of  property  and  use  of  forbidden  Nazi  symbols  and  slogans.   In  the  Berlin  cemetery  explosion,  the  perpetrators  apparently  filled  a  metal  container  with  100  grams  of  dynamite  and  threw  it  over  the  wall  into  the  courtyard  leading  to  the  cemetery.  The  explosion,  which  a  neighbor  said  sounded  like  an  air  plane  crash,  shattered  windows  in  the  small  chapel  and  office  facing  the  courtyard.  There  has  been  no  esti  mate  of  the  cost  of  repairs.   Berlin  Mayor  Klaus  Wowereit  told  reporters  that  he  was  “dismayed”  by  the  “shameful  attack”.   Michel  Friedmann,  vice  president  of  the  Central  Council  of  Jews  in  Germany,  called  the  vandalism  a   “barbaric  act”.   The  president  of  Berlin’s  Jewish  community,  Alexander  Brenner,  blamed  unfair  media  reports  on  the  Mideast  for  creating  a  “superheated  atmosphere”  that  led  to  antisemitic   attacks.

"  Rich  Jewish  history  in  historic  homes   Graham  de  Vahl  Davis   IT  is  not  widely  known,  but  there  are  two  colonial-era  houses  in   Sydney’s  west  with  a  rich  Jewish  history.   The  Homestead,  in  Lionel  Street,  Georges  Hall,  is  the  oldest  building  in  Bankstown,  and  is  where  one  of  Sydney’s  Jewish  convicts  spent  the  last  years  of  her  life.   Esther  Abrahams  was  a  London  milliner  who  in  1786  was  sentenced  to  seven  years’  transportation  for  stealing  24  yards  of  black  silk  lace  with  a  value  of  50  shillings.   Travelling  to  Sydney  on  the  First  Fleet,  she  formed  a  liaison  with  Lieutenant  George  Johnston.  She  went  on  to  live  with  Johnston,  and  they  had  three  sons  and  four  daughters.  Esther  eventually  married  him  on  November  12,1814.   Johnston  became  a  leading  player  in  the  events  of  the  colony.  In  1793  he  obtained  a  grant  of  100  acres  (40  ha)  on  Parramatta  Road,  which  he   named  Annandale  after  his  Scottish  birthplace  of  Annan.   Five  years  later,  he  was  granted  a  further  170  acres  at  Banks’  Town,  on  the  banks  of  Prospect  Creek,  a  property  he  named  George’s  Hall.   Transferring  from  the  marines  to  the  NSW  Corps,  he  led  the  suppression  of  the  revolt  at  Castle  Hill  in  1804,  earning  a  further  60  acres.  As  commanding  officer  of  the  NSW  Corps,  he  led  the  1808  Rum  Rebellion  against  Governor  Bligh,   The  Homestead,  Georges  Hall...  where  Esther  Abrahams  spent  the  last  years  of  her  life.   following  which  he  declared  himself  Lieutenant-Governor  of  the  colony.   Court-martialled  in  England,  he  was  cashiered,  returning  to  NSW  in  1813.  He  died  in  1823,  and  Esther  inherited  what  is  now  the  suburb  of  Annandale  and  part  of  Stanmore.   The  original  house  at  Georges  Hall  was  at  risk  of  flooding,  and  a  new  house,  The  Homestead,  was  built  on  higher  ground  in  1837.  It  is  constructed  of  sandstock  bricks,  with  magnificent  cedar  panelling.   Despite  a  bitter  court  case  between  Esther  and  her  children,  it  is  believed  that  she  spent  her  last   years  with  her   son  David  at  The  Homestead,  where  she  died  on  August  26,  1846.  She  was  buried,  with  George,  at  Annandale,  but  the  family   remains  were   Esther  Abrahams   later  moved  to  Waverley  Cemetery.   The  house  remained  with  the  Johnston  family  until  1917.  It  is  now  owned  by  the  Calvary  Chapel  Church,  which  operates  a  school   there,  and  whicn  unaertooK  extensive  restorations.   Despite  alterations,  much  of  the  original  property  remains.   Collingwood,  near  the  Hume  Highway  at  Congressional  Drive,  is  the  oldest  building  in  Liverpool  and  also  has  strong  Jewish  connections.   It  was  built  by  Captain  Eber  Bunker,  a  Nantucket  whaling  cap  tain  who  moved  to  England  at  the  time  of  the  US  War  of  Independence,  transported  convicts  to  Sydney  in  the  Third  Fleet,  and  settled  here,  starting  a  whaling  industry.   In  about  1810,  he  built  the  house   known  as  Collingwood,  where  he  lived  until  his  death  in  1826.  Coincidentally,  Bunker  played  a  minor  part  in  the  Rum  Rebellion.   In  1835,  Saul  Samuel  arrived  in  the  colony.  He  formed  a  mercantile  company,  and  by  1841,  aged  21,  owned  190,000  acres  on  the  Macquarie  River.   In  1846  he  became  the  first  Jew  to  be  appointed  a  magistrate,  and  became  the  first  Jew  elected  to  the  Legislative  Assembly  and  the  first  to  become  a  Minister  of  the  Crown.   He  laid  the  foundation  stone  of  the  Great  Synagogue,  later  becoming  president.  In  1880-97  he  was  Agent-General  for  NSW  in  London,  where  he  died  in  1900.   Samuel  owned  Collingwood  from  1869  until  his  death.  He  established  a  wool-scouring  factory,  which  contained  a  machine  (for  removing  burrs)  that  he  had  invented.   Collingwood  is  adjacent  to  the  Liverpool  Bicentennial  Museum,  which  contains  a  display  devoted  to  Samuel.   In  the  1850s,  it  became  the  home  of  an  abortive  attempt  to  establish  an  alpaca  industry,  and  later  spent  time  as  a  golf  clubhouse;  it  has  been  restored  by  Liverpool  City  Council  and  is  open  to  the  public.   ■  Graham  de  Vahl  Davis  is  Emeritus  Professor  of  Mechanical  Engineering  at  the  University  of  NSW  and  a  former  president  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies.

"  The  shmooze  on  Friday   Jewish  Bogie   AFTER  months  of  negotiation,  a  Talmudic  scholar  from  Odessa  was  granted  permission  by  the  Czarist  authorities  to  visit  Moscow.  He  boarded  the  train  and  found  an  empty  seat  At  the  next  stop  a  young  man  got  on  and  sat  next  to  him.   The  scholar  looked  at  the   young  man  and  thought:  “This  fellow  doesn’t  look  like  a  peas  ant,  and  if  he  isn’t  a  peasant  he  probably  comes  from  this  dis  trict.  If  he  comes  from-this  dis  trict,  he  must  be  Jewish  because  this  is  the  Jewish  dis  trict,  after  all.   “On  the  other  hand,  if  he  is  a  Jew,  where  could  he  be  going?  Fm  the  only  one  in  our  district  who  has  permission  to  travel  to  Moscow.  Waif  —  just  outside  Moscow  there  is  a  village  called  Samvet,  and  you  don’t  need  special  permission  to  go  there.   “But  why  would  he  be  going  to  Samvet?  He’s  probably  going  to  visit  one  of  the  Jewish  fami  lies  there—but  how  many  Jew  ish  families  are  there  in  Samvet?  Only  two  —  the  Bern  steins  and  the  Steinbergs.  “The  Bernsteins  are  a  terrible  family,  so  he  must  be  visiting  the  Stein  bergs.  But  why?  The  Steinbergs  have  only  girls,  so  maybe  he’s  their  son-in-law.  But  if  he  is,  which  daughter  did  he  marry?  Sarah  married  that  nice  lawyer  from  Budapest  and  Esther  mar   tied  a  businessman  from  Zhadomir;  if  must  be  Sarah’s  husband.   “Which  means  his  name  is  Alexander  Cohen,  if  Fm  not  mis  taken.

Kovacs.  “But  if  he  changed  his  name,  he  must  have  some  special  status.  What  could  it  be?  A  doctorate  from  the  university?”   At  which  point  the  scholar  turned  to  the  young  man  and  said:  “How  do  you  do,  Dr  Kovacs?”   “Very  well,  thank-you,  sir”  answered  the  startled  passen  ger.  “But  how  do  you  know  my   name?”   “Oh,”  replied  the  scholar,  “it  was  obvious”.

"  Hie  only  Jewish  artist  in  Cooktown   THE  Blender  Gallery  in  Paddington  has  lifted  the  lid  on  a  new  form  of  botanical  art,  fresh  from  Nature’s  Powerhouse  Museum  in  Cooktown,  j  far  north  Queensland.   :  Gallery  directors  Tali  Udovich  |  and  Shane  Herbert  are  hosting  a  |  new  visual  art  style  called  Hyper  I  Reality  in  an  exhibition  by  botanical  I  artist  and  photographer  Stuart   Owen  Fox.

Born  in  the  US  of  Russian  and  Polish  descent,  Fox  lived  there  until  the  age  of  22,  when  he  became  a  classic  wandering  Jew.   Visiting  and  working  on  commis  sions  in  81  countries,  he  finally  ended  up  in  Cooktown  in  the  region  of  Cape  York,  where  the  oldest  known  art  originated.  To  the  local  Aboriginal  elders,  ancient  Egyptian  art  is  perceived  as  “modem  art”.   Fox’s  Hyper  Reality  images  have  catapulted  him  out  of  retirement  and  into  his  new-found  artistic  home  at  Cooktown’s  Nature’s  Powerhouse  Museum.   There  has  been  an  overwhelming  response  to  his  works  from  numer  ous  Australian  and  international  vis  itors.   “We’ve  had  botanists  and  pho  tographers  say  they  have  never  seen  anything  like  it,”  said  Nature’s  Powerhouse  Museum  co-ordinator  Jo  Wynter.   Fox’s  current  exhibition  of  Hyper  Reality  images  opened  last  week  at  Paddington’s  Blender  Gallery.   “Fox  was  interested  in  doing  an  exclusive  Sydney  show  for  his  first   solo  exhibition,”  said  Udovich.  “He  fell  in  love  with  our  space,  and  was  impressed  with  the  vibe  and  the  potential  it  created  for  his  show.”   Working  with  local  botanical  and  wildlife  specimens  to  create  images  of  intricate  detail  and  three-dimen  sional  appearance,  Fox  has  titled  his  new  visual  explorations  The  New  Cooktown  School  of  Botanical  Art,  and  is  credited  with  being  the  first  person  to  use  a  high-end  digital  scanner  to  produce  images  that  sur  pass  the  quality  of  large  plate  film  photographs.   About  9000  people  attended  the  opening  weekend  of  a  recent  exhibi  tion  of  Fox’s  work  at  the  Tanks  Art  Centre  in  Cairns’  Botanical  Gardens.   Udovich  and  Herbert  see  Fox’s  show  as  a  body  of  work  that  epito  mises  the  boundless  creative  forces  of  Blender  Gallery,  as  well  as  a  dis  covery  of  an  unusual  Jewish  artist.   Blender  Gallery  has  many  future  events  involving  young  Jewish  artists  planned,  including  an  exhibi  tion  of  Young  Jewish  Photographic  Artists,  a  solo  show  by  photogra  pher  Sally  Bierman  and  a  collabora  tive  show  by  Renee  Campbell.

"  Elvis  Schmelvis  —  how  Jewish  was  he?   Bram  Eisenthal   MONTREAL  —  When  the  film  Schmelvis:  Searching  for  the  King’s  Jewish  Roots  was  the  premiere  event  at  the  Toronto  Jewish  Film  Festival  last  week,  no-one  knew  quite  what  to  expect.   The  film  was  shot  two  years  ago,  produced  by  young  film-makers  from  Montreal,  and  that’s  when  the  buzz  began.   For  fans  of  Elvis  Presley,  this  was  a  revelation  of  almost  biblical  pro  portions.  Was  the  king  a  cantor?  Not  quite.   The  76-minute  satirical  docu  mentary  follows  Elvis  impersonator  Dan  Hartal,  who  uses  the  stage  name  Schmelvis,  spreading  the  gospel  that  Elvis  Aaron  Presley  was   a  Jew.   Well,  his  great-great-maternal   grandmother,  Nancy  Burdine,  was  Jewish  at  least.  And  therein  lies  one  of  the  more  interesting  tales  about  the  king,  a  story  that  makes  for  compelling  and  hilarious  viewing.   “I  like  Elvis.  Who  doesn’t?”  asked  Rabbi  Reuben  Poupko,  the  spiritual  leader  of  Montreal’s  Beth  Israel  Beth  Aaron.   His  appreciation  for  Elvis’  music  led  him  to  accept  a  small  role  in  the  film,  where  he  is  seen  informing  individuals  about  Elvis’  Jewish   roots.   “I  ended  up  becoming  a  charac  ter,  offering  some  spiritual  perspec  tive  and  humour.  It  was  great  fun  to  do,  as  we  spent  a  week  apiece  in  Memphis  and  Israel,  spreading  the  word,”  Poupko  said.   “I  also  thought  it  might  be  an  interesting  examination  of  the  issue  of  assimilation  in  America,”  added  the  Pittsburgh  native.  “This  is  a  film   about  Jewish  identity  as  much  as  it  is  about  the  king  of  rock  ‘n’  roll.”   For  genealogical  buffs,  Nancy  Burdine  gave  birth  to  Martha  Tackett,  who  begat  Doll  Mansell,  whose  daughter  Gladys  Smith   birthed  Elvis.   Elvis’  Jewish  roots  piqued  the  interest  of  the  founders  of  the  Diversus  studio,  Ari  Cohen,  Evan  Beloff  and  Max  Wallace,  who  start  ed  the  company  in  1998  as  a  means  of  “developing  cultural  projects  with  a  conscience”.   The  company  got  its  start  with  the  assistance  of  a  Montreal  pro  gram  which  provides  interest-free  loans  to  Jews  under  the  age  of  40  who  are  launching  business  ven   tures.   “Although  Elvis  was  a  practising  Christian,  he  was  very  aware  of  his  Jewish  roots,”  said  writer-director  Wallace,  a  journalist  who  has  writ   ten  a  book  on  boxer  Muhammad  Ali.   “His  manager,  Colonel  Tom  Parker,  told  him  never  to  talk  about  it,  because  he  thought  it  would  hurt  his  career.  But  he  found  subtle  ways  of  expressing  his  Jewishness.”   Elvis  never  forgot  that  when  he  was  a  boy,  the  Jewish  community  paid  for  him  to  attend  summer  camp,  Wallace  added.  He  “donated  a  lot  of  money  to  the  Memphis  Jewish  community.  In  fact,  he  used  to  play  racquetball  at  the  communi  ty  centre  after  midnight,  when  it  was  specially  opened  for  him  only.   “When  his  mother  died  in  1959,  he  made  sure  to  put  a  Star  of  David  on  her  headstone.  For  the  last  two   years  of  his  life,  he  wore  a  chai   around  his  neck.”   For  Shlomo  Schwartzberg,  pro  gramming  director  of  the  Toronto  Jewish  Film  Festival,  getting  this  movie  for  opening  night  was  a  coup.   Some  850  seats  were  filled  for  the  screening,  Schwartzberg  said.   “This  is  a  satire  on  Jewish  identi   ty  and  a  really  original  movie  about  pop  culture,”  he  added.  “It  is  the  story  of  Elvis’  relationship  with  Jews,  based  to  some  degree  on   fact.”   JTA ",2002-05-03
"  Champions  abound  at  Jewish  Swimming  Championships   Anthony  Gcodri^e   REIGNING  Australian  Jewish  News  Cup  holders  Sarah  Dickinson  and  David  Rifkin  successfully  •^defended  their  trophies  at  the  52nd  NSW  Jew   ish  Swimming  Championships,  holding  off  chal  lenges  from  a  classy  field.   Sickness  and  injuries  reduced  the  field,  but  the  standard  of  competition  was  very  high  throughout  the  night,  with  16  records  broken  or  equalled.   The  night  saw  the  graduation  of  several  age  group  stars  as  David  Schnabl,  Jessica  Davey,  Daniel  Coleman  and  Adam  Muniz  all  won  Open  events  for  the  first  time.   Among  the  highlights:   •  Sarah  Dickinson  and  Yael  Galgut  going  stroke  for  stroke  in  the  open  women’s  100m  freestyle  with  Dickinson  just  touching  out  Galgut.  This  was  Dickinson’s  fourth  title  in  suc  '  ^cession  and  her  sixth  overall.   «  David  Rifkin  made  it  four  straight  after  another  record-breaking  swim.  David  Schnabl  and  Adam  Muniz  were  not  far  behind  and  they  are  on  the  cusp  of  seriously  challenging  Rivkin.  The  duo  has  company  with  David  Goltsman,  Shaun  Greenblo,  Warren  Kotzen  and  Zac  Stein  all  closing  in  on  Rifkin  as  well.   •  Yael  Galgut  and  Jessica  Cantori  battling  in  the  15yrs  50m  freestyle.  Another  stroke-for  stroke  race  with  Galgut  touching  first  and  breaking  Cherie  Silver’s  record.   •  The  Gentin  sisters’  domination.  The  only  separation  between  Sara,  who  won  every  11  years  event,  and  Manthy  (10)  was  Sara’s  win  in  the  individual  medley  for  12-and-under.   ™  •  David  Goltsman’s  50m  freestyle  record.  At   the  end  of  the  evening,  Goltsman  pulled  out  a  huge  freestyle  effort  with  a  25.86,  similar  to  his  national  finalist  swim  of  a  month  ago.  Compar  ing  age  groups,  if  there  was  one  swim  of  the  evening  who  could  be  classed  as  national  stan  dard,  this  was  it.  Goltsman  also  smashed  the  14yrs  50m  breaststroke  record.   •  Adam  Muniz  firmly  stamped  himself  as  a  pillar  of  Jewish  swimming  as  he  left  the  evening  with  a  fistful  of  medals  and  records.With  Daniel  Coleman,  he  is  fast  developing  as  an  inspira  tional  and  motivational  leader  for  Jewish  swim  mers  in  Sydney.   •  David  Schnabl’s  backstroke  excellence.

Ron  Sneiderman,  62,  excelled  and  had  many  observers  poolside  shaking  their  heads  at  his  fitness,  while  Michael   Kohn  debuted  in  the  breaststroke.   The  success  of  the  over  30s  event  has  led  Maccabi  officials  to  look  into  more  masters   competitions,  particularly  with  masters  swim  ming  as  an  event  next  year  at  the  Pan  American   Maccabi  Games  in  Venezuela.   On  Sunday,  the  Eight-and-Under  champi  onships  were  held  with  some  good  swims  from  the  young  boys  and  girls.

"  Russian  Jewish  flavour  on  Sydney  stage   Lee  Kofman   ANYONE  who  left  Russia  before  the  Iron  Curtain  was  lifted  will  find  it  difficult  to  imagine  the  following  scene:  a  well-known  hall  in  Moscow  filled  with  people  listening  to  a  Jewish  performer  singing  Eli,  Eli  in  fluent  Hebrew,  her  head  held  high.   What  is  most  amazing  is  that  there  are  no  armed  KGB  agents  attempting  to  stop  the  performance.  Even  after  Perestroika  and  Glasnost,  it  was  hard  to  believe  that  this  scene  was  not  from  a  science-fiction  film.   Against  all  odds,  the  Jewish  theatre  company  Shalom  was  established  in  Moscow  in  1988.  What  was  even  more  surprising  was  that  the  government  funded   it.   Next  week  Shalom  Theatre  will  perform  a  cabaret-style  show,  Gefilte  fish  with  spice,  in  Sydney  as  part  of  its  first  Australian  tour.   The  show,  at  the  University  of  New  South  Wales  on  Friday,  March  1,  will  feature  a  mixture  of  cabaret  performances,  dancing,  singing  in  Hebrew,  Russian  and  Yiddish,  and   Jewish  humour.   The  Association  of  Jews  from  the  former   Soviet  Union  (also  known  as  the  Shalom  Association)  and  Russian  Leisure  video  libraries  are  organising  the  visit.   Well-known  Russian  actor  Alexander  Levinbuck  established  the  Shalom  Theatre  14  years  ago.  In  1987  he  teamed  up  with  actor  Arcadi  Hayat  to  stage  Trum  Balalaika,  a  play  with  Jewish  themes.   “The  success  of  the  performance  was  above  all  our  expectations  and  we  were  invited  to  bring  it  to  Broadway,”  Levinbuck  said  by  telephone  from  Moscow.   “We  thought  that  if  such  Jewish  performance  succeeds  on  Broadway,  we  must  do  something  at  home.  So  in  1988,  with  the  help  of  well-known  Russian  Jewish  singer  Josef  Kobzon,  we  founded  the  Shalom  Theatre.  Since  then,  we  have  performed  in  Europe,  America  and  Israel.”   Levinbuck  said  it  was  important  for  the   Shalom  Theatre  to  retain  some  characteristics  of  traditional  Jewish  theatre.  “It  was  also  important  to  introduce  modern  elements  both  from  the  point  of  view  of  plays  performed  and  of  the  style  of  the  performances.   “For  instance,  Shalom  Aleichem’s  traditional  play  The  Wandering  Stars  had  new  music  composed  and  both  the  choreography  and  costumes  were  in  less  traditional  style.   “It  was  also  important  for  us  to  talk  to  our  audience  about  the  everyday  problems  that  are  facing  Jews  living  in  today’s  Russia.   “It  cannot  be  said  that  there  is  no  antisemitism  in  daily  life.  For  example,  there  was  graffiti  on  the  walls  of  the  theatre  on  one  occasion  which  read  ‘The  place  of  Jews  is  in   factories’.   “During  my  next  television  appearance  I  said  that  this  is  not  a  bad  beginning,   Dancers  from  Moscow's  Shalom  Theatre.   considering  the  unemployment  ...  but  seriously,  in  the  past  14  years  since  the   theatre  was  resurrected  I  have  not  encountered  much  antisemitism,  especially  not  from  the  government.   “Nowadays  the  Prime  Minister  receives  the  Chief  Rabbi  for  audiences  and  the  Mayor  of  Moscow  is  seen  dancing  in  a  synagogue.  Jewish  holidays  are  celebrated  in  the  Kremlin  in  the  presence  of  up  to  17,000  Jews.   “The  Jewish  culture  has  come  to  life  again  and  is  prospering.  In  Moscow  there  are  more  than  60  Jewish  organisations  and  five  synagogues.  Tens  of  Jewish  publications  are  published  regularly,  as  well  as  books  on  Judaism  and  related  topics.   Alexander  Levinbuck   “Under  the  Communist  regime,  a  theatre  like  Shalom  could  not  have  existed.  Judaism  was  always  closely  linked  with  religion  and  that  was  in  direct  conflict  with  Communist  ideology.”   “Under  the  Communist  regime,  a  theatre  like  Shalom  could  not  have   existed.”   The  Shalom  Theatre  proved  to  be  turning  point  for  Levinbuck’s  Jewish  identity.  “When  1  arrived  at  the  theatre,  I  felt  Jewish  only  because  it  said  so  in  my  passport.  But  I  never  denied  being  a  Jew.  I  did  not  take  a  Russian  surname,  as  many  Jewish  artists  did.  I  always  was  Levinbuck.   “1  did  not  know  a  thing  about  Judaism  and  Jewish  traditions.  In  Soviet  Russia,   Jewish  tradition  survived  only  in  the  provinces  such  as  Balkan  and  Ukraine.   “In  Moscow  only  a  few  Jews  attended  synagogues  or  knew  anything  about  Jewish  holidays.  Only  when  I  joined  the  theatre,  I  started  to  read  books  about  Judaism  and  started  to  discuss  the  topic  with  people  knowledgeable  in  this  field.   “In  fact  there  was  no  choice.  For  example,  when  we  started  the  preparation  of  the  play  Shosha  by  Basevits  Singer,  the  cast  realised  it  was  not  ready  for  this  play  and  that  we  had  to  study  to  understand  our  Jewish   roots.   “And  that  was  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  play  was  not  directed  only  at  an  elite   audience.  The  whole  audience  was   emotionally  involved.”   In  Moscow  the  Shalom  Theatre  performed  mainly  for  Jewish  people,  but  outside  the  capital  there  were  many  Russians  in  the  audience.  “We  are  attempting  to  widen  our  repertoire  to  appeal  to  all  ages  and  all  groups.”   Levinbuck  was  not  always  an  actor.  After  graduating  from  school,  he  studied  medicine,  where  he  met  a  number  of  future  actors  and  musicians,  who  had  also  started  out  as  medical  students.  “I  don’t  know  what  was  in  the  air  at  the  university,”  he  laughs,  “but  I  never  practised  medicine.”   ■  Lee  Kofman  is  a  published  author  in  Israel  and  worked  as  a  journalist  on  Ma’ariv.

"  E  Books   Medicine  and  the  Jewish  connection   Jews  and  Medicine:  An  Epic  Saga   Frank  Heynick   KTAVPublishing,  2002,  602pages,  $89.95   Reviewed  by  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Cohen   FOR  at  least  1000  years,  no  matter  where  their  wanderings  led,  Jews  have  been  recognised  by  friend  and  foe  as  important  contributors  to  our  medical  knowledge.  Even  in  intolerant  surroundings,  they  have  filled  the  ranks  of  physicians  out  of  proportion  to  their  numbers  in  the  population.  Only  over  the  past  decade  or  so,  has  the  number  of  Jews  enrolled  in  medical  schools  declined.   Historically  speaking,  one  might  almost  say  that  medicine  has  been  the  Jewish  profession  —  not  just  in  our  modem  scientific  age,  but  also  in  the  long  era  when  medicine  was  largely  groping  in  the  dark.  As  I  read  this  book,  I  continually  recalled  „  Noah  Gordon’s  novel  Shaman  which   told  of  an  Englishman’s  desire  to  become  a  physician  and  his  trials  and  tribulations  to  attain  that  goal.   The  reasons  for  this  intimate  link  between  Jews  and  medicine  have  varied  considerably  across  centuries  and  continents.  Book  learning;  religious  attitudes  towards  the  body;  superstitious  awe  among  gentiles;  the  portability  of  medical  knowledge  across  borders;  historical  tradition;  and  (in  more  modern  times)  independent  and  creative  thinking  of  the  “outsider”  have  all  contributed  to  this  unique  0.3  relationship.   The  book  tells  the  history  of  Jews  in  medicine  as  a  flowing  epic,  from  the  pre-biblical  era  to  the  mid-20th  century;  from  the  Middle  East,  through  the  countries  of  Southern,  Eastern  and  Northern  Europe,  to  the  Orient  and  to  America  —  always   against  the  backdrop  of  the  times  in  which  they  lived.   I  found  the  opening  chapter  entitled  “The  Wandering  Jew  as  Doctor”  fascinating  as  it  set  the  scene  for  not  only  the  book,  but  an  understanding  of  the  world  in  which  each  stage  in  the  development  of  medicine  occurred.   “In  telling  the  story  of   medicine,  it  is  important  to   understand  the  social,   religious,  cultural,   psychological  and  political   background  as  much  as  the   medical  discovery.”   I  remember  as  a  child  learning  about  immunology  being  discovered  by  accident.  In  telling  the  story  of  medicine,  it  is  important  to  understand  the  social,  religious,  cultural,  psychological  and  political   background  as  mucn  as  tne  medical  discovery.  Why  was  it  only  in  the  19th  century  that  physicians  discovered  the  need  to  sterilise  the  operating  environment,  while  Jewish  law  and  tradition  had  required  it  for  centuries,  if  not  millennia.  It  was  not  a  special  insight  of  the  Jew,  but  rather  conformity  with  religious  tradition.   The  book  also  narrates  the  most  important  scientific  accomplish   ments  of  the  likes  of  Maimonides  j  (classical  medicine);  Cohn  (germ  j  theory);  Freud  (psychoanalysis);  Ehrlich  (immunology  and  chemotherapy);  Chain  (penicillin);  and  Waksman  (antibiotics),  as  well  as  many  other  luminaries  and  Nobel  Prize  winners.  Not  withstanding  all   this,  I  felt  uncomfortable  with  the  j  author’s  implication  that  there  is  something  in  being  Jewish  which  gives  some  45  winners  of  the  Nobel  Prize  in  medicine  an  advantage  over  all  others.   The  writer  in  presenting  the  history  of  medicine  as  he  does,  accepts  that  we  are  chemical  or  biological  machines  which  will  be  finetuned  until  eventually  nothing  can  or  will  go  wrong.  Many  believe  that  medicine  is  more  than  this  and  the  text  only  goes  partially  along  the  path  of  seeing  each  of  us  as  a  complex  holistic  person  and  not  just  a  chemical  complex  machine.   This  book  should  be  read  by  anyone  who  seeks  any  understand  ing  of  how  medicine  has  reached  the  level  at  which  it  operates  today.  Jews  have  made  significant  contributions  to  the  field,  but  we  must  always  be  careful  of  triumphalism  and  particularism  in  recounting  the  story.

This  exhibi  tion  explores  the  Jewish  history  of  Shanghai,  focusing  on  the  city  as  a  haven  for  Jews  during  World  War  II.  Crossroads  pays  tribute  to  the  excit  ing  international  metropolis  of  Shanghai  and  tells  the  stories  of  the  Jews  who  created  a  thriving  com  munity  in  their  new  and  unfamiliar   environment.   Many  Shanghai  Jews  migrated  to  Australia  after  WWII  and  have  made  significant  contributions  to  the  Australian  community.  The  personal  stories  told  in  Crossroads  have  been  gleaned  from  these  people  and  their  families,  many  of  whom  generously  shared  their  own  experiences  and  have  loaned  artefacts  for  the  exhi  bition.   Fred  Gunsberger,  who  now  lives  in  Sydney’s  inner  West,  escaped  Nazism  in  Austria  and  his  story  of  escape  is  now  told  in  the  Crossroads  exhibition.  Fred  lived  in  the  Hong  Kew  ghetto  in  Shanghai  where  there  was  poor  sanitation  and  overcrowd   ed  conditions.  Artefacts  relating  to  Fred’s  journey  from  Austria  and  his  new  life  in  Shanghai  are  on  display  in  the  exhibition,  including  the  trunk  brought  from  Austria  by  Fred’s  wife  to  be,  Sabine  Sandberg.  Fred  took  with  him  prized  possessions  such  as  his  Austrian  national  costume  jacket  and  tools  for  his  work  as  a  chemist  in  Vienna,  in  order  to  gain  work  in  Shanghai.   “Many  Shanghai  Jews   migrated  to  Australia  after   VWVII  and  have  made   significant  contributions  to  the  Australian  community.'7   The  artefacts  highlight  the  differ  ent  origins  of  the  Shanghai  Jews,  including  Sephardic,  Russian  and  central  European  refugees.  The  rich  silk,  ivory  and  silver  artefacts  on  display  represent  the  wealth  of  the  Baghdadi  (Sephardic)  Jews,  many  of  whom  created  great  empires  in  Shanghai  in  the  early  1900s.  Others  came  from  Russia  escaping  pogroms  and  re-built  comfortable  lifestyles.  The  exhibition  also  dis   plays  a  rare  exit  visa,  tools  of  trade  and  small  mementos  of  Jewish  life  in  Europe  that  were  brought  by  European  Jews  to  Shanghai.  A  Jewish  prayer  shawl  with  an  ornate  Chinese  embroidered  cover  and  Chinese  silver  Kiddush  cups  reflect  the  exotic  combination  of  cultures  that  met  in  Shanghai.

"  News   UNSW  Jewish  Studies  in  danger   Alton  Lee   THE  Jewish  Studies  program  at  the  University  of  New  South  Wales  is  in  danger  of  folding,  following  the  loss  of  a  $50,000  annual  sponsorship  from  Hakoah  Club.   The  crisis  has  been  precipitated  by  Hakoah’s  decision  not  to  renew  its  funding  arrangement,  which  has  been  in  place  since  the  inception  of  the  program  in  1996,  in  view  of  its  own  financial  difficulties  (story  below).   UNSW  will  review  the  future  of  the  program  later  this  year.   Located  within  the  UNSW  School  of  Politics  and  International  Relations,  the  Jewish  Studies  program  is  co-ordinated  by  Dr  Geoffrey  Brahm  Levey.   There  are  currently  120  students  enrolled  in  the  four  Jewish  Studies  courses  on  offer,  with  more  than  200  expected  to  take  the  five  Jewish  Studies  courses  being  offered  in  the  second  semester.   Although  there  has  been  discussion  with  the  Joint  Higher   Committee  for  Jewish  Education   about  funding  the  lectureship  for  the  next  three  years,  Dr  Levey  is  not  optimistic.   “This  arrangement  is  no  solution,”  he  said  this  week.  “The  university  has  indicated  that  funding  based  on  annual  grants  will  not  be  entertained  indefinitely;  we  need  an  endowment,  which  costs  $1  million.  The  Joint  Comm  ittee  doesn’t  appreciate  this.”   In  the  meantime,  UNSW  (which  matched  Hakoah’s  funds)  and  the  Joint  Higher  Committee  for  Jewish   Dr  Geoffrey  Brahm  Levey   Education  (which  pays  for  Jewish  Studies  lecturers  from  the  University  of  Sydney  to  teach  at  UNSW)  will  continue  funding  the  UNSW  program,  but  this  is  neither  indefinite  nor  adequate.   If  the  program  folds,  students   would  be  able  to  cross-enroll  in  Jewish  Studies  courses  at  the   University  of  Sydney.   In  excess  of  1000  students  have  taken  Jewish  Studies  courses  at   UNSW  since  the  program  was  established.   Jewish  Studies  is  the  second  most  popular  “cultural  studies”   program  at  UNSW  after  Australian  Studies,  Dr  Levey  said.  “That  is  extraordinary,  especially  from  a  standing  start  in  1997.   “We  are  grateful  to  Hakoah  for   its  contribution.  It  should  never  have  fallen  to  Hakoah  to  sustain   the  program.  Despite  efforts  to  establish  an  endowment,  we  have  not  been  successful.”   Hakoah  tried  to  launch  a   campaign  for  a  Jewish  Studies   chair  at  UNSW  at  its  60th  anniversary  dinner  in  1998,  Dr  Levey  said,  raising  $100,000  on  the  night.   However,  concerns  were  expressed  that  the  fundraising  was  outside  “accepted  channels”,  and  the  campaign  ended,  he  said.   The  club  used  the  money  raised  at  the  dinner  to  fund  its  support  of  the  lectureship.   An  attempt  to  fundraise  through  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  and  the  Joint  Committee  for   Jewish  Higher  Education  met  with   resistance  from  both   organisations,  he  said.   The  UNSW  Vice-Chancellor  also   approached  several  individuals,  and  Dr  Levey  sought  the  support  of  a  US  bank,  but  to  no  avail.   Dr  Levey  is  at  a  loss  to  understand  why  there  has  been  so  little  support  from  Jewish  sources.  “Especially  puzzling  is  the  lack  of  enthusiasm  to  endow  the  program  in  perpetuity.   “Community  members  give  millions  to  universities  in  Israel,  so  the  reason  can’t  be  lack  of  interest  in  universities.”   The  program  enables  Jewish  students  to  explore  their  heritage   and  educates  non-Jewish  students  about  Jews  and  the  Jewish  experience,  Dr  Levey  said.   “I  have  had  Buddhists,  Hindus,  Arab  Muslims  and  Christians,  Aborigines  and  all  manner  of   Christian  denominations  and   ethnicities  sitting  with  Jewish   students  to  learn  about  Jews  in  an   atmosphere  of  respect.  That  would  be  lost  if  the  program  ends.   “Do  we  want  UNSW,  which  has  the  most  Jewish  students  of  all  Sydney  universities,  not  to  have  a  Jewish  Studies  program?” ",2002-04-05
"  Restoring  Jewish-Camolic  relations  in  Poland   ABIon  Lee   EDUCATING  young  Catholic  Poles  about  the  Jewish  contribution  to  Polish  culture,  and  the  fraternity  that  the  two  religions  should  share,  is  the  way  to  ensure  the  wrongs  of  the  past  are  corrected,  according  to  visiting  Archbishop  Professor  Joseph  Zycinski.   The  Archbishop  of  Lublin,  Professor  Zycinski,  54,  is  active  in  interfaith  dialogue  between  Jews  and  Christians  in  Poland,  meeting  Jewish  leaders  on  a  regular  basis.   Brought  to  Australia  by  the  Australian  Polish  Institute  of  Public  Affairs,  he  was  appointed  Archbishop  of  Lublin  by  Pope  John  Paul  II.   He  pointed  out  that  Lublin’s  pre-Holocaust  Jewish  population,  which  did  not  survive,  accounted  for  37  per  cent  of  the  population.   “It  is  necessary  for  young  Poles  to  recognise  the  important  role  that  Jews  played  in  their  cul  ture  and  the  history  of  their  country  for  over  1000  years,”  Professor  Zycinski  emphasised.   Last  year,  every  Sunday  for  a  few  months,  he  visited  towns  to  preside  over  prayers  dedicated  to  those  murdered  in  the  Holocaust.   “I  am  hopeful  Jews  will  come   back  and  contribute  once  again  to   the  culture.”   Adamant  that  the  portrayal  of  Jews  as  Christ  killers  is  contrary  to  Catholic  teachings,  he  pointed  out  strides  being  made  in  Jewish  Catholic  dialogue.   Taking  pride  in  being  a  part  of  the  process,  he  said  he  tries  to  adhere  to  the  Pope’s  call  to  recognise  Jews  as  “elderly  brothers  in  faith”.   An  annual  Judaism  Day  is  observed  in  the  former  Nazi  death  camp  of  Majdanek  outside  Lublin,  Professor  Zycinski  said.   A  rabbi  leads  Jews  and  Catholics  in  prayer  for  the  250,000  Holocaust  victims  who  were  murdered  there,  half  of  whom  were  Jewish.   The  ceremony  is  followed  by  a  theological  discussion  between  Catholics  and  Jews  at  the  Lublin  priests’  seminary.   The  event  is  a  result  of  the  Pope’s  appeal  to  devote  one  day  of  the  “Week  of  Prayer  for   Archbishop  of  Lublin  Professor  Joseph  Zyclnski.   Christian  Unity”  towards  improved  dialogue   between  Christians  and  Jews.   Admitting  to  difficulty  with  the  question   whether  the  Church  have  done  more  to  save   Jews,  he  replied:  “You  can  always  do  more”.   He  cited  a  number  of  instances  where   priests,  nuns  and  Polish  peasants  risked  their  lives  to  shelter  Jews,  including  the  famous  Brother  Daniel  Rufeisen,  who  hid  for  more  than  a  year  in  the  local  convent,  dressed  as  a  nun.   Professor  Zycinski  was  bom  in  Czestochowa,  where  the  famous  painting  of  the  Virgin  Mary  called  the  Black  Madonna  resides.   Known  as  Our  Lady  of  Czestochowa,  the  Black  Madonna  is  considered  the  queen  and  protector  of  Poland.  Professor  Zycinski  takes  great  pridein  the  fact  that  he  was  bom  there,  he  said,  because  Jesus’  mother  was  Jewish.  “How  many  people  can  say  they  were  bom  where  a  Jewish  queen  lives?”   A  philosopher  and  physicist,  Professor  Zycinski  has  written  several  books  on  science.   Unsure  if  Poland  will  ever  again  see  a  thriv  ing  Jewish  population,  he  remains  optimistic.  “Thirty  years  ago,  there  were  no  Vietnamese  in  Poland;  today  we  have  many  shops  and  restau  rants.  I  am  hopeful  Jews  will  come  back  and  contribute  once  again  to  the  culture.” ",2002-09-27
"  Books   Marking  Jewish  events   The  Book  of  Jewish  Sacred  Practices   Edited  by  Irwin  Kula  and  Vanessa  Ochs   Jewish  Lights,  2001,  338  pp,  $44.95   Reviewed  by  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Cohen   THE  National  Jewish  Centre  for  Learning  and  Leadership,  better  known  as  CLAL,  was  established  by  Rabbi  Yitz  Greenberg  some  25  years  ago.  As  part  of  his  work  in  Jewish  *-■  leadership  development,  he  pro   duced  one  of  the  best  introductions  to  Judaism  books  The  Jewish  Way,  for  it  did  not  treat  the  reader  as  an  adolescent,  but  rather  as  a  thinking  educated  adult.  In  picking  up  this  book  by  his  successor  at  CLAL,  I  was  expecting  the  sequel  in  a  sense.   This  book  is  loyal  to  the  values  of  Yitz  Greenberg  and  CLAL,  but  differ  ent  in  so  many  ways.  The  temptation  is  to  open  the  book  and  dismiss  it  as  a  book  of  prayers  and  meditations.  It  is  that,  but  so  much  more.  Our  sages  knew  that  there  was  no  experience  in  the  life  of  a  Jew  that  cannot  be   ^  marked  in  Jewish  ways.  Sometimes,   there  are  situations  when  the  avail  able  Jewish  rituals  just  don’t  seem  to  fit  the  situation  and  we  need  to  adapt  them.  There  are  also  times  when  there  really  isn’t  an  obvious  Jewish  way  to  mark  some  of  the  events  of  our  lives  and  we  must  develop  new  ones,  albeit  based  on  tradition.   This  challenge  was  made  clear  to  me  recently  when  friends  suffered  bereavement.  There  were  layers  and  layers  of  halachot  (Jewish  Laws)  about  burial  and  mourning  and  yet   there  was  nothing  to  mark  the  end  of  the  first  seven  days.  Various  col  leagues  had  responded  in  different  ways.  In  this  book  I  found  a  text  which  could  have  been  meaningful  at  that  moment  when  the  mourners  moved  from  shiv’ah  (mourning)   back  into  the  world.   I  am  sure  many  of  the  traditional  ists  among  us  would  be  tempted  to  dismiss  this  book  as  being  too  con  temporary,  while  others  will  look  at  it  as  American  “mushugas”.  There  were  sections  that  I  struggled  to  take  too  seriously,  such  as  “Running  a  Marathon”  or  “Saying  Goodbye  to  a  Beloved  Pet”,  although  in  both  cases  I  can  appreciate  that  a  person  may  need  to  mark  such  a  milestone.

"  Jewish  welfare  struggling  in  South  Africa   THE  diminishing  Jewish  community  in  South  Africa  is  struggling  to  care  for  its  needy,  says  a   former  welfare  worker  who  wants  the   Australian  Jewish  community  to  help.   “South  African  Jews  are  facing  a  critical  situation,”  says  Leonore  Abrahams,  a  former  chairwoman  of  Johannesburg’s  Jewish  Women’s  Benevolent  Society  who  immigrated  to  Perth  three  years  ago.   South  African  Jewry  has  shrunk  by  a  third  in  five  years,  from  90,000  to  65,000,  so  there  are  fewer  people  to  provide  assistance  for  communal  organisations,  she  said.   In  November  2000,  Ms  Abrahams  launched  a  non-profit  fundraising  organisation  called  Australian  Arm  of  South  African  Jewry.  It  has  sent  $7000  to  South  Africa  to  date.   This  week,  the  group  embarked  on  a  campaign  to  raise  further  funds  for  the  ageing  Jewish  community  in  South  Africa.   Many  expatriates  have  family  in  old-age  homes  in  South  Africa,  Ms  Abrahams  said.  “It’s  a  huge  financial  burden  to  migrate,  and  in  some  cases  it’s  difficult  to  take  care  of  family  still  in  South  Africa.”   Australian  Arm  has  received  approval  from  South  Africa’s  Benevolent  Society,  Chevra  Kadisha  (which  encompasses  the  Our  Parents  Home  aged  care  facility)  and  Sandringham  Gardens  (Johannesburg’s  Montefiore  Home  equivalent,  catering  for  300  residents)  to  collect  funds  on  their  behalf.   Any  funds  raised  in  Australia  would  be  shared  between  the  three.   The  Benevolent  Society,  the  oldest  Jewish  women’s  welfare  organisation  in  Johan   nesburg,  assists  2000  disadvantaged  families  with  accommodation,  clothing,  food,  education,  counselling  and  education.   The  Chevra  Kadisha  is  an  umbrella  body  which  provides  food,  shelter  and  medication  to  thousands,  including  228  youth  under  18.   Combined,  the  charities  require  75  million  rand  to  continue  functioning,  Ms  Abrahams  said.  “We  have  left  a  huge  problem  behind.  Welfare  is  crumbling.  People  need  assistance  to  stay  in  their  own  homes  and  buy  food.”   With  the  rand  currently  worth  one-sixth  of  an  Australian  dollar,  even  small  donations  are  significant,  she  said.   In  Johannesburg  the  Yeoville  and  Berea  synagogues  have  closed  in  the  past  six  years.   Donations  to  Australian  Arm  of  South  African  Jewry  can  be  sent  to  PO  Box  1433,  South  Perth,  Western  Australia,  6951. ",2002-03-29

"  He’s  Shimmy,   ami  te’s  Jewish   LOOKING  for  something   more  kosher  than  Barbie   and  Ken?  A  Tel  Aviv  compa  ny  has  the  answer.   Shimmy  is  the  first  Jewish  doll  —  observant,  even.   “We  started  with  a  boy  because  of  the  fact  that  girls  have  chests,”  says  market  ing  director  Budi  Dvir.   The  37.5cm  toy  is  unlike  other  dolls.  To  adhere  to  the  Ten  Commandments’  ban  on   making  “graven  images”,  he  has  chubby  cheeks,  a  little  button  nose  and  four  fingers   on  each  hand  instead  of  five.   When  you  squeeze  one  of  Shimmy’s  hands,  he  recites  the  Shema;  squeeze  the  other  and  he  says  Mode  Ani.   “Shimmy  is  built  around  Jewish  law,”  said  Dvir.  “Religious  children  need  a  character  to  identify  with.”   Sales  have  taken  off.  “I  just  can’t  get  enough  stocks,”  says  Shalom  Halpern,  a  toyshop  owner  in  an  Orthodox  neighbourhood  of   Jerusalem.   “When  I  first  got  it,  I  was  sceptical.  But  people  just  keep  buying.”   However,  Shimmy  has  competition  from  the  Arab   world  in  the  form  of  Dara  and  Sara.  The  two  Muslim  dolls  have  been  developed  by  an  Iranian  Government  agency  to  promote  tradition   al  values.   Dara  and  Sara  are  clad  in   modest  clothing;  Sara  never  goes  out  without  a  headscarf  or  unaccompanied  by  her  brother,  Dara.

"  A  scene  from  the  opening  night  film,  Nowhere  In  Africa.   Me  Without  You   Elvis  Presley  Impersonator  Dan  Haral  In  SchmeMs.   Holocaust  themes  at  Jewish  film  festival   Danny@oss   FILMS  set  during  World  War  II  are  prominent  in  this  year’s  Festival  of  Jewish  Cinema  which  opens  in  Melbourne  next  month.   The  festival  will  open  on  Wednes  day,  November  6  with  Nowhere  in  Africa,  a  German  award-winning  film  by  Caroline  Link  which  tells  the  story  of  a  German  Jewish  family  which  flees  and  finds  refuge  in  East  Africa  on  the  eve  of  World  War  U.   Adapted  from  the  best-selling  autobiography  of  Stefanie  Zweig,  the  film  tells  the  story  of  Walter  and  Jettel  Redlich,  and  their  daughter  Regina,  as  they  carve  out  a  new  life  in  Kenya.   Walter,  a  lawyer,  finds  menial  employment  as  a  farm  caretaker,  but  Jettel  has  trouble  coping  with  their  new  lifestyle.  Regina,  however,  delights  in  the  magic  of  the  new  land.   Nowhere  in  Africa  is  a  dramatic  film  about  members  of  a  Jewish  fam  ily  tom  from  its  cultural  roots  and  having  to  rebuilt  their  lives.   French  director  Yolande  Zauberman’s  film  The  War  in  Paris  is  about  a  Jewish  family  living  under  the  German  occupation  of  Paris.   It  tells  the  story  of  19-year-old  Jules  Poznanski  who  is  blackmailed  by  the  French  police  to  become  an  informer  in  order  to  save  his  Polish  born  parents  and  French-born  brother.  The  War  in  Paris  offers  a  fresh  look  at  the  occupation.   The  latest  film  by  acclaimed  Israeli  director  Amos  Gitai,  Kedma,  was  one  of  the  hits  of  the  Cannes  Film  Festival.   Set  in  1948  in  the  days  leading  up  to  Israel’s  War  of  Independence,  the  ship  Kedma  carries  hundreds  of   Holocaust  survivors  towards  the  coast  of  Palestine.  They  want  to  settle  peacefully  in  the  land  of  their  dreams,  but  the  British  soldiers  are  determined  to  prevent  the  ship  landing.   Many  of  the  new  arrivals  manage  to  elude  the  soldiers  and  team  up  with  the  Palmach  to  continue  the   fight  against  the  British  and  the   Arabs.   Gitai’s  other  films  include  Kippur  and  Kadosh.   Me  Without  You  is  a  British  comedy  directed  by  Sandra  Goldbacher  about  the  tempestuous,  long-running  relationship  between  two  London  girls.   The  film,  loosely  based  on  Goldbacher’s  own  life,  tells  the  story  of  the  insecure  Holly  (who  is  Jewish  and  played  by  Michelle  Williams)  and  the  overbearing  Marina  (who  is  not  and  is  played  by  Anna  Friel).   As  youngsters  they  make  a  pact  to  be  friends  forever  and  we  follow  their  lives  as  teenagers,  university  students  and  mothers  over  the  years  from  the  70s  to  2001.   “The  latest  film  by  acclaimed   Israeli  director  Amos  Gitai,   Kedma,  was  one  of  the  hits  of   the  Cannes  Film  Festival.”   Writer-director  Julie  Davis  stars  in  the  romantic  comedy  Amy’s  Orgasm,  an  entertaining  look  at  male-female  relationships.   Amy  Mandell  is  a  confident  and  successful  29-year-old  author  of  self-help  books.  However,  she  has  doubts  about  her  latest  book  on  why  women  don’t  need  men  and  this   leads  to  some  amusing  situations.  She  even  goes  to  confession  even  though  she  is  not  a  Catholic.   The  French  drama  Lisa  by  Pierre  Grimblat  is  set  around  a  25-year-old  film-maker  named  Sam  who  unravels  the  mystery  of  a  young  actor  who  disappeared  during  the  German  occupation  of  France.   In  the  process  he  finds  out  more  about  his  own  roots  and  improves  his  relationship  with  his  father.   The  Polish  film  Keep  Away  from  the  Window  is  set  in  a  small  Polish  town  under  German  occupation  dur  ing  World  War  II.  A  childless  couple   hide  a  Jewish  woman  who  has  an  affair  with  the  husband,  leading  to  a  surprise  twist  in  their  relationships.

Schmelvis:  Searching  for  the  king’s  Jewish  roots  follows  an  Orthodox  Jewish  Elvis  impersonator,  Dan  Hartal,  on  the  road.  It  researches,  with  plenty  of  humour,  whether  Presley  was  Jewish.   American  country-music  singer   Kinky  Friedman,  founder  of  The  Texas  Jewboys,  loves  to  sing  irreverent  songs  such  as  They  Ain’t  Makin  ’  Jews  Like  Jesus  Anymore.

During  World  War  II  about  30,000  Jews  fled  to  the  forests  of  Eastern  Europe  where  they  armed  themselves  and  fought  the  Nazis  and  their  collaborators.

Israel  has  only  sent  a  volleyball  team  to  the  games.  It  can  only  finish   fifth  in  the  men’s  45+  volleyball  com  petition,  having  been  defeated  ear   lier  in  the  week.   About  50,000  spectators  greeted  the  athletes,  who  range  in  age  from  24  to  99.   A  number  of  Israeli  flags  could  be  seen  flying  above  the  MCG  turf  in  a  sea  of  25,000  competitors  from  97  countries.  Athletes  draped  in  coloured  ponchos  marched  accord  ing  to  their  sport,  not  their  country.   About  200  Australian  Jews  are   taking  part  in  athletics,  tennis,  table  tennis,  weightlifting,  swimming,  soc  cer  and  basketball.

"  Jewish-Muslim  condemnation  of  suicide  bombing   Angie  Fox   MUTUAL  Muslim  and  Jewish  declarations  against  suicide  bombing  were  “major  accom  plishments”  of  the  inaugural  conference  of  the  Rabbinical  Council  of  the  Euro-Asian  Jewish  Congress,  held  in  Kazakhstan  recently.   Mizrachi  Rabbi  J  Simcha  Cohen  of  Melbourne  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  he  had  initiated  dialogue  on  the  issue  between  the  international  rabbis  and  senior  representa  tives  of  the  Muslim  leadership  at  the  confer   ence.   “I  said  I  was  willing  to  make  public  a  state  ment  that  Judaism  is  not  at  war  with  Islam  or  Muslims,”  he  said.   “Will  a  leader  of  the  Muslim  community  openly  make  such  a  statement  that  they  are  not  at  war  with  Judaism  and  the  Jews?   “Judaism  is  against  terror.  Suicide  bombings,  which  zero  in  on  innocent  civilians,  is  ghastly  and  against  everything  Judaism  stands  for.”   His  statements  were  initially  met  with  a  wall   of  silence.   But  the  following  evening,  when  the  dean  of  the  Islamic  University  of  Kazakhstan,  Murat-Haji   Rabbi  1  Simcha  Cohen   Mynbaev,  addressed  the  conference,  he  stunned  the  rabbis  by  issuing  the  following  dec   laration:   “Anyone  who  is  a  terrorist,  who  is  a  suicide  bomber,  cannot  be  called  a  Muslim,  is  not  a  reli  gious  person  and  is  definitely  in  violation  of  the   basic  tents  of  Islam.”   The  declaration  received  a  rousing  applause  from  the  40  rabbis  present.   Rabbi  Cohen  said  the  mutual  declarations  were  a  small  but  important  step  towards   mutual  tolerance.   “One  of  the  most  important  things  in  life  that  we  can  do  is  lower  the  level  of  enmity  and  increase  the  level  of  tolerance,”  he  emphasised.   Kazakhstani  President  Nursaltan  Nazzarbayev  told  the  conference  of  rabbis  —  who  came  from  more  than  a  dozen  countries,  including  France,  England  and  Israel  —  that  he  would  act  as  a  communication  channel  to  the  isolated  Iranian  Jewish  community  regarding  the  status  of  Jewish  prisoners  incarcerated  there,  as  well  as  missing  Israeli  airman  Ron   Arad.   The  delegation  also  lobbied  the  President  to  spearhead  a  gathering  of  world  Muslim  and  Jewish  leaders  in  Kazakhstan,  which  President  Nazzarbayev  said  is  willing  to  serve  as  a  bridge   between  Jews  and  Muslims.   Rabbi  Cohen  said  the  high  level  of  religious  tolerance  in  Kazakhstan,  as  well  as  the  coun  try’s  good  relations  with  Israel  and  other  Muslim  countries,  bodes  well  for  the  future.   “Maybe  from  this  country,  Kazakhstan,  will  come  a  new  peace,  a  dialogue.”   Kazakhstan’s  Jewish  community  president,  Alexander  Mashkevich,  48,  a  philanthropist  and  businessman,  funded  the  conference,  which  took  place  in  the  capital,  Astana,  as  well  as  in  the  town  of  Almaty,  where  the  grave  of  the  Late  Lubavitcher  Rebbe’s  father  is  located.   The  Euro-Asian  Jewish  Congress  was  established  in  March  this  year  in  response  to  burgeoning  Jewish  life  in  the  former  Soviet   countries.   It  comprises  delegates  from  28  nations  in  the  Far  East,  the  Pacific  region,  Australia  and  the  former  Soviet  Union.   Rabbi  Cohen,  who  also  visited  synagogues  and  met  with  members  of  Kazakhstan’s  Jewish  communities  —  estimated  at  some  where  between  7000  and  20,000  out  a  toted  population  of  15  million  —  said  Jewish  life  there  was  “becoming  vibrant”.   “It’s  like  a  return  to  Judaism,”  he  said.  “People  are  learning  as  much  as  they  can.”   H  Renaissance  in  the  Urals,  page  17 ",2002-12-06
"  Jewish  history  lessons  though  letters   Letters  to  Auntie  Fori:  The  5000-year  history  of  the  Jewish  people  and  their  faith   Martin  Gilbert   Weidenfeld  &amp;  Nicolson,  2002,  460  pages,  $49.95   Reviewed  by  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Cohen   THE  name  Martin  Gilbert  conjures  up  one  of  the  great  historians  of  the  late  20th-century  whose  work  includes  being  the  official  historian  for  the  biography  of  Winston  Churchill,  writing  six  of  the  10  volumes  so  far  published.   He  is  also  well  known  for  his  work  on  atlases  depicting  Jewish  history  as  well  as  books  on  the  Holocaust.   Letters  to  Auntie  Fori  is  a  very  different  book.  In  1998,  Gilbert’s  90-year-old  friend  Mrs  B  K  Nehru,  whom  he  knew  as  Auntie  Fori,  revealed  a  secret  to  him  that  she  was  not  Indian  Hindu  at  all  but  a  Jew.   She  asked  him  to  recommend  a  short  history  of  the  Jews.  Instead  of  turning  to  many  of  the  classic  texts  of  Jewish  history,  Gilbert  decided  to  write  it  for  her.  He  employed  a  different  device  for  retelling  the  history  in  the  form  of  weekly  letters  which  form  this  book.   To  set  the  tone,  each  section  features  an  airmail  envelope  with  cancelled  stamps.  Perhaps  these  were  the  original  envelopes  used  by  Gilbert  to  send  these  letters  halfway  across  the  world.   In  writing  the  book,  Gilbert  says  that  “my  hope  was  that  the  Jewish  story,  despite  its  moments  of  sadness,  internal  divisions,  war  and  —  sometimes  terrible  suffering  —  would  reveal  the  tenacity  of  her  peo   pie’s  survival  and  achievement,  its  communal  life  and  creativity,  and  the  attempt  by  each  generation  to  follow  the  advice  which  Moses  trans  mitted”.   Each  letter  is  a  concise,  individu  ally  formed  story.  It  begins  with  Adam  and  Eve,  continues  with  Abraham’s  journey  from  Mesopotamia  to  Canaan,  and  covers  all  the  great  events  of  Jewish  history  including  the  journey  to  and  from  Egypt,  Moses  and  the  Ten   Commandments.   It  continues  with  the  Israelites   entering  the  promised  land,  the  king   doms  of  David  and  Solomon  and  the  exile  to  Babylon  and  the  destruction  of  Jewish  independence  and  on  through  the  ancient  and  medieval  periods  highlighting  the  creativity,  suffering  and  achievement  of  mod   ern  times.   The  book  ranges  through  almost  every  land  including  China  and  India.   Gilbert  maintains  an  internal  struc  ture  with  a  chronological  consisten  cy  as  well  as  weaving  in  the  history  of  other  peoples  and  faiths.   Since  Jewish  history  is  not  played   out  in  a  vacuum  the  book  ensures   that  the  reader,  beginning  with  Auntie  Fori,  appreciates  the  larger  stage  upon  which  Jewish  history  has  played  a  part.   ""Each  letter  is  a  concise,  individually  formed  story.   It  begins  with  Adam  and  Eve,   continues  with  Abraham’s  journey  from  Mesopotamia   to  Canaan,  and  covers  all  the  great  events  of   Jewish  history.""   The  last  group  of  letters  focus  on  Judaism  including  its  traditions  and  customs,  its  rites  and  rituals  (including  some  of  the  variations  between  communities)  as  well  as  other  aspects  of  Jewish  history  and  faith.   In  reading  this  book  there  is  always  the  sense  that  this  was  writ  ten  by  one  friend  to  another.  It  is  a  wonderful,  readable  introduction  to  Jewish  history  and  faith  which  brings  to  life  the  events  and  sequence  of  Jewish  history  with  a  special  charm  which  will  open  up  Jewish  history  to  both  the  young  and  the  old,  the  seeker  and  the  read  er  with  some  knowledge.

"  Jewish  Michael  Jordan  signs  with  Maccabi  TA   NoahS&amp;nea   ORTHODOX  Jewish  basketball  star  Tamir  Goodman  has  signed  a  three-year  deal  with   Maccabi  Tel  Aviv.   “The  first  thing  that  came  to  my  mind  was  Baruch  HashemGoodman,  20,  told  the  Balti  more  Jewish  Times.   “There’s  no  other  way  to  look  at  it.  Without  Hashem’s  blessing,  this  never  would  have  hap  pened.  Everyone  has  a  special  talent  in  the  world.  With  me,  it  is  basketball.   “Whatever  your  talent  is,  it  is  your  job  to  develop  it  and  bring  Godliness  to  it.  I’ve  had  a  lot  of  ups  and  downs,  but  it  is  so  clear  to  me  what  Hashem  has  given  me  the  opportunity  to   do.”   “I’m  not  an  amazing  person,”  he  said.  “I’m  just  following  God’s  plan.”   Although  the  terms  of  the  deal  were  not  dis  closed,  Steven  Heumann,  Goodman’s  attorney  and  friend,  said  “there  is  a  clause  in  his  contract  that  he  is  not  required  to  participate  in  team  activities  that  require  him  to  desecrate  the  Shabhat  or  any  other  Jewish  holiday.”   Heumann  said  there  is  a  chance  that  Good  man  will  be  loaned  to  Hapoel  Galil  Elyon  to  give  him  more  playing  time.   Goodman  has  made  several  previous  trips  to  Israel,  often  putting  on  basketball  demon  strations,  as  well  as  delivering  discussions  on  the  weekly  Torah  portion.   “I’ve  always  wanted  to  play  in  Israel  and  be  in  my  country,”  Goodman  said.  “My  mother  would  always  tell  me  how  important  it  was  to  her  when  she  grew  up  in  Israel.”   Goodman  burst  onto  the  scene  in  1998  at  the  Yeshiva  University  Red  Sarachek  High  School  Basketball  Tournament  —  a  national  basketball  competition  with  teams  from  Ameri  can  and  Canadian  Jewish  high  schools.   He  led  the  Talmudic  Academy  of  Baltimore  to  a  third-place  finish  and  made  the  all-tourna  ment  team  at  age  16.   The  following  year,  he  piqued  the  interest  of  college  scouts,  averaging  35.4  points  per  game   in  Baltimore’s  high  school  league.  Later  that  year  he  was  offered  a  basketball  scholarship  to  the  University  of  Maryland,  which  won  this  year’s  NCAA  championship.   Goodman  declined  the  offer,  citing  an  inabil  ity  on  the  university’s  part  to  accommodate  his  Shabbat  observance  with  the  team’s  schedule.   The  possibility  of  an  Orthodox  Jew  playing  Division  I  basketball  turned  Goodman  into  a  media  sensation  and  prompted  60  Minutes,  ESPN  and  Sports  Illustrated  to  cover  his  story  in  depth.   He  became  known  as  the  “Jewish  Michael  Jordan”.   Goodman  later  accepted  a  scholarship  to  play  at  Towson  University  near  Baltimore  and  started  for  much  of  his  freshman  year  in  2000  2001.  He  missed  one  game  last  year  because  it  fell  on  a  Friday  night.   He  left  the  Towson  Tigers  after  an  incident  in  which  he  claimed  the  coach  threw  a  chair  at  him  in  the  locker-room  after  a  game.  He  had  played  seven  games  and  averaged  only  1.9  points.   Goodman  and  his  family  wanted  the  univer  sity  to  discipline  the  coach,  but  it  refused.  The  guard  then  left  the  team,  but  finished  his  class  es  in  the  spring.   At  the  time,  he  told  the  Jerusalem  Post.  “If  anything  positive  comes  out  of  this,  I  hope  that  I’ve  cleared  the  way  for  another  [observant]  Jewish  player  to  play  Division  I  basketball.”   Since  December,  rumours  have  been  circu  lating  that  Israeli  teams  were  interested  in  hav  ing  him  play  in  the  country.  The  Baltimore  Sun  reported  in  February  that  Maccabi  Tel  Aviv  and  Hapoel  Jerusalem  had  expressed  interest  in   him  and  wanted  to  strike  a  deal.   Maccabi  Tel  Aviv,  Israel’s  most  popular  team,  plays  in  three  leagues  and  for  a  long  time  has  been  one  of  the  better  teams  on  the  Euro  pean  basketball  circuit.  Goodman,  who  stands  1.91  metres  tall,  is  expected  to  arrive  in  Israel  within  the  next  month  to  begin  practice  with   his  new  team.

"  Travel,  Jewish-style   Title:   Jewish  Travel  Guide  2002   Editor:  Michael  Zaidner   Publisher:  Vallentme  Mitchell,   410  pp,  $39.95   Reviewer:  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Cohen   WHEN  Jews  travel,  they  often  seek  out   Jewish  places  to  visit.  Some  are  looking  for  a  synagogue,  others  want  to  eat  something  Jewish  (and  perhaps  local),  while  some  feel  the  need  to  identify  just  by  knowing  that  Jewish  communities  can  be  found  from  Iquique,  Chile,  to  Anchorage,  Alaska,  and  almost  anywhere  in   between.   A  version  of  the  Jewish  Travel  Guide  has  been  in  existence  since  before  I  can  remem  ber.  It  had  a  makeover  five  years  ago,  and  ever  since  I  have  found  it  less  informative  at  some  levels  than  it  was  before.   Perhaps  those  with  some  knowledge  become  “picky”  about  its  shortcomings  and  failures  precisely  because  it  does  the  basic  job  well.   With  regard  to  the  section  on  Australia,  a  number  of  issues  have  been  raised  with  the   publisher  in  the  past.  I  am  sure  that  Sydney’s  Temple  Emanuel  would  be  surprised  to  see  itself  listed  only  as  a  Conservative  syna  gogue,  while  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel  is   described  as  “Liberal”.   In  considering  the  entry  for  Canberra,  I  would  not  know  whether  the  services  are  Orthodox  or  Liberal  (when  in  fact  both  options  are  available  in  the  same  building).   Having  spent  15  years  in  St  Louis,  Missouri,  in  the  American  Mid-West,  I  know  it  has  60,000  Jews,  so  I  was  more  than  a  little  surprised  to  see  only  one  synagogue  listed  (which,  by  coincidence,  is  the  one  I  attend   when  I  visit).   And  Fort  Leavenworth  is  listed  as  being  in  the  same  state  as  St  Louis,  when,  in  fact,  it  is   in  Kansas.   The  listings  for  many  cities  did  not  include  mention  of  a  Jewish  newspaper,  which  is  often  a  great  source  of  information  about  a  community.  Was  that  an  error  of  omission  or  commission,  for  the  Jewish  Travel  Guide  is   published  in  conjunction  with  the  London   Jewish  Chronicle?   Jewish  newspaper  details  would  be  more  useful  to  most  travellers  than  a  list  of  kosher  butchers.   Part  of  the  problem  in  putting  together  such  a  guide  is  that  a  long  lead-time  is  required.  Businesses,  particularly  restau  rants,  come  and  go.  The  reader  must  accept  this,  and  it  is  necessary  to  check  with  locals  in  the  know  about  the  latest  changes.   For  the  next  edition,  I  hope  the  editor  and  publisher  consider  including  website  addresses  at  the  beginning  of  the  entry  for  each  town.  Communities  often  update  their  website  information  long  before  they  change  any  other  source  of  information.   One  small  item  brought  a  smile  to  my  face:  for  some  reason,  synagogues  under  Chabad  leadership  are  always  listed  apart  from  their  Orthodox  counterparts.   This  is  a  useful  book  to  take  on  your  trav  els.  But  remember  —  it  is  a  guide,  not  a  bible! ",2002-03-29
"  Enemy  within:  Israeli  Arabs  or  Jewish  insensitivity?   VIEWPOINT   LettyCottin   Pogrebin   JEWS  know  what  it’s  like  to  be  a   stigmatised  minority,  singled  out  for  mistreatment  or  viewed  suspiciously.   In  the  US,  the  singling-out  has  taken  many  forms,  from  antisemitic  harangues  in  the  1940s,  to  the  Red   Scare  of  the  ’50s  when  commenta   tors  suggested  the  Rosenbergs  were  the  tip  of  the  iceberg  of  Jewish  sub  version,  through  decades  when  Jew  ish  quotas  limited  our  access  to  jobs   and  universities.   Such  experiences  —  if  not  basic  decency  —  should  make  every  Jew  super-sensitive  to  the  evils  of  sec  ond-class  citizenship.   Yet  many  of  us  have  remained  wilfully  ignorant  or  disgracefully  silent  about  the  marginalisation  of  the  Arab  citizens  of  Israel,  the  one  million  Muslim  Arabs,  Druze,  Bedouins  and  Christian  Arabs  who  constitute  nearly  20  per  cent  of  the  state  (Jews  constitute  only  2.5  per  cent  of  America).   Some  would  argue  that  Israeli  Arabs  can’t  be  compared  to  Ameri  can  Jews  because,  given  their  identi  fication  with  the  Palestinian  cause,  Arab  citizens  of  Israel  threaten  to  become  a  fifth  column,  “the  enemy  within”.   But  how  different  is  that  notion   from  the  charge  of  “dual  loyalty”  unfairly  levelled  against  Jews  in  other  countries?   During  the  oil  crisis  of  the  70s,  bumper  stickers  said  “If  you’re  wait  ing  in  line  for  gas,  blame  the  Jews”.  In  1991  Pat  Buchanan,  a  leader  of  the  Christian  Right,  claimed  that  Israel’s  “Amen  Corner”  (the  US  Jewish  lobby)  got  the  US  into  the  Gulf  War.   And  after  September  11,  some  blamed  the  attacks  on  America’s  pro-Israel  policies,  which  were  attributed  to  Jewish  pressure  on   government.  Not  only  did  we  feel  scapegoated  at  a  moment  of  national  pain,  we  also  found  ourselves  having  to  answer  bizarre  rumours  that  Israel  was  behind  the  tragedies.   Just  as  you  are  capable  of  being  a  loyal  Australian  and  a  Jew  who  iden  tifies  with  Israel,  Arab  Israelis  deserve  a  comparable  assumption  about  their  multiple  identities.   Most  Arab  citizens  see  their  future  tied  to  Israel.  Most  have  adopted  Hebrew  as  a  second  lan  guage  and  participate  in  Israeli  cul  ture  to  some  extent.  During  Israel’s  wars,  none  engaged  in  acts  of  sabo  tage  or  disloyalty.  In  fact,  some  vol  unteered  to  take  over  civilian  duties.   Until  recently,  Arab  Israelis  par  ticipated  in  elections,  comprising  more  than  10  per  cent  of  Israeli  vot  ers.  About  97  per  cent  voted  for  Ehud  Barak  in  1999.   They  are  sufficiently  integrated  into  Israeli  society  so  that  an  Arab  woman  from  Haifa  was  chosen  Miss  Israel,  an  Arab  sits  on  Israel’s  Supreme  Court,  a  Druze  is  a  govern  ment  minister  and  there  are  10  Arab  Members  of  Knesset.   Many  Arab  citizens  take  issue  with  Israel’s  being  a  Jewish  state;  by  definition,  a  Jewish  state  disadvan  tages  non-Jews.   According  to  Adalah,  an  Arab  rights  organisation,  about  20  laws  provide  unequal  rights  and  obliga  tions  based  on  “nationality”,  which  in  Israel  means  religion.  (Every  Israeli  must  carry  an  identity  card  that  identifies  him  or  her  as  a  Jew,  Muslim  or  Christian.)  As  Arab  MK  Ahmed  Tibi  put  it,  “Israel  is  a  demo   cratic  state  for  the  Jews,  and  a  Jew  ish  state  for  the  Arabs”.   The  climate  is  ripe  for  Arab  citi  zens  to  move  from  alienation  to  soli  darity  with  Palestinians  and  hostility  toward  Israel  since  the  government  has  done  so  little  to  equalise  their  conditions  or  inspire  patriotism  in  its  Arab  minority.   “Just  as  you  are  capable  of  being  a  loyal  Australian  and  a  Jew  who  identifies  with  Israel,   Arab  Israelis  deserve  a  comparable  assumption  about  their  identities.”   Infant  mortality  is  twice  as  high  among  Arabs  as  Jews.  Their  per  capi  ta  income  is  half  that  of  Jews.  Twice  as  many  Arabs  live  below  the  pover  ty  line.  Their  municipalities  have  received  one-third  less  government  funding  than  Jewish  areas.  The  Edu  cation  Ministry  spends  half  as  much  per  Arab  child  as  per  Jewish  child.   Half  as  many  Arabs  as  Jews  have  13  or  more  years  of  school.   Israeli  Arabs  are  under-represent  ed  in  higher  education  and  most  industries.  They  make  up  less  than  six  per  cent  of  the  civil  service.  Their  unemployment  rate  is  estimated  at  40  per  cent.  Since  1975,  the  govern  ment  has  built  one  Arab  housing  unit  for  every  337  units  built  for  Jews   By  law,  93  per  cent  of  Israeli  land  can  be  leased  or  owned  only  by  Jews  or  Jewish  agencies.  Since  1948,  the  Arab  population  has  grown  from  150,000  to  almost  one  million,  yet  76  per  cent  of  their  land  has  been  con  fiscated,  and  no  government  has  cre  ated  even  one  new  Arab  town.   Despite  the  Israeli  Declaration  of  Independence  guaranteeing  “com  plete  equality  of  social  and  political  rights  to  all  its  inhabitants”,  the  gap  between  promise  and  fulfilment  is   vast.   Some  feel  Arabs  deserve  no  bet  ter  because  of  their  fifth-column  behaviour,  pointing  to  MK  Tibi,  who  refused  to  sing  Hatikva  at  his  swear  ing-in  (but  did  recite  the  loyalty  oath),  and  MK  Azmi  Bishara,  who   called  for  Arab  resistance  against  Israel  while  praising  Hezbollah  for  its  “heroism”  (Bishara  has  since  been  indicted  for  supporting  terror).   Haifa  University  sociologist  '""  Sammy  Smooha  noted  a  trend  of   “Israelisation”  and  moderation   among  Arab  citizens  from  1976  to  1995.  By  1999,  he  found  growing   extremism.   “Government  policy  is  important  in  shaping  these  attitudes,”  he  said.  “Since  1995,  improving  conditions  in  the  Arab  sector  has  become  a  lower   priority  for  the  government;  this   feeds  radicalisation.  The  Arabs  in  this  country  are  not  living  in  a  vacu  um.  How  we  treat  them  makes  them  feel  more  and  more  alienated.”   The  integration  of  Arabs  into  Israeli  society  has  suffered  setbacks,  not  only  because  of  violent  acts,  but  also  because  of  the  unravelling  peace  process  and  increasing  sym  pathy  for  Palestinian  aspirations.   (Givat  Haviva’s  Institute  For  Peace  reports  that  five  years  ago,  27  per  cent  of  Arab  citizens  identified  as  “Palestinians  living  in  Israel”;  today  67  per  cent  self-define  that  way.)   MK  Avraham  Burg  has  suggested  that  Diaspora  Jews  fund  programs  fostering  understanding  between  Israel’s  Jews  and  Arabs  because  the  state’s  existence  depends  on  the  two  groups’  amicable  co-existence.   Arab  citizens  are  more  likely  to  act  like  Israelis  if  they  are  treated  like  Israelis.  The  Jewish  state  has  the  power  to  equalise  their  status.  And  Jews  in  the  Diaspora  have  the  power  to  help  through  dollars  and  vocal  support  of  such  efforts.  What  is  at  stake  is  Israeli  democracy  and  the  integrity  of  Israeli  citizenship.   ■  Letty  Cottin  Pogrebin  is  founding   editor  of  Ms. ",2002-01-25

Alton  Lee   AMONG  the  myriad  of  ethnic  groups,  Jews  would  appreciate  Turkish  friend  ship  the  most,  Turkish  Ambassador   to  Australia  Tansu  Okandan  believes.   Addressing  the  NSW  Association  of  Jewish  Ex-Servicemen  and  Women’s  annual  Anzac  Day  service,  the  ambassador  warmly  recollected  his  lifelong  relationship  with  the  Jewish  people.   “The  spiritual  and  social  atmos  phere  of  a  synagogue  is  not  alien  to  me,”  he  said;  his  mother  was  a  histo  ry  teacher  at  Istanbul’s  Jewish  high  school,  and  he  attended  many  mar  riage  ceremonies  and  spiritual  meet  ings  at  the  Istanbul  synagogue  during  his  youth.   Held  at  the  Great  Synagogue,  the  service  was  attended  by  600  com  munity  members  and  dignitaries,  including  NSW  Governor  Marie  Bashir  and  her  husband,  Sir  Nicholas  Shehadie.   Mr  Okandan’s  presence  was  a  his  toric  precedent  —  the  first  time  a  Turkish  ambassador  had  attended  an  Anzac  Day  ceremony  in  Australia.   “Jews  have  been  a  part  of  Turkish  society  for  almost  700  years,”  Mr  Okandan  said.  The  Ottoman  Sultans  encouraged  Jews  fleeing  European  persecution  in  the  14th  and  15th  cen  turies  to  settle  in  Turkey,  and  the  modern  state  was  also  a  haven  for  Jews  during  the  Holocaust,  with  Jew  ish  scientists  and  professors  fleeing  to  Turkey  from  Nazi  Germany  at   Istanbul’s  invitation.   Celebrating  the  Jewish  contribu  tion  to  the  modern  Turkish  republic,  he  said  Jews  had  played  an  impor  tant  part  in  all  facets  of  Turkish  life  and  described  present-day  Turkish  Jews  as  “extremely  comfortable  with   their  lives”.   Referring  to  Turkish-Australian  relations,  the  ambassador  said  Anzac  Day  held  a  special  signifi  cance  for  Turks  as  well:  while  Aus  tralia’s  national  identity  had  been  shaped  by  the  landing  at  Gallipoli,  Turkey’s  successful  repulsion  of  the  attack  had  been  nation-forming  for   Turks.   In  spite  of  the  large  loss  of  life  on  both  sides,  a  bond  of  friendship  had  developed  between  the  two  peoples,  to  the  extent  that  the  Gallipoli  penin  sula  was  renamed  Anzac  Cove  in  1985.  After  centuries  of  attempted  invasions,  only  the  Anzacs  had  been   so  honoured.   In  a  sober  message,  Rabbi  Ray  mond  Apple,  Senior  Rabbi  to  the  Australian  Defence  Force,  alluded  to  the  record  level  of  local  antisemitic  attacks  and  to  the  conflict  in  the  Mid  dle  East.   “Anazc  Day  is  never  the  same  because  history  never  stands  still.  We  talk  of  1915,  but  we  are  exercised  by  the  problems  of  a  much  later  gen   eration.   “War  is  about  enemies,  peace  is  about  friends;  but  this  year  we  are  no  longer  sure  who  is  our  enemy  and   who  is  our  friend.   “People  whom  we  were  speaking  to  not  so  long  ago  are  now  on  the   other  side  of  the  fence.  People  we  were  not  speaking  to  a  little  while  ago  now  sit  at  the  table  with  us  as  friends,  and  we  find  much  in  common.”   Referring  to  the  biblical  injunc  tion  on  dealing  with  one’s  enemies,  Rabbi  Apple  said  helping,  rather  than  killing,  was  the  solution,  while  friends  should  be  treated  according  to  the  requirement  to  “love  your  neighbour  as  yourself’.   Pointedly  ambiguous,  he  added:  “Perhaps  what  I  have  said  about  ene  mies  bears  on  the  tense  Middle  East;  perhaps  my  remarks  about  friends  relate  to  an  Australia  which  is  losing  the  art  of  a  fair  go.

"  ffl  International   Rachel  Pomerance   NEW  YORK  —  An  initiative  seeking  compensation  for  Jews  forced  to  flee  Arab  countries  during  the  creation  of  the  State  of  Israel  is  gaining  steam.   Justice  for  Jews  From  Arab  Countries  was  launched  on  Monday  to  publicise  the  “historical  truth”  of  Jewish  refugees  from  Arab  coun  tries,  the  former  US  ambassador  to  the  United  Nations,  Richard  Holbrooke,  said.   The  group  claims  that  roughly  865,000  Jews  were  forced  to  flee  Arab  and  Muslim  lands  because  of  hostility  surrounding  the  formation  of  the  State  of  Israel.   That’s  more  than  the  number  of  Palestinian  refugees  —  some  750,000  —  who  fled  or  were  expelled  from  Israel  during  the  1948  War  of  Independence.   Many  of  the  Jewish  refugees  were  stripped  of  their  property  when  they  fled.  The  issue  of  Jewish  refugees  from  Arab  countries  has  been  swept  under  the  “Persian  carpet”,  joked  Holbrooke,  who  is  an  honorary  chairman  of  the  new  organisation,  along  with  Lord  George  Weidenfeld  of  Great  Britain’s  House  of  Lords.   Also  taking  leadership  roles  are  Canadian  legislator  and  human  rights  lawyer  Irwin  Cotier  and  for  mer  Knesset  speaker  Shlomo  Hillel,  who  helped  some  100,000  Jews  leave  Iraq  just  after  Israel’s  War  of  Independence.   The  new  group  was  created  by  the  Conference  of  Presidents  of  Major  American  Jewish  Organisations,  the  American  Sephardi  Federation  and  the  World  Jewish  Congress.   The  coalition  seeks  “redress”  for  Jews  displaced  from  Arab  lands.  Exactly  what  form  that  will  take   should  be  determined  in  Israeli  Palestinian  peace  talks,  the  group   says.   “We  don’t  want  to  prejudice  the  outcome.  If  the  Palestinians  will  be  getting  financial  restitution,  then  we  believe  Jewish  refugees  will  be  get  ting  financial  restitution,”  said  Stanley  Urman,  the  director  of  the  Washington-based  Centre  for  Middle  East  Peace  and  the  co-ordinator  of  the  new  group.   “We  want  to  make  sure  that  every  time  the  issue  of  refugees  is  dis  cussed  within  the  context  of  the  Middle  East  peace  process,  then  the  rights  of  former  Jewish  refugees  will  also  be  addressed,”  he  said.  “We’re  just  saying  this  issue  must  be  dealt  with  appropriately,  both  as  a  matter  of  law  and  a  matter  of  equity.”   “If  the  Palestinians  will  be  getting  financial  restitution,   then  we  believe  Jewish  refugees  will  be  getting   financial  restitution.”   Stanley  Urman,  director,  Centre  for  Middle  East  Peace   The  group  said  it  plans  to  coordi  nate  a  campaign  to  collect  claims  from  Jewish  refugees,  develop  a  legal  committee  to  document  such  claims,  lobby  heads  of  state  and  international  bodies,  mobilise  Jewish  communal  support  and  back  a  public  education  project.   The  birth  of  the  new  coalition  comes  five  months  after  Israeli  Justice  Minister  Meir  Sheetrit  announced  that  his  ministry  was   American,  British  and  Israeli  dignitaries  launch  Justice  for  Jews  from  Arab  eoumnes   on  Monday.  Photo:  Conference  of  Presidents   preserving  and  computerising  more  than  10,000  claims  from  previous  compensation  initiatives  that  had   been  abandoned.   The  ministry  has  partnered  with  the  Sephardi  Federation,  which  has  been  publicising  the  effort  and  seek  ing  new  claims  from  Jews  around  the   world.   The  ministry’s  goal  is  to  gather  information  on  Jewish  property  in  Arab  states  to  counter  Palestinian  claims  to  lost  property  in  future  nego  tiations,  Sheetrit  told  JTA  in  June.   Most  of  the  Jewish  refugees  from  Arab  lands  moved  to  Israel,  where  the  nascent  state  undertook  a  mas  sive  effort  to  absorb  and  settle  them.  Today  they  and  their  descendants  make  up  about  half  of  Israel’s  Jewish  population.   In  contrast,  Arab  states  largely  refused  to  settle  Palestinian  refugees,  denying  them  citizenship  and  forcing  them  into  squalid  camps  to  keep  the  conflict  with   Israel  alive.   Israeli  and  Jewish  leaders  believe  that  any  final  agreement  with  the  Palestinians  will  include  financial  compensation  for  Palestinian  refugees.  But  they  reject  the  idea  that  refugees  and  their  descendants  be  allowed  to  return  to  Israel,  seeing  it  as  tantamount  to  the  demographic  destruction  of  Israel.   Palestinian  leaders,  however,  continue  to  insist  on  the  right  of  return.  The  issue  was  a  main  factor  in  the  collapse  of  the  July  2000  Camp  David  summit  and  subsequent  peace   talks.   JIA ",2002-10-04
"  Seasons  of  the  Jewish  year   Title:  The  Eternal  Journey  -   Meditations  on  the  Jewish  Year   Author:  Jonathan  Wittenberg   Publisher:  Joseph  s  tsooKstore   Reviewer.  Juay  Lasn  ssaimt   IT  is  often  easy  to  pinpoint  in  a  book  writ   ten  by  a  rabbi  whether  the  author  is  Reform,  Reconstructionist,  Conservative  »~  or  Orthodox.  Generally,  only  those  who   identify  with  the  writer’s  stream  of  Judaism   read  the  book.   That’s  not  the  case  with  Rabbi  Jonathan  Wittenberg’s  work,  which  invites  the  reader  to  share  his  explorations  of  the  seasons  of  the  Jewish  year.   This  is  not  to  suggest  that  Wittenberg,  spiritual  leader  of  the  New  North  London  Synagogue,  a  Masorti  congregation,  will  be  appreciated  by  everyone.   “We  get  the  impression  of  a  father  struggling  to  convey  to  his  children   the  beauty  of  Judaism  in  a  loving  way.   His  childhood  memories  about   Chanukah  are  poignant.  His  mother   died  when  he  was  five;  one  of  the  few  recollections  he  has  is  as  she  tapers   down  the  candles  to  make  them  fit   the  tiny  chanukiah  she  has   given  him.""   This  is  not  a  “how  to”  guide  to  the  Jewish  holidays.  Wittenberg,  a  Scottish-born  son  of  German  Jewish  refugees  with  rabbinic  for  bears,  studied  literature  at  Cambridge  and  displays  an  enchantment  with  the  natural  world  by  recalling  meaningful  Jewish  holi  *  day  experiences  celebrated  through  nature.

We  get  the  impression  of  a  father  strug   gling  to  convey  to  his  children  the  beauty  of  Judaism  in  a  loving  way.  His  childhood  memories  about  Chanukah  are  poignant.

Wittenberg  is  a  liberal.  He  quotes  Anne  Frank:  “I  still  believe  that  people  are  really  good  at  heart.”  He  is  also  politically  correct:  “In  situations  of  conflict  it  is  often  women  who  lead  the  way  to  the  appreciation  that  the  enemy  are  people  too.”   Trying  to  analyse  the  cause  of  Israel’s  trouble  with  its  neighbours  from  his  perch  in  London,  he  writes  of  “the  inevitable  wrongs  of  the  Israeli  occupation,  bound  to  involve  violence;  the  dangerous  mixture  of  theology  and  nationalism  that  created  an  expansion  ist  and  messianic  Judaism.   Like  many  Jews,  he  concludes,  after  list  ing  Islamic  fundamentalist  hatred,  “I  often  cannot  tell  with  what  or  with  whom  I  feel  most  angry.”   Talking  about  the  victims  of  the  violence,  Wittenberg  borders  on  moral  relativism:  “Of   course  we  care  most  for  our  own.  But  we  should  remember  that  beyond  our  differen  tiation  of  them  into  ‘our  dead’  and  ‘their  dead’,  the  dead  are  simply  all  dead  together.  And  beyond  ‘our  land’  and  ‘their  land’  and  ‘our  peace’  and  ‘their  peace’,  one  hopes  that  one  day  there  will  simply  be  peace.”   Sometimes  the  beauty  of  his  prose  masks  just  how  disconnected  he  is  from  the  reali  ties  of  Israeli  life.  What  is  one  to  make  of  the  following:  “We  have  to  continue  to  believe  that  Jerusalem  will  be  the  city  that  brings  faiths  and  peoples  together,  that  one  day  a  Jew  will  be  able  to  recite  the  Koran  in  a  mosque  and  a  Moslem  the  Torah  in  a  syna  gogue  and  no-one  will  kill  them,  because  everyone  will  recognise  that  we  pray  to  the   same  God.”   Yet  the  book  should  not  be  judged  solely  by  Wittenberg’s  penchant  for  applying  “new  age”  ideas  to  the  Arab-Israel  conflict.   He  is  not  only  a  gifted  writer,  he  is  also  a  beloved  rabbi  who  has  brought  many  unaf  filiated  London  Jews  closer  to  their  tradi  tion.   ■  Judy  Lash  Balint  is  a  book  reviewer  for  the   Jerusalem  Post.

"  VIEWPOINT   WHEN  the  horror  of  the  Sep   tember  11  attack  happened  in  America,  the  United  States  immediately  attacked  Afghanistan  with  all  its  might.  There  were  no  Jews  in  the  US  who  proudly  called  themselves  “leftist”  on  the  subject.   If  you  heard  one  Hollywood  drenched  extremist  liberal  who  protested  America’s  super-bombs  over  Afghanistan,  he  was  immedi  ately  drowned  out  as  a  maniac,  a  spy  or  a  traitor.   Why  is  it  that  when  Israel  suffers  the  loss  of  hundreds  of  innocent  lives  on  a  daily  basis,  Jews  all  over  the  world  suddenly  become  divided  between  “left”  and  “right”?   What  is  the  sickness  that  these  leftist  Jews  suffer  from?  What  kind  of  mental  paralysis  or  perversion  cre  ates  such  warped  behaviour?   The  same  qualities  that  have  made  the  Jews  the  greatest  humani  tarians  in  history  ironically  have  made  us  the  world’s  easiest  victims.   We  feel  so  uncomfortable  about  the  thought  of  hurting  anybody  that  even  if  a  suicide  bomber  could  be  hurt  while  killing  100  Jews,  there  are  thousands  of  Jewish  “leftists”  who  are  convinced  that  it  is  our  own  fault.  Somehow  if  we  were  compas  sionate  enough,  we  would  find  a  way  to  solve  the  problem  without  mak  ing  a  murderer  suffer  just  because  his  only  crime  is  killing  Jewish  peo  ple.   This  historically  profound  Jewish  “guilt  trip”  has  turned  the  most  intel  lectual  Jews  into  idiots.  If  the  vio  lence  committed  against  the  Israelis  was  happening  to  any  other  people,  is  it  conceivable  that  the  same  leftist  Jews  would  be  justifying  it?   Hypothetically,  if  Canada  sent  suicide  bombers  into  America,  wan   tonly  killing  people,  would  Jewish  university  professors’  brains  calcify  enough  to  justify  it?   Somehow,  only  when  Jews  are  involved,  the  “guilt  trip”  creates  a  vacuum  in  the  brain  in  which  no  form  of  reason  could  exist.  They’ll  create  any  fantasy  to  blame  Israel.   “It’s  our  own  fault  you  can’t  occu  py  another  country  for  so  long  with  out  suffering  the  consequences”  is  the  most  sickening  of  the  “leftist”  perversions  of  reality.  This  proves  that  the  same  Jews  who  read  enough  to  hold  Ph.Ds  in  ancient  his  tory  are  somehow  incapable  of  ever   reading  a  newspaper.   The  problem  is  not  that  they  don’t  know  the  truth;  the  problem  is  that  Jews  don’t  want  to  hear  or  see  the  truth.

Because  if  they  didn’t  suffer  from  an  uncontrollable  need  to  blame  other  Jews,  they  would  find  it  impos  sible  to  ignore  what  every  breathing  person  knows:  that  Ehud  Barak  offered  the  Palestinians  98  per  cent  of  their  land  back  and  that  the  pleasure  of  having  their  own  home  meant  nothing  to  them  compared  to  the  thrill  of  killing  our  people.   This  same  kind  of  Jewish  guilt  seems  even  to  have  paralysed  the  minds  of  the  Israelis.  Otherwise,  why  did  it  take  so  long  for  succes  sive  governments  of  Israel  to  see  through  the  fraudulent  charade  of   Yasser  Arafat?   Through  all  the  years  that  he  was   a  partner  in  crime,  we  blindly  chose  to  see  him  as  a  partner  for  peace.  How  many  times  did  Israeli  prime  ministers  travel  the  world  for  peace  conferences  with  Arafat  while  he  was  masterminding  the  murder  of  our  own  people  in  Israel?   Why  did  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America,  George  W  Bush,  stop  talking  to  Arafat  while  the  heads  of  our  country  still  won  der  and  waiver  and  flounder  about  his  usefulness  to  the  peace  process?   Why  did  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  suffer  the  rejection  of  the  Israelis  for  so  many  years  while  being  vilified  as  a  “hardliner”  or  even  a  “warmonger”?   And  why  are  there  so  many  Israelis  who  even  now  accept  the  antisemitic  attacks  on  the  part  of  Europeans  accusing  Sharon  of  undermining  the  “peace  process”  by  viciously  “going  too  far”?   The  answer  is  that  the  real  “war   mongers”  are  the  so-called  “peaceniks”.  The  best  way  to  lose  Jewish  lives  needlessly  is  to  be  so  blinded  by  Jewish  guilt  that  you  can’t  see  a  murderer  for  what  he  is.  He  came  to  kill,  and  he  doesn’t  deserve  conversation.  He  deserves  elimination.   ■  Jackie  Mason  is  a  US  comedian  and  newspaper  columnist. ",2002-11-22
"  Jewish  values  and  the  future   Judaism  and  Global  Survival   Richard  H  Schwartz   Lantern  Books,  2002,  264  pages,  $49.95   Reviewed  by  Shalom  Freedman   RICHARD  Schwartz,  an  Orthodox  Jew  and  professor  emeritus  of  math  ematics  at  New  York’s  College  of  Staten  Island,  is  the  dean  of  Jewish  vegetarians.  In  Judaism  and  Global  Survival,  he  has  written  a  remark  able  short  treatise  arguing  that  Jewish  values  can  provide  a  key  to  confronting  the  ecological  crises  facing  earth.   In  his  opening  three  chapters,  Schwartz  uses  biblical  and  midrashic  sources  to  persuade  us  that  normative  Judaism  requires  the  individual  to  protest  against  social  injustice  and  to  be  concerned  with  human  rights  and  obligations.   Schwartz  maintains  that  since  we   were  created  in  the  image  of  God,  humans  have  an  obligation  to  cre  ativity  and  the  completion  of  the  Creator’s  work.  This  idea  follows  a  modem  Orthodox  theology  associat  ed  with  Rabbi  Joseph  Soloveitchik  and  his  disciples  Shlomo  Riskin,  Shubert  Spero,  David  Hartman,  Aharon  Rakeffet  and  Yaakov  Fogelman.  The  Jewish  way  in  the  face  of  evil,  according  to  Schwartz,  is  not  the  passive  resignation  espoused  by  eastern  theology.  Judaism  requires  active  compas  sion,  confronting  evil  and  transform  ing  it  to  good.   “The  Jewish  way  in  the  face  of  evil,  according  to  Schwartz,  is  not  the  passive  resignation   espoused  by  eastern   theology.  Judaism  requires   active  compassion,  confronting  evil  and   transforming  it  to  good.”   Schwartz’s  greatest  concerns  are  environmental  —  over  population,  global  warming,  ozone  layer  deple  tion,  excessive  fossil  fuel  use,  pollu  tion,  hunger  and  malnutrition.   He  is  troubled  by  the  gaps  between  wealthy  and  poorer  nations.  His  solutions  are  based  on  the  Jewish  principle  of  bal  tashchit  —  the  prohibition  against  wantonly  destroying  and  wasting  the  things  of  God’s  world.  He  wants  humanity  to  live  in  more  modest  and  simple  ways  and  show  respect  for  God’s  crea   tures  and  creation.   Schwartz’s  mainstream  vegetari  anism  plays  an  important  role  in   this  book  and  one  has  the  feeling   that  the  evil  which  most  obsesses  him  is  the  cruelty  and  waste  involved  in  raising  animals  for  human  consumption.   Here  the  rabbinical  voice  that  he  most  persuasively  invokes  is  that  of  Rabbi  Abraham  Yitzhak  Ha-Cohen  Kook.  Schwartz  makes  a  strong  case  that  reducing  meat  consumption  is  good  for  the  environment.  But  his  argument  that  vegetarianism  would  raise  our  spiritual  level  is  more  prob  lematic.   This  book  is  filled  with  a  wide  range  of  telling  insights  and  observa  tions  and  does  not  steer  away  from  problems  and  contradictions  within  its  own  case.  For  instance,  he  raises  the  question  of  whether  On  what  he  calls  an  over  populated  world)  Jews  On  a  world  of  great  assimilation)  have  both  a  special  interest  and  obli  gation  to  try  to  increase  their  num  bers.  Here  he  suggests  the  possibility  that  Jews  might  be  given  that  privilege  on  the  grounds  that  they,  as  a  group,  have  contributed  disproportionately  to  the  overall  well  being  and  advancement  of  humanity.   This  is  not,  however,  the  answer  he  prefers.  Nor  does  he  believe  that  the  opposite  argument  for  zero  pop  ulation  growth  should  be  adopted  by  the  Jews.  His  recommendation  is  to  have  a  Jewish  community  that  aims  for  zero  population  impact  —  one  which  could  thus  increase  its  number  while  reducing  per-capita  consumption.   Schwartz  may  not  provide  fool  proof  answers,  but  Judaism  and  Global  Survival  is  recommended  for  those  interested  in  understanding  how  Jewish  values  can  guide  human  ity  toward  a  better  future.

"  Cabinet  shelves  bill  for   exclusively  Jewish  towns   Gil  Hoffman   JERUSALEM  —  Responding  to  a  pub  lic  outcry  over  a  measure  that  would  bar  Arabs  from  moving  into  Jewish  communities,  the  cabinet  this  week  voted  to  shelve  the  legislation.  Ministers  decided  by  a  vote  of  22-2  to  refer  the  issue  to  the  Public  Committee  for  Constitutional  Affairs  and  Basic  Laws  headed  by  former  finance  minister  Yaakov  Neeman,  which  is  weighing  the  government’s  policies  on  settlements,  an  official   said.

The  two  dissenting  votes  came  from  Druckman’s  NRP  colleagues,  Yitzhak  Levy  and  Effi  Eitam.  The  measure  was  proposed  as  a  way  of  bypassing  the  High  Court  of  Justice,  which  recently  overruled  the  exclu  sion  of  an  Arab  family  from  the  Galilee  community  of  Katzir.   Debate  on  the  issue  dates  back  several  years  to  when  an  Israeli  Arab  coilple,  Adel  and  Iman  Ka’adan,  sought  to  buy  a  home  in  Katzir  because  of  what  they  said  were  superior  services,  but  were  turned  down.  The  Ka’adans  subsequently  won  a  judgment  from  the  High  Court   saying  the  state  could  not  allocate  land  “on  the  basis  of  discrimination  between  Jews  and  non-Jews”,  lead  ing  to  the  proposed  legislation  to  bypass  the  ruling.   Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  told  the  cabinet  that  the  justices  erred  in  the  Katzir  ruling,  according  to  cabi  net  secretary  Gideon  Saar,  but  he  still  decided  that  the  issue  had  to  be  given  more  thought.   “Debate  on  the  issue  dates  back  several  years  to  when  an  Israeli  Arab  couple,  Adel   and  Iman  Ka’adan,  sought  to  buy  a  home  in  Katzir...  but   were  turned  down.""   “It  would  not  be  right  to  pursue  the  legislation  without  being  com  pletely  certain  about  the  necessity  for  such  a  law,”  Sharon  said.  “The  issue  is  significant  to  the  fabric  of  relations  between  Jews  and  Arabs,  and  among  Jews  themselves.”   Describing  last  week’s  decision,   Sa’ar  said  the  vote  in  favour  of  the  bill  had  not  been  final.  “We  exam  ined  the  legal  aspects  and  whether  we  have  alternatives  to  the  law  and  decided  to  take  a  different  course  of  action,”  Sa’ar  said.

"  Dozens  of  Jewish  graves  desecrated  in  Rome   Ruth  E  Gruber   ROME  —  Italian  police  and  Jewish  leaders  are  disagreeing  over  the  motives  behind  the  desecration  of  dozens  of  Jewish  graves  in  a  Rome  cemetery.   Police  over  the  weekend  appeared  to  be  focusing  their  investigation  on  local  cemetery  maintenance  rackets  rather  than  on  neo-Nazi  antisemites  or  Muslim  fanatics.   “I  don’t  think  I  agree  with  this,  but  they  seem  to  be  pursuing  that  line,”  said  Riccardo  Pacifici,  a  spokesman  for  Rome’s  Jewish  community.   He  urged  “prudence”,  however,  adding  that  if  rackets  were  involved,  it  was  hard  to  understand  why  only  Jewish  tombs  were  targeted.   Police  over  the  weekend  interrogated  cemetery  workers  and   seized  tools  and  maintenance  equipment.   Vandals  smashed  as  many  as  three  dozen  tombs  in  the  Jewish  section  of  Rome’s  Verano  cemetery  on  the  night  of  July  17,  the  beginning  of  Tisha  b’Av,  the  solemn  fast  day  that  marks  the  anniversary  of  the  destruction  of  the  First  and  Second  Temples.   “It  doesn’t  seem  to  me  as  if  this  attack  came  on  a  date  chosen  by  chance,”  said  Amos  Luzzatto,   president  of  the  Union  of  Italian  Jewish  Communities.  “The  coincidence  is  too  suggestive  to  be  ignored.”   Police  believe  at  least  10  people  took  part  in  the  raid.  They  shattered  marble  tablets,  destroyed  vases  and  statues,  wrenched  off  Stars  of  David  and  even  dug  down  into  graves.   But  unlike  previous  episodes  of  antisemitic  vandalism  in  Rome,  including  the  desecration  of  Jewish  graves  at  another  Rome  cemetery  in  1996,  the  perpetrators  did  not  scrawl  swastikas  or  antisemitic  slogans.   The  attack  stunned  local  Jews   and  prompted  an  outpouring  of  sympathy  and  indignation  from  President  Carlo  Azeglio  Ciampi,  Prime  Minister  Silvio  Berlusconi  and  other  officials.  Local  Muslim  groups  also  condemned  the  attack.   “This  is  extremely  serious,”  Rome  Mayor  Walter  Veltroni  said  July  18  after  visiting  the  scene.  “This  was  clearly  done  with  the  intention  of  damaging  a  place  that  is  particularly  dear  to  the  Jewish  community  of  Rome.”   Jewish  groups  and  other  observers  alike  viewed  the  desecra  tion  as  the  latest  in  the  wave  of  attacks  on  Jewish  institutions  and  individuals  in  several  countries  in  recent  months,  linked  to  the  conflict  in  the  Middle  East.  Most  of  those   Kalian  policemen  Inspect  the  Jewish  section  of  Rome's  Verano  cemetery  where  dozens  of  tombs  were  desecrated  last  week.  The  anttterrorism  branch  of  the  Kalian  police  are  Investigating  the  Incident.  Photo:  ap/aap   attacks  appear  to  have  been  carried  out  by  young  Arabs  hitting  out  at  Jews  as  surrogates  for  Israel.   To  date,  no  such  attacks  had  taken  place  in  Italy.  But  the  cemetery  raid  came  less  than  a  week  after  police  virtually  sealed  off  the  historic  Jewish  Ghetto  in  Venice  because  of  an  apparent  terrorist   threat.   In  a  message  last  Friday  to  Rome   Chief  Rabbi  Riccardo  Di  Segni,  Pope  John  Paul  n  said  he  was  “profoundly  saddened  by  this  detestable  act  that  follows  other  similar  events  of  a  serious  nature  that  have  taken  place  with  alarming  frequency  in  Europe  and  on  other  continents”.   He  also  condemned  such  “ignoble  acts  and  the  anti-Jewish  sentiments  that  inspire  them”.   The  national  director  of  the   Anti-Defamation  League,  Abraham  Foxman,  was  in  Rome  when  the  attack  took  place.  He  was  in  Italy  for  a  meeting  with  Berlusconi  as  part  of  consultations  with  European  leaders  on  how  to  combat  the  new  wave  of  antisemitism.  He,  too,  inspected  the  cemetery.  “The  Jews  of  the  world  feel  more  vulnerable  than  they  did  50,60  years  ago,”  he  said.   JTA   «  « ",2002-07-26

"  Zimbabwe’s  Jewish  farmers  go  to  court   Vie  AEmSsS?   ZIMBABWE’S  Jewish  farmers  have  joined  a  class-action  lawsuit  against  the  Zimbabwe  Gov  ernment  in  a  desperate  bid  to  avoid  being  thrown  off  their  properties  next  week.   The  government  has  ordered  the  country’s  2000  white  farmers  —  there  were  4000  until  a  year  ago,  the  others  having  been  forced  off—to  vacate  their  farms  by  August  10.   The  handful  of  Jewish  farmers  in  Zimbabwe  are  supporting  the  lawsuit  against  the  govern  ment’s  policy  of  forcible  land  acquisition,  seek  ing  to  exploit  loopholes  in  the  legislation.   “It’s  the  only  way  to  respond,”  said  Frank,  a  Jewish  farmer  who  has  been  on  the  land  for  25  years.   “Some  farmers  have  been  driven  off  by  force  —  by  police  and  army  personnel,  although  not  acting  on  orders.  Now  they’ve  given  us  this  deadline.  It’s  just  a  huge  land  grab.”   Speaking  to  the  Australian  Jewish  News  by  telephone,  Frank  (not  his  real  name)  admitted  to  being  resigned  to  the  court  challenge  being  thrown  out,  however.   “I  don’t  have  faith  in  the  court  system.  It’s  very  partisan.  But  I  do  have  faith  that  I  will  sur  vive.  On  the  other  hand,  I  might  lose  eveiything  and  walk  away  empty-handed.”   Frank  is  one  of  700  Jews  left  in  Zimbabwe  —  from  a  ceiling  of  8000  in  1980—with  75  per  cent  over  55,  and  a  steady  trickle  of  emigrants.   The  community  maintains  synagogues  in  Harare  and  Bulawayo,  a  Jewish  school  (where  six  per  cent  of  the  students  are  Jewish),  a  Jew  ish  old-age  home,  Board  of  Deputies,  Union  of   Jewish  Women  and  Chevra  Kadisha.   Zimbabwe-born  Frank  did  his  compulsory  military  service,  began  farming  livestock  and  crops,  and  suffered  the  tragedy  of  his  brother  being  shot  dead  several  years  ago.   “It’s  inshala  (God’s  will)  what  happens  now,”  he  said.  “We’ll  see  if  anarchy  and  lawlessness  prevail  over  law  and  order.  If  I  get  kicked  off  my  farm,  I  might  take  the  government  to  the  Inter   national  Criminal  Court  in  The  Hague.”   While  the  class-action  lawsuit  is  under  way,  farmers  are  negotiating  with  elements  of  the  government  over  whether  they  can  retain  part   of  their  land.   “Some  recognise  the  value  in  keeping  the  infrastructure  intact;  others  are  determined  to  rid  Africa  of  whites.  It  depends  on  whether  peo  ple  still  see  the  need  for  producers.”   Frank  is  considering  immigrating  to  Aus  tralia,  where  a  significant  number  of  Zimbab  weans  have  settled.  “Last  year  a  farmer  walked  away  from  10,000  acres  under  irrigation.  His  family  was  responsible  for  a  third  of  the  wheat  produced  in  Zimbabwe.  He  settled  in  Queens  land,  and  no-one  has  produced  anything  on  his   land  since  he  left.”   “The  best  defence  is  publicity—and  pepper-spray.  We're  helpless  here.""   Zimbabwe  is  in  the  grip  of  a  drought,  eco  nomic  collapse  and  starvation,  which  works  against  the  government,  Frank  said.  “If  they  seized  our  land  and  continued  producing,  I’d  be   nervous  because  there’d  be  a  rationale  to  their   program,  however  illogical.   “But  that’s  not  the  case.  You  need  skills  and   expertise  to  make  a  go  of  it,  so  hopefully  they’ll  see  the  sense  in  letting  us  stay.  But  you  have  to  hit  rock-bottom  before  you  bounce  up,  and  we  don’t  know  if  that’s  happened  yet.   “A  year  ago,  no-one  would  have  believed  it  could  have  got  so  bad  so  quickly,  so  what  hap  pens  now  is  beyond  prediction.  At  the  end  of  the  day,  it’s  still  my  home.  If  we  run  out  of  road,  we  run  out  of  road.  1  have  options,  but  I  also  have  a  preference  —  to  stay.”   Despite  the  fraught  situation,  Frank  does  not  sleep  with  a  gun  under  his  bed.  “The  best  defence  is  publicity  —  and  pepper-spray.  You  can’t  use  a  weapon  because  you’d  suffer  reper  cussions.  You  can’t  defend  yourself  without  it  bouncing  back  on  you.  We’re  helpless  here.” ",2002-08-02
"  What’s  wrong  with  Jewish  weddings   THERE’S  nothing  quite  like  a   Jewish  wedding  —  the  emo  tion,  the  speeches,  the  danc  ing.  But  there  can  be  problems   too...   •  Tandoori  chicken.  Never  seen  it.  Now  I’m  not  all  that  fussy  —  I’d  settle  for  Tandoori  salmon,  but  I’ve  never  seen  that  either.  Just  the  smoked  variety.  The  more  Jews,  the  bigger  the  simcha,  the  more  the  smoked  salmon,  and  I’m  beginning  to  whinge.   Wouldn’t  mind  some  curry  sauce  occasionally,  but  I’ve  never   even  smelt  a  Thai  dish  at  a  wed   ding.  Unhappy?  You  bet.  Especial  ly  given  the  proliferation  of  exotic   bitter  multi-coloured  lettuce  leaves  on  your  standard  wedding  platter.  How  did  that  start?  Proba  bly  going  cheap  at  the  market,  I  suppose.  Probably  in  the  cherry  bin  (sorry,  bad  pun).   •  Too  many  strangers.  I  knew  a  few  people  at  my  bar  mitzvah,  but  this  wedding  thing  is  getting  out  of  control.  Half  of  the  guests  by  defi  nition  are  unknown  to  either  the  bride  or  groom.   I  would  like  everyone  to  wear  name-tags  with  a  little  comment  to  facilitate  conversation:  “Bella  Abrahamowitz,  bride’s  grand  mother’s  friend”;  “Magda  Sabo,  I  made  the  strudel”;  “Anthony  Joshua,  brother,  I  know  I’m  older  but  I’m  taking  my  time”.   •  No  smoke.  Nothing  irritates  me  more  than  the  absence  of  smoke  at  your  standard  celebra  tion.  Most  life-changing  events  are  associated  with  smoke;  lighting  the  candles  on  your  first  birthday  cake,  your  first  scout  camp  away  from  your  parents,  your  first  ciga  rette.  But  the  wedding  event  is  generally  smoke-free.  No  wedding  cake  candles,  no  bonfires  and  no  fireworks,  hence  no  smoke.   What  we  need  are  a  few  strate  gically  placed  smoke  machines.  Imagine  a  dollop  of  smoke  obscur  ing  the  awkward  steps  of  the  bride  and  groom  as  they  strive  to  over  come  the  Semitic  inability  to  dance  gracefully  (that’s  what  the  hora  is  about  —  lean  on  each  other,  run  around  in  a  circle  and  pretend  it’s  footwork).   The  wisps  of  carbon  dioxide  swirling  up  around  the  hastily  learnt  bridal  waltz  that  rapidly   VIEWPOINT   Anthony  Joshua   becomes  a  slow  shuffle.  It  would  look  intentional  as  well.  What  a   stroke  of  genius.   •  Like  opening  the  presents  afterwards,  Jewish  weddings  start  enthusiastically  but  end  too  quick  ly.  Once  they  carry  her  out  on  the  chair  it’s  “Good  night,  where’s  my  jacket?”.  Start  cleaning  up.  Now  what  sort  of  a  way  to  end  a  func  tion  is  that?  Can  you  think  of  any  other  social  occasion  when  the  hosts  get  carried  outside,  the  guests  take  the  floral  decorations,  then  everyone  goes  home?   “Can  you  think  of  any  other  occasion  when  the  hosts   get  carried  outside,  the  guests  take  the  floral   decorations,  then  everyone   goes  home?”   I  tried  it  at  the  Silverbergsteins  after  a  particularly  noxious  chick  en  soup  —  take  my  advice,  it’s  not  worth  it.  A  proper  way  to  end  a  good  night  is  a  bit  of  a  dance  in  a  club,  then  off  to  DeeBees  for  a  cof  fee.  I’m  sure  they  wouldn’t  mind  the  business,  and  I’m  sure  Renee  could  do  us  all  a  deal  on  that  night  club  when  the  police  let  him  reopen  it.  At  least  the  next  morn  ing,  everyone,  not  just  the  young  couple,  could  wake  up  and  need  a  holiday.   •  Another  thing  —  d’you  think  that  whilst  the  bride  and  groom  are  enjoying  each  other,  they  would  give  the  guests  a  parting  thought?  It’s  the  least  they  can  do  after  filling  us  up  with  the  inevitable  variety  of  kosher  gelato.  Takeaway  lolly  bags  have  been  out  of  fashion  since  my  seventh  birth  day;  how  I  rue  the  day.  Doesn’t  even  have  to  be  sweets;  I’d  settle  for  the  leftover  Tandoori  chicken.   D  Dr  Anthony  Joshua  is  a  twen  tysomething  who  has  seen  too  many  of  his  friends  get  married. ",2002-03-01
"  Heather  Lee,  Kim  Cunlo.   Jewish  melodies  will   sound  from  die  depths   Aviva   CHANTS  and  harmonies  by  Jewish  performers  will  echo  from  the  depths  of  the  Jenolan  Caves  this   month.   Songs  of  die  Wind  will  be  the  final  performance  of  a  series  of  concerts  called  Songlines,  part  of  the  Blue  Mountains  World  Heritage  Aits  and  Environment  Festival.   Sydney  couple  Heather  Lee  and  composer  and  musicologist  Kim  Cunio  have  been  invited  for  the  fourth  year  to  perform  Hebrew  chants  and  Mediaeval  music  in  the   caves.   They  have  toured  Australia  and  internationally,  performing  early  sacred  music  at  festivals  and  exhi  bitions.  This  recently  included  com  posing  the  accompanying  music  to  the  Sydney  2000  Dead  Sea  Scrolls   Exhibition.   The  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  commissioned  the  couple  the  same   year  to  score  a  Music  of  Shanghai  CD  for  its  Jews  of  Shanghai  exhibi   tion.   Opera  singer  Ms  Lee  describes  herself  as  not  religious,  but  “on  meeting  Kim,  the  Jewish  roots  returned.  Ever  since,  I’ve  been  per  forming  Jewish  chants  and  spiritual  songs”  —  in  10  languages.   Describing  them  as  a  “vibrant  couple,”  concert  producer  Natalie  Newton  repeatedly  invites  Ms  Lee  and  Mr  Cunio  to  perform  because  “they  communicate  so  well  with  the  caves,  in  harmony  with  the  envi  ronment  and  its  sacredness”.   “It’s  the  best  concert  to  be  part  of  because  of  the  spirituality  in  the  caves,”  Mr  Cunio  said.  “We  try  to  give  people  a  mystical  experience,  not  a  concert  where  we  simply  per  form.  It’s  different  to  modem  music  because  it  transforms  you  and  takes  you  to  another  place,  particu  larly  Eastern  and  Sephardi  Jewish   music.”   Upcoming  activities  involve  performing  in  India  at  the  international  Peace  of  Mind  conference,  and  an  Australia  Council  Grant  will  enable  them  to  research  Jewish  music  and  chants  from  Baghdad.   Fellow-musician   Stephen  Rosenberg  will  participate  in  the  Songlines  concert  for  the  first  time.   Playing  a  number  of  instruments  including  a  Japanese  flute  called  a  shakuhachi,  and  a  didjeri  doo,  he  will  be  the  first  in  a  series  of  performers  begin  ning  in  the  Cathedral  Cave.   With  a  family  presence  in  Australia  since  the  1800s,  he  does  not  avidly  practise  the  religion  but  is  proud  of  his  history  and  keeps  up  to  date  with   events  in  Israel.   The  Songs  of  the  Wind  concert  will  take  place  at  the  Jenolan  Caves  on  September  22  from  4  6.30pm.  The  cost  is  $120,  including  champagne.   Bookings  are  essential.

"  How  to  spot  a   ONCE  WERE  WORRIERS   I  THINK  I’m  turning  into  my  father.   It  started  with  the  foot-jiggling  thing:  every  time  my  dad  sits  down  anywhere,  he  starts  jiggling  his  feet  around  like  he  needs  to  go  to  the  toilet,  and  lately  I’ve  started  jiggling  my  feet  around  too  —  and  I’ve  also  started  doing  his  “Going  to  the  toilet  a  lot”  thing  as  well.  Then  there’s  the  ear-hair;  my  dad  has  tremendous  hair  growing  out  of  his  ears  —  in  summer,  birds  actually  get  caught  in  there.   For  years  I  made  fun  of  his  ear  hair,  I  mocked  his  ear-hair,  I  TEASED  HIS  EAR-HAIR  —  but  now  I’ve  got  ear-hair  of  my  own,  and  suddenly  I  think  it  looks  kind  of  distinguished,  and  glamorous,  and  even  a  bit  sexy,  particularly  if  you  plait  it  in  little  reg  gae  knots.   But  there’s  one  thing  that  dad  has  always  done  that  I  never  thought  I’d  do  myself,  and  that’s  his  “Jewish-celebrity-spotting”  —  also  known  as  “Hey,  Danny,  did  you  know  that  Elvis  is  actually  Jewish""  syndrome.  My  father  is  obsessed  with  every  celebrity  on  the  planet  who  happens  to  be  Jewish,  and  he  can’t  help  himself,  he  just  has  to  tell  you  about  them:  You’ll  be  watching  an  old  Danny  Kaye  movie  on  TV  and   he’ll  blurt  out  “Danny  Kaye,  real  name  David  Daniel  Kaminsky,  Jewish.”  You’ll  be  listening  to  the  latest  CD  from  Beck,  and  he’ll  say  “Beck,  alternative  indie-rock  musi  cian  with  a  folk-funk  fusion,  Jewish”.  You’ll  be  reading  a  newspaper  and  he’ll  lean  over  and  say,  “Ariel  Sharon,  Prime  Minister  of  Israel,  Jewish”  and  you’ll  say  “Well  of  course  he’s  Jewish,  everyone  knows  that”  and  he’ll  say  “Oh  right,  well  how  about  Rabbi  Gutnick?”   I  keep  saying  to  dad  “Who  cares?  What  does  it  matter?  I’m  not  inter  ested  in  whether  Elvis  is  Jewish,  or  Madeleine  Albright  is  Jewish,  or  Mickey  Mouse  is  Jewish”  and  Dad  says  “Don’t  be  an  idiot,  Mickey  Mouse  isn’t  Jewish  —  but  Donald  Duck,  yes,  great-grandmother  on  his  maternal  side”.  So  I’ve  had  to  live  through  years  and  years  of  this  unbearable  Jewish  celebrity  spot  ting,  and  then  just  recently  a  scary  thing  happened:  I  was  watching  the   TV  news  with  my  beloved  and  there  was  a  story  about  Winona  Ryder  in  court,  and  I  couldn’t  help  myself,  I  just  blurted  out,  “Hey,  did  you  know  that  Winona  the  shoplifter  is  Jewish   —  her  real  name  is  Winona   HOROWITZ  the  shoplifter”.  I  have  no  idea  how  I  knew  this,  but  I  did:  I  was  channelling  some  kind  of  strange  powerful  Jew-spotting  force,  and  from  that  moment  on,  I  WAS  HOOKED.   I  was  running  around,  telling  everyone  that  Sean  Penn  is  Jewish,  and  Natalie  Portman  is  Jewish,  and  Lenny  Kravitz,  and  Alicia  Silverstone,  and  Lou  Reed,  and  Michelle  Pfeiffer  —  well,  actually,  she’s  not,  but  we’ll  take  her.  And  AJi  G,  and  Jerry  Seinfeld,  and  every  actor  in  an  American  sitcom  from  1991  to  1999,  and  David  Beckham,  and  Christopher  Columbus,  and  Superman,  and  Jesus  Christ,  and   Prime  Minister  John  Howard.   Of  course  he  must  be  Jewish.  Just  check  that  ear-hair.   U  Danny  Katz  is  the  author  of  Dork  Geek  Jew.  His  column  appears  monthly  in  the  Australian  Jewish   News.

"  Jewish   Renewal  comes   to  Sydney   AROUND  THE   SHULES   Danya  Levy   FOR  the  first  time,  Sydney  Jews  will  this  week  have  the  opportunity  to  experience  Jewish  Renewal  —  a  worldwide  mystical  movement  taught  and  practised  in  the  United  States  for  the  past  20  years.   American  Cantor  Robert  Esformes  is  in   Sydney  this  weekend  and  Melbourne  next  week  to  teach  and  lead  Shabbat  services.   Jewish  Renewal  seeks  to  enhance  Jewish  spirituality  through  meditation,  chanting,  music  and  traditional  Kabbalistic  and  Chassidic  sources.   It  is  a  trans-denominational  movement  which  aims  to  “renew”  the  kavanah  —  spiritual  direction  —  with  which  Jews  practise  their  religion.   Jewish  Renewal  is  a  new  way  to  look  at  Judaism,  said  Dr  Edna  Ross,  who  is  organ  ising  Cantor  Esformes’  Australian  tour.   “Many  Jews  feel  a  deep  sense  of  identi  fying,  but  have  not  been  able  to  find  mean  ing  in  Jewish  services  or  practices.   “Many  have  turned  to  other  sources,  such  as  Eastern  religions,  to  put  meaning   into  their  lives.   But  the  longing  to  feel  a  connection  with  the  great  unknown  and  to  experience  the  meaning  of  life  can  be  met  within  the  Jewish  tradition.”   There  is  a  worldwide  revival  of  Jewish   traditional  wisdom,  meditation,  chanting  and  the  study  of  mystical  texts,  she  said.  “These  are  vehicles  for  personal  and  com  munal  spiritual  growth  through  which  deeper  levels  of  Judaism  can  be  explored.”   Cantor  Esformes  trained  at  the  Academy  for  Jewish  Religion  and  Yeshiva  University  in  New  York.  He  received  can  torial  ordination  from  the  Aleph  Alliance  for  Jewish  Renewal  and  serves  Conservative  and  Reform  synagogues  in  the  US  and  Canada.   He  has  been  said  to  “raise  the  souls  and  hearts  of  those  who  worship  with  him”,  Dr  Ross  said.   Cantor  Robert  Esformes   Jewish  Renewal  services  follow  the  same  structure  as  traditional  Jewish  serv  ices,  Temple  Emanuel  music  and  Bikkur  Cholim  director  Cantor  Joseph  Toltz  said.  “It  incorporates  the  same  principal  ele  ments,  but  with  less  text  and  more  music,  less  performance  and  more  participation.   “Just  come  with  an  open  mind  and  heart  and  be  prepared  for  a  new,  moving  and  challenging  experience.”   Cantor  Esformes  will  be  at  Temple  Emanuel  Woollahra  to  lead  an  Erev  Shabbat  musical  service  on  April  19  at  6.30pm  and  on  Saturday,  April  20  at  10am  to  take  a  Renewal  Shabbat  service.   A  one-day  meditation  workshop,  which  will  include  an  exploration  of  meditation  techniques,  chanting  and  an  introduction  to  Kabbalah,  will  be  held  on  April  21.   The  workshop  costs  $90,  including  lunch.  To  book,  call  Dr  Ross  on  9810  1018  or  Sue  Fisher  on  9365  3879.   Cantor  Esformes  will  also  run  an  infor  mal  musical  workshop  on  April  22  to  teach  Sephardi  melodies  set  to  familiar  texts  in  the  Shabbat  service. ",2002-04-19
"  Lack  of  Jewish  support  for  interfaith  body  deplored   LACK  of  support  from  the  Jewish  communi  ty  for  the  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  has  been  deplored  by  the  president  of  the  interfaith  organisation.   While  “we  have  extremely  staunch  repre  sentation  from  some  sections  of  the  Jewish  community,  it  is  not  in  proportion  to  that  which  comes  from  the  Christian  side  of  the  table”,  Salvation  Army  Major  Graham  Harris  told  the  Council’s  annual  general  meeting.   “The  Council’s  charter  to  educate  Christians  and  Jews  to  appreciate  each  oth  ers’  distinctive  beliefs  specifically  directs  us  to  achieve  this  through  awareness  of  their  common  ground  and  to  respect  their  indi  viduality,”  Major  Harris  continued.   “We  can  only  accomplish  this  by  encour  aging  dialogue  between  the  faiths  to  engen  der  understanding  and  eradicate  much  of  the  mis-teaching  of  history  in  past  eras.”   A  member  of  the  Salvation  Army’s  educa  tional  arm,  Major  Harris  said  the  Council  needs  greater  recognition  from  members  of  the  Jewish  community  of  the  importance  of  its  objective  of  stamping  out  antisemitism.   “I  appeal  to  our  Jewish  friends  to  recog  nise  this  imperative  and  the  significance  of  dialogue.   “1  appeal  to  them  to  open  their  hearts  and  recognise  that  their  Christian  neighbours  are  no  longer  their  Christian  enemies  and  to  join  them  to  benefit  from  their  commonalities,  as  indeed  we  benefit  from  our  individualities.”   Major  Harris  voiced  appreciation  to  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  for  distribut  ing  the  Council’s  newsletter  to  members.   Any  member  of  the  Jewish  community   NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  president  Major  Graham  Harris.   who  would  like  to  receive  the  publication  free  of  charge  should  contact  Council  secre  tary  Sister  Marianne  Dacy  at  9351  4162  or  email  mdacy@library.usyd.edu.au,  he  added.   “The  next  step  will  be  for  members  of  the  Board  who  agree  with  the  aims  and  charter  of  the  Council  to  act  as  multipliers  —  to  make  the  members  of  the  organisations  they  represent  aware  of  the  Council  and  to  encourage  them  to  participate  in  its  activi   ties  and  its  debates.   “Their  participation  at  our  functions  or  as  nominees  for  the  Council’s  executive  will  be  warmly  welcome.” ",2002-09-13
"  News   Dispute  over  Jewish  co-operation  with  Hilaly   Alana  Rosenbaum   JEWISH  leaders  have  come  under  fire  for  cooperating  with  Australia’s  Mufti,  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hilaly,  who  has  a  notorious  history  of  inciting  hatred  of  Jews.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman  and  Great  Synagogue  Senior  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  last  week  authorised  a  joint  Jewish  and  Islamic  statement  calling  for  peaceful  dialogue  in  the  Middle  East   and  an  end  to  hostilities  between  Muslims  and  Jews  in  Australia.   The  statement  had  two  other   signatories  —  Sheikh  Hilaly  and   Lebanese  Muslim  Association  vice  president  Keysar  Trad.   Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  national  chairman  Mark  Leibler  is  appalled  by  the  statement,  which  he  described  as  “counter  to  Israel’s  best  interests”.   “The  statement  is  outrageous  and  exhibited  gross  lack  of  judgment,”   Mr  Leibler  said.   The  NSW  Rabbinical  Council,  of  which  Rabbi  Apple  is  registrar,  has   described  the  statement  as   “inappropriate”.   Last  year,  Sheikh  Hilaly  was   Stephen  Rothman   filmed  praising  suicide  bombers.   An  Egyptian  who  arrived  in  Australia  in  1982,  he  has  a  history  of  preaching  against  Israel.  In  1988  there  was  pressure  to  deport  him  after  he  gave  a  lecture  describing  Jews  as  “the  cause  of  all  wars  threatening  the  peace  and  security  of  the  whole  inhabited  earth”.   Sheikh  Hilaly  has  never  retracted  the  comments,  but  the  statement  he  signed  last  week  condemned  local  violence  that  has  followed  the  escalation  of  the  intifada.   “Islamic  and  Jewish  leaders  of  NSW  call  upon  all  members  of  their  communities  and  all  other  Aust  ralians  not  to  allow  their  personal  feelings  about  events  in  the  Middle   East  to  find  expression  in  violent  behaviour,”  the  statement  said.   It  also  called  for  the  cessation  of  “all  acts  of  violence  and  military  actions  and  to  use  rational  peaceful  dialogue  to  achieve  a  just  peace  that  will  bring  safety  and  security  to  all  the  people  of  the  region”.   Mr  Leibler  accused  the  signatories  of  undermining  communal  efforts  to  marginalise  Sheikh  Hilaly.  He  also  objected  to  the  wording  of  the  statement,  which  he  said  suggested  “moral  equivalence”  between  Palestinian   terrorism  and  self-defensive   military  action  on  the  part  of  Israel.   “We  felt  it  important  to  bind  him  to  a  statement  that  there   ought  not  to  be  violence  against  the  community.”   “To  call  on  world  leaders  and  stress  on  responsible  people  the  necessity  of  stopping  all  acts  of  violence  and  military  action,  I  regard  as  counter  to  Israel’s  best  interests  and  nothing  short  of  appalling  in  the  current  climate.”   Mark  Lelbler   Mr  Rothman  disputes  Mr  Leibler’s  interpretation  of  the  statement  and  stands  by  his  decision  to  sign  it.   “Sydney  has  suffered  a  number  of  problems  associated  with  our  relationship  with  the  Arab  community.  One  of  those  is  that  there  has  not,  certainly  in  the  recent  past,  been  a  call  by  any  leaders  in  the  Arab  community  for  non-viol-ence  against  the  Jewish  community.   “Given  the  position  that  has  been  previously  taken  by  Sheikh  Hilaly,  we  felt  it  important  to  bind  him  to  a  statement  that  there  ought  not  to  be  violence  against  the  Jewish  community,”  Mr  Rothman  said.   Rabbi  Apple  also  stands  by  the  statement,  but  said  that  when  he  put  his  name  to  it,  he  did  not  know  Sheikh  Hilaly  would  be  a  signatory.   The  executive  of  the  Board  of  Deputies  endorsed  the  statement  at  a  meeting  this  week.   The  NSW  Rabbinical  Council  has  distanced  itself  from  the  statement,  and  also  condemned  Jewish  involvement  in  the  Palm  Sunday  rally  in  Sydney.  Its  criticism  follows  reports  that  Organisation  of  Rabbis  of  Australasia  president  Rabbi  Selwyn  Franklin  carried  a  banner  at  the  rally  with  Sheikh  Hilaly.   “Such  statements  and  participation  in  rallies  that  are  extensions  of  those  used  to  vilify  Israel  are  inappropriate  at  present,  and  suggest  that  Arab  terrorism  and  Jewish  self-defence  are  morally  equivalent  —  which,  clearly,  they  are  not,”  the  NSW  Rabbinical  Council  statement  said.   Neither  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  nor  Zionist  Federation  of  Australia  president  Ron  Weiser   would  comment  on  the  matter.

"  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  —  making  friends  where  it  matters   THE  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  is  tak  ing  proactive  steps  to  expand  its  reach  into  the  next  generation  by  establishing  a  Young  Friends  of  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  organisation.   The  group  comprises  motivated  young  professionals  and  university  students  from  a  variety  of  back  grounds,  who  endorse  the  museum,  its  activities  and  objectives.   Young  Friends  founder  Amelia  (Pixie)  Klein  came  up  with  the  idea  after  an  internship  at  the  Museum  of  Jewish  Heritage  in  New  York  in  2000.   “The  museum  had  a  Young  Friends  group  with  their  own  pro  gram,  and  1  realised  that  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  needs  a  group  representing  young  adults  to  encourage  their  interest  and  involvement,”  she  said.   Through  a  program  of  cultural  and  artistic  events,  the  Young  Friends  will  seek  to  encourage  inter  community  interaction  and  understanding.   Miriam  Feller,  Anna  Groden.   “It  is  paramount  that  the  group  represents  a  cross-section  of  communities  and  cultures,  includ  ing  third-generation  descendants  of  Holocaust  survivors,  Jewish  non  descendants  and  the  general  public  who  are  interested  in  Jewish  histo  ry  and  culture,”  Ms  Klein  said.   Young  Friends  activities  will  include  events  designed  to  build  bridges  with  other  ethnic  communi  ties  and  cultural  institutions,  and  to  provide  a  forum  for  discussing  the  Holocaust  and  Jewish  culture  and  history.   The  steering  committee  includes   Jewish  and  non-Jewish  young  adults  from  different  sectors  of  pro  fessional  expertise:  Miriam  Feiler  (project  manager,  International  Trade  Services),  Anna  Groden  (art  curator  and  historian),  Amelia  Klein  (honours  graduate,  Jewish  and  Holocaust  History),  Gila  Levitan  (past  president,  Zionist  Youth  Organisation)  and  Nathan  Sandon  (History  teacher,  Barker  College).   “Our  group  would  like  to  estab  lish  a  close  relationship  and  dia  logue  with  the  Holocaust  survivors  who  guide  at  the  museum,”  Ms  Groden  said.  “Establishing  this  gen  erational  link  is  a  central  motiva  tion.”   To  this  end,  the  Young  Friends  held  a  meeting  with  three  of  the  survivor-guides  —  museum  vice  president  Marika  Weinberger,  John   Weiner  and  Alex  Ferson.   “The  meeting  reinforced  the  importance  of  what  the  Young  Friends  seek  to  achieve  in  ensuring   Nathan  Sandon,  Gila  Levitan.   the  continuity  of  the  legacy  oi  the  Holocaust,”  Ms  Groden  said.   The  Young  Friends  of  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  will  be  launched  at  a  cocktail  reception  at  the  museum   on  October  3.   Future  events  will  include  educa  tional  programs  and  exhibition  tours,  social  gatherings,  film  forums  and  panel  discussions  on  issues  of   social  ana  cultural  relevance.   The  committee  hopes  that  Jews  and  non-Jews  alike  will  join  the  Young  Friends  in  “guaranteeing  the  survival  of  the  museum  by  increas  ing  awareness  among  young  Australians  of  its  importance  as  a  historical  icon  and  vibrant  part  of  Sydney’s  cultural  landscape”,  Ms   Klein  said.

In  a  show  of  solidarity  with  Israel,  Australian  Jewry  rallies  across  the  country.  The  biggest  pro-Israel  rally  is  in  Sydney,  where  10,000  people  converge  near  the  Israeli  Consulate,  making  up  the  largest  gathering  of  NSW  Jewry  on  record.  Similar  rallies  are  held  in  Melbourne,  Brisbane  and  Perth.   May  2002   JEWISH  leaders  condemn  a  petition  to  boycott  scientific,  cultural  and  research  links  between  Australia  and  Israel.  Behind  the  petition  is  a  pair  of  scholars  from  Canberra’s  Australian  National  University  —  John  Docker,  who  is  Jewish,  and  Ghassan  Hage,  a  Lebanese  Christian.  In  response,  Jewish  academics  launch  a  counter-petition.   THE  2001  Census  results  reveal  83,993  Australian  Jews  —  a  rise  of  4.99  per  cent  over  the  last  five  years.  Most  notable  is  the  leap  in  the  Perth  Jewish  community  —  7.9  per  cent  since  1996.  Because  the  religious  question  is  optional,  there  are  believed  to  be  more  than  100,000  Jews  in  Australia.   After  11  years  of  planning,  the  Sydney  eruv  is  finally  operational.

JuEy  2002   THE  Israeli  Government  announces  it  will  close  eight  diplomatic  missions,  including  its  consulate  in  Sydney  and  its  embassy  in  the  New  Zealand  capi  tal  of  Wellington.

"  Opinion   The  power  of  a   united  Jewish  voice   THIS  week’s  pro-Israel  solidarity  rallies  in  Sydney  and  Melbourne   may  not  have  been  on  the  scale  of  last  week’s  rally  in  Washing  ton,  where  an  estimated  100,000  people  demonstrated  on  Capi   tol  Hill.   Nevertheless,  the  Australian  rallies  delivered  four  powerful  mes  sages  —  to  the  Australian  public,  the  media,  the  Federal  Government  and  the  people  of  Israel.   All  four  messages,  individually  and  collectively,  were  critical  at  this   time.   First,  the  images  that  were  beamed  around  the  country  this  week  depicted  civil,  law-abiding  Australian  Jews  in  a  massive  show  of  soli  darity  with  Israel.  They  called  for  peace,  not  war;  a  return  to  dialogue,   not  to  the  battlefield.   Whereas  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  rightly  condemned  the  vio  lent  outbreaks  which  occurred  at  a  recent  pro-Palestinian  rally  in  Syd  ney,  the  pro-Israel  rallies  in  both  Sydney  and  Melbourne  were  marked  by  dignified  appeals  for  peace  and  for  balanced  coverage  in  the  media;  by  urgent  pleas  for  greater  understanding;  by  moving  renditions  of  Hebrew  songs;  and  by  orderly  conduct.   What  was  significant  was  not  merely  the  size  of  the  rallies  —  although,  at  an  estimated  10,000  people,  the  Sydney  rally  is  believed  to  have  been  the  largest  ever  held  by  Sydney  Jewry  —  but  that  the  gath  erings  were  held  in  peace.  No  flag-burning,  no  incitement  to  hatred,  no  violence,  no  racial  vilification.  Instead,  a  dignified,  peaceful  display  of  solidarity.   Second,  sections  of  the  Australian  media,  many  of  which  have  exhibited  appalling  lack  of  context  at  best  and  blatant  bias  at  worst,  were  offered  a  perspective  which  considered  the  Israeli  position.   Speaker  after  speaker  reminded  the  audience  —  and  the  media  —  that  Israel  waged  this  war  in  response  to  an  unprecedented  campaign   of  indiscriminate  murder  of  its  citizens  —  over  400  in  recent  weeks.   Both  in  Sydney  and  Mel  bourne,  they  provided  much  needed  context  often  overlooked  by  the  media:  that  it  is  the  Pales  tinian  leaders  who  have  failed  their  people,  repeatedly  missing  opportunities  to  embark  on  the  road  to  independence;  that  there  is  no  moral  equivalence  between  Palestinian  suicide  bombers  and  Israeli  self-defence;  that  Israel  offered  the  Palestinians  a  state  in   July  2000,  but  instead  they  chose  war;  that  while  America  wages  a  war  on  terror  with  minimal  criti   cism  or  scrutiny  from  either  the  media  or  the  United  Nations,  Israel  is  pilloried  for  adopting  a  similar  strategy.   Unfortunately,  both  rallies  were  poorly  covered  by  the  media,  although  the  Sydney  rally  received  decent  television  exposure  on  most  major  networks.  The  Australian,  however,  chose  to  ignore  the  event  entirely  and  many  other  dailes  gave  it  minimal  coverage  despite  the  fact  that  it  was  arguably  the  largest  rally  ever  in  the  history  of  the  Syd  ney  Jewish  community.   It  would  appear  that  10,000  Jews  demonstrating  at  a  peaceful  rally  —  almost  25  per  cent  of  the  community  —  does  not  warrant  as  much  coverage  as  a  few  thousand  Palestinians  at  a  rally.   Third,  the  vast  sea  of  people  waving  blue-and-white  flags  in  Sydney  and  Melbourne  may  not  have  swayed  many  opinions  in  Canberra’s  corridors  of  power,  but  they  may  have  helped  reaffirm  opinions  of  those  on  both  sides  of  the  political  divide.   The  Federal  Government  has  been  supportive  of  Israel’s  right  to  self-defence  in  its  war  on  terror,  and  it  was  important  for  Australian  Jewry  to  remind  the  government  of  the  overwhelming  support  within  the  Jewish  community  for  Israel,  and  of  the  community’s  acknowl  edgement  of  that  support.   Finally,  the  demonstrations  were  a  vocal  message  to  the  people  of   Israel  that  they  are  not  alone  —  that  Jews  around  the  globe  are   united  with  them.   It  is  crucial  in  these  troubled  times  for  Israelis  to  see  tangible  demonstrations  of  support.  Across  the  world  —  in  Washington,  New  York,  Montreal,  Toronto,  Paris,  Berlin,  Rome  —  as  well  as  Sydney  and  Melbourne,  Jews  are  rallying  for  an  end  to  terrorism,  for  a  return  to  dia  logue,  for  a  sober  approach  to  the  impasse,  free  of  prejudice  and   hatred.   The  massive  turnout  at  these  demonstrations  is  largely  a  function  of  the  fact  that  Australian  Jews  feel  an  unshakeable  solidarity  for  Israel.  But  it  is  also  indicative  of  the  fact  that  our  own  Jewish  identity  is  being  called  into  question  as  the  Middle  East  conflict  spills  into  the  streets  of  the  Diaspora.   Above  all,  this  week’s  rallies  illustrated  to  the  Australian  public,  the  media,  the  government  and  the  people  of  Israel  that  Australian  Jewry  is  united  in  its  support  for  Israel,  and  that  it  urges  widespread  support  for  what  is  still  the  only  democracy  in  the  Middle  East  —  a  nation  which  seeks  not  to  destroy  its  neighbours,  but  to  live  in  peace  with   them.   “The  massive  turnout  at  these  demonstrations  is  indicative  of  the  fact  that  our  own  Jewish  identity  is  being  called  into  question  as  the  Middle  East  conflict   spills  into  the  streets   of  the  Diaspora.” ",2002-04-26
"  Israeli  forces  on  the  move.   Photo:  AAP/AP   Jewish,  Islamic  leaders  in  joint  call  for  peace   LEADERS  of  the  Jewish  and  Islamic  communities  of  NSW  have  issued  an  unprecedented  call  for  negotiation  to  solve  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict,  and  for  their  communities  “not  to  allow  feelings  to  find  expression  in  violent  behaviour”.

"  Jewish  leader  forced   out  of  President’s  office   Magnus  Bennett   PRAGUE  —  As  far  as  the  leader  of  Prague’s  Jewish  community  is  concerned,  the  spirit  of  native  son  Franz  Kafka  is  alive  and  well  in  the  Czech  capital.   Forced  out  as  a  senior  aide  to  President  Vaclav  Havel  because  his  role  as  a  Jewish  leader  allegedly  clashed  with  his  state  post,  Tomas  Jelinek  invoked  the  sort  of  anonymously  sinister  plots  that  have  become  synonymous  with  Kafka's  fiction.   Jelinek,  who  worked  as  an  economist  in  the  political  department  of  Havel’s  presidential  office,  was  told  that  his  election  as  chairman  of  the  Jewish  community  last  April  breached  Czech  labour  codes  because  the  community  acts  like  a  business  in  conducting  financial  transactions.   Jelinek  said  he  reluctantly  agreed  to  terminate  his  contract  at  the  end  of  October  to  spare  Havel  potential  embarrassment.  Since  then,  he  has  been  given  a  short-term,  non-staff  contract  to  clear  his  desk  of  current  projects.   Jelinek,  who  now  has  taken  on  the  role  of  Prague  Jewish  community  chairman  on  a  full-time  basis,  said  he  was  extremely  disappointed  at  the  way  Havel’s  office  handled  his   case.   “They  were  clearly  unhappy  that  I   became  chairman  of  the  Prague  Jewish  community,  and  they  found  some  reason  that  it  was  inappropriate  for  me  to  carry  out  both  functions,”  he  said.   “It  is  like  something  from  a  Franz  Kafka  novel,  in  which  a  person  doesn’t  know  what  he  is  accused  of  until  he  is  found  guilty.  They  told  me  nothing  behind  the  reasons,  other  than  the  fact  that  it  was   against  the  labour  code.”   The  presidential  office’s  chief  of  staff,  Ivo  Mathe,  said  the  office  had  consulted  a  number  of  lawyers  in  an  attempt  to  keep  Jelinek  in  his  post.   “I  tried  for  seven  months  to  find   one  legal  opinion  that  supported  Mr  Jelinek’s  position,  but  unfortunately  they  all  said  the  same,  that  he  must  leave  because  he  is  chairman  of  a  business,”  Mathe  said.   Jelinek  said  his  legal  advisers  had  said  the  Prague  Jewish  community  is  a  non-profit  organisation,  and  therefore  not  a  business  in  terms  of  the  labour  code.   He  said  he  had  been  left  with  two  options  —  to  leave  his  post  or  sue  the  state.  “I  decided  to  leave  because  I  did  not  want  to  harm  the  President’s  image  by  going  to  court.  President  Havel  has  always  shown  great  respect  for  Jews  in  the  Czech  Republic,  and  he  was  extremely  supportive  in  the  struggle  for  restitution  for  the  Jewish   communities  here  in  the  1990s.’   JTA ",2002-01-04
"  Security  stops  Jewish  plea  for  help  for  Zimbabwe   Bernard  Freedman   EXTRAORDINARY  security  at  the  Commonwealth  Heads  of  Government  Meeting  (CHOGM)  in  Queensland  this  week  prevented  an  accredited  Jewish  observer  seeking  help  for  Zimbabwean  Jews  under  threat  from  President  Robert  Mugabe.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  vice-president  David  Paratz  left  the  conference  venue  in  disgust  when  he  and  30  other  accredited  non-government  observers  (NGOs)  were  confined  to  a  tent  away  from  the  conference  centre  and  barred  from  meeting  Commonwealth   ministers.   Mr  Paratz  was  representing  the  London-based  Commonwealth  Jewish  Council  (CJC)  at  the   conference.   The  37-member  CJC  has  made  representations  on  matters  of  concern  to  Jewish  Commonwealth  communities  at  past  CHOGMs,  and  wanted  to  raise  President  Mugabe’s  threats  to  Jews  in  his  country  as  a  major  concern.   But  Mr  Paratz  had  no  opportunity  to  do  this  at  the  CHOGM  meeting  at  the  Hyatt  Hotel  at  Coolum  on  Queensland’s  Sunshine  Coast  at  the   weekend.   “It  was  a  farce,”  he  told  the  AJN  this  week.  “The  extraordinary   security  arrangements  made  any  free  interchange  with  the  delegates  impossible.  There  was  no  possibility  for  any  external  group  to  have  any   influence.   “Normally,  with  NGO  accreditation,  observers  have  had  free  access  to  the  delegates  at  CHOGM  functions  and  receptions.  This  time  there  was  only  one  official  reception,  and  this  was  on  Shabbat  after  the  official  opening.   “Otherwise,  there  was  zero  opportunity.  The  leaders  were  totally  isolated  from  the  media  and  the  observers,  and  the  only  indication  of  what  was  happening  was  through  media  briefings  twice  a  day.”   Mr  Paratz  said  the  Commonwealth  leaders  met  and  were  accommodated  in  the  main  Hyatt  Hotel  building.  Security  guards  surrounded  the  hotel.   NGOs  and  the  world’s  media  were  accommodated  in  two  marquees  well  away  from  the  hotel,  near  a  golf  course  driving  range.  Security  guards  surrounded  these  tents.   “Accreditation  got  us  into  the  media  tent,  but,  once  in,  we  weren’t  allowed  out,  except  on  security  guarded  shuttle  buses.  One  journalist  called  the  media  tent  Woomera.

"  The  world  hasn't  learned,  warns  international  Jewish  leader   B’NAI  B’rith  International  president  Richard  Heideman  has  warned  that  the  world  has  learned  nothing  from  the  Holocaust  as  he  completes  his  four  years  at  the  helm  with  a  trip  to   Australia  and  New  Zealand.   Attending  the  Australia-New  Zealand  B’nai  B’rith  conference  in  Sydney  this  week,  he  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  the  160  year-old  organisation  has  more  rele  vance  than  ever  in  combatting  hate  in  the  wake  of  September  11  and  the  dramatic  rise  in  antisemitism  since  the  start  of  the  second  intifada  almost  two  years  ago.   “The  last  two  years  show  that  the  world  has  learned  nothing  from  the  Holocaust,  so  we  need  to  teach  our  young  to  speak  out  and  give  them  the  tools  to  defend  the  innocent.”   Identifying  three  significant  events  in  his  term  of  office,  Mr  Heideman  said  the  first  was  his  meeting  at  the  White  House  with  US  President  George  W  Bush  and  Israeli  President   Moshe  Katsav.   “History  will  look  at  that  as  a  form  ative  moment  in  terms  of  George  Bush’s  Middle  East  policy.”   The  second  was  the  preparatory  work  which  B’nai  B’rith  did  in  the  lead-up  to  the  United  Nations’  World  Conference  Against  Racism,  in  Durban  in  August  2001.   As  head  of  the  largest  Jewish  organisation  to  attend  the  forum,  Mr  Heideman  said  he  was  not  surprised  by  the  antisemitism,  having  attended  a  UN  conference  on  women  in  Nairobi  in  1985.   “We  warned  Israeli  Government   officials  and  we  met  US  Secretary  of  State  Colin  Powell,  trying  to  impart  what  I  thought  was  coming.   “We  experienced  the  most  vile  hatred  that  obliterated  any  distinc  tion  between  Israel  and  the  Jews.  It  was  a  telling  moment  leading  to  September  11.”   For  Mr  Heideman,  the  confer  ence’s  most  instructive  moment  was  the  non-response  to  the  headline  in  a  Zimbabwean  newspaper  quoting  President  Robert  Mugabe:  “Mugabe  blames  the  Jews”  for  his  country’s   woes.   “When  it  was  the  moment  for  the  UN  conference  to  stand  up  and  con  demn  this  racism  in  a  country  next  door,  no-one  did.”   Along  with  the  US  and  Israel,  B’nai  B’rith  left  the  conference,  which  made  his  organisation’s  action  the  lead  story  in  the  UN’s  daily  bulletin.   “None  of  us  was  wise  enough   to  understand  the  depth  of  hatred...  I  fear  we  haven't   seen  the  worst.""   Following  the  conference,  Mr  Heideman  and  his  wife  Phyllis  trav  elled  to  Botswana  to  go  on  safari,  and  for  the  first  time  ever  his  mobile  phone’s  screen  display  read  “Number  barred”.  The  day  was  September  11.  Eventually  able  to  contact  his  daugh  ter  in  Washington,  he  learned  of  the   terror  attack.   With  hindsight,  the  signs  of  Osama  bin  Laden’s  growing  confidence  as  he  evaded  capture  while  perpetrating   terror  attacks  were  obvious,  Mr  Heideman  said.   “None  of  us  was  wise  enough  to  understand  the  depth  of  hatred  for  the  US,  Israel  and  the  Jews.  I  fear  we  haven’t  seen  the  worst.”   The  final  significant  event  of  his  presidency  was  the  kidnapping  and  decapitation  of  Wall  Street  Journal  journalist  Daniel  Pearl  in  Pakistan  in  January  2002.  “He  lost  his  life  because  he  was  a  Jew  and  an  American,  and  the  world  did  not  care.”   Labelling  B’nai  B’rith  Australia’s  Courage  to  Care  and  A  Fair  Go  pro  grams  as  outstanding  examples  of  what  can  be  done  to  raise  general  awareness  of  racism,  Mr  Heideman  said  they  need  to  be  internation  alised.  “I  will  suggest  this  at  the  inter  national  conference  next  month  in  San  Francisco.”   Pointing  out  the  need  to  attract  younger  generations  into  Jewish  organisations  as  the  most  significant  challenge  ahead,  he  said  the  values  of  tzedaka  and  giving,  coupled  with  a  sense  of  pride  in  Jewish  culture,  were  the  cornerstone  of  B’nai  B’rith’s  suc  cess  over  the  last  150  years.   Meetings  with  Prime  Minister  John  Howard,  Foreign  Minister  Alexander  Downer,  NSW  Premier  Bob  Carr  and  NSW  Opposition  leader  John  Brogden  have  been  scheduled.   Mr  Heideman  —  who  installed  James  Altman  as  the  new  district   president  of  B’nai  B’rith  Australia  and  New  Zealand  while  in  Sydney  —  will  be  succeeded  as  president  of  B’nai  B’rith  International  by  New  York  lawyer  Joel  Caplan.

"  The  story  behind  the  Australian  Jewish  Herald  affair   VIEWPOINT   Marie  Brabant   IN  a  review  of  Chanan  Reich’s  book   Australia  and  Israel:  an  Ambiguous  Relationship,  Phillip  Mendes  writes  (AW28/06/02):   “There  was  dissent  within  the  Jewish  community  with  the  Australian  Jewish  Herald  being  forced  to  dose  down  following  a  number  of  anti-Zionist  columns  by  journalist  Mark  Braham.”   For  34  years  I  have  had  to  put  up  with  distorted  versions  of  the  Australian  Jewish  Herald  affair,  but  this  is  inexcusable.   The  facts  are  available  in  the  intro  duction  to  my  book,  Jews  Don’t  Hate;  in  a  chapter  of  my  book  Stronger  than  Fiction:  Jews  and  Christians  are  Natural  Allies]  in  various  issues  of  the  Journal  of  the  Australian  Jewish  Historical  Society,  and  the  Archives  of  Australian  Judaica  at  the  Fisher  library  of  the  University  of  Sydney.   Mendes’  statement  is  false   because:   1.  “Anti  Zionism”  today  means  tak  ing  the  side  of  the  Arabs  in  the  war  to  destroy  Israel;  it  is  also  used  as  code  for  antisemitism.  My  columns  were  never  other  than  fully  supportive  of   Israel.   2.  The  Australian  Jewish  Herald  was  not  “forced  to  close”.   As  a  columnist  for  the  Australian  Jewish  Herald  in  Melbourne  and  Australian  Jewish  Times  in  Sydney,  I  wrote  the  same  column,  with  local  differences.   I  wrote  about  the  philosophy  of  Zionism,  not  about  Israel.  The  view  I  put  was  that  secular  and  democratic  “Zionism”  was  a  contradiction  in  terms  and  a  heresy.   The  accusation  that  my  columns  were  anti-Israel  was  a  canard  circu  lated  by  secular  or  non-Orthodox   Zionists.   My  columns  aroused  the  ire,  too,  of  communal  leaders  who  resented  my  attacks  on  the  blatant  manner  in  which  leaders  and  organisations  cre  ated  a  Chillul  Hashem  by  attending  treife  functions.  The  “anti-Israel”  slan  der  was  seized  upon  by  vicious  peo  ple.   These  attacks  have  almost  always  been  based  on  unsubstantiated  reports  of  what  I  am  supposed  to  have  written.  The  “anti-Israel”  columns  are  never  quoted  because  they  never  existed.   Dr  Suzanne  Rutland,  who  dealt  with  the  issue  in  Pages  of  History:  A  Century  of  Australian  Jewish  Press,  quotes  from  the  most  outspoken  of  my  Zionist  articles  and  the  one  that  acted  as  a  catalyst  for  the  attack  of   the  Australian  Jewish  Herald.   I  based  the  theme  on  an  article  in  1934  by  a  Zionist  theoretician,  Professor  Yehezkel  Kaufmann  of  Hebrew  University,  uHurban  Hanefesh:  A  discussion  of  Zionism  and  Anti-Semitism”:   “Even  good  Jews  can  be  permeat  ed  by  anti-Semitism,  which  leads  them  to  this  kind  of  conclusion.  'And  so  you  must  change,  Jews,  and  become  like  every  one  else’.  This  kind  of  Jewish  anti-Semitism  resem  bles  the  most  vicious  form  of  anti  Semitism  in  that  it  attributes  the  Jews’  misfortunes  directly  to  their   own  unattractive  characteristics  and  manners.”   As  for  the  suggestion  that  the  Australian  Jewish  Herald  was  “forced  to  close”  due  to  my  columns,  this  is  a  blatant  untruth.  The  newspaper  was  on  the  verge  of  bankruptcy.   When  die  conspiracy  to  have  me   sacked  as  a  columnist  was  launched,  and  David  Lederman,  owner-editor,  received  an  incredible  letter  from  Nathan  Beller,  president  of  the  Victorian  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  he  saw  an  opportunity  to  close  and  take  members  of  the  VJBD   to  court.   I  was  asked  to  join  the  action,  but  declined  as  I  sought  arbitration  through  the  Sydney  Beth  Din.  The  VJBD  representatives  refused  the   offer.   The  extent  of  the  problems  of  the  newspaper  may  be  gauged  by  the  owner’s  appeal  to  send  him  money  to  give  the  staff  their  holiday  pay.   TTiis  I  did.   Lederman  went  to  Israel  and  the  affair  ended,  but  the  libels  linger.   El  Mark  Braham  is  a  member  of  the  board  of  South  Head  Synagogue. ",2002-07-12
"  HArts   Powerful  Jewish  spin  on  tales  from  the  Arctic   A  Jewish  film-maker  living  in  the  Arctic  has  created  a   stunning,  award-winning  film.  Jan  Epstein  reports.   &amp;SET  in  the  icy  wastes  of  the  Arctic  1000  years   ago,  Atanarjuat—  The  Fast  Runner  tells  the  pri  mal  story  of  evil  dividing  a  community  of  nomadic  Inuits.  Part-fable,  part-cultural  his   tory,  it  has  been  hailed  as  a  masterpiece.   In  its  use  of  amateur  actors  and  sense  of  authenticity,  the  films  has  an  engaging  direct  ness.  But  nothing  prepares  the  viewer  for  Atanarjuat’s  powerful  simplicity  and  the  ravish  ing  beauty  of  its  camera  work.   It  won  the  Camera  d’Or  for  Best  First  Feature  at  the  Cannes  Film  Festival  in  2001.   Behind  director  Zacharias  Kunuk  stands  Igloolik  Isuma  Productions,  a  film  collective  co  founded  in  the  1980s  by  Inuit  film-makers  Kunuk,  Paul  Apak  Angilirq,  Paul  Qulitalik  and  Norman  Cohn,  a  Jewish  video-maker  from  New  York.   Actor  Natar  Ungalaaq  in  Atanarjuat.   Igloolik  is  a  community  of  1200  on  an  island   in  the  Canadian  Arctic.   Since  it  was  founded  15  years  ago,  it  has  cre  ated  a  unique  style  of  experimental  film-making  that  marries  modern  video  techniques  with  the  ancient  Inuit  art  of  storytelling.   Cohn,  55,  has  been  living  in  Igloolik  since  1985.  As  well  as  being  the  collective’s  secre  tary-treasurer,  he  is  Atanarjuafs  producer,  cin  ematographer,  director  of  photography,  co-writer,  co-editor  and  production  manager.   Why  did  this  Jewish  video  artist  adopt  the  Inuits?  Speaking  by  telephone  from  Montreal,  he  said  the  connection  arose  from  the  history  of  their  chosen  medium.   “In  the  1970s  I  was  involved  in  the  use  of  video  as  a  film-making  device.  It  had  to  do  with  video  being  more  accessible  to  people,  partic  ularly  those  who  don’t  have  power  or  money.   “I  was  working  to  use  video  as  a  form  of  social  animation,  trying  to  work  with  people  who  had  something  to  say.   “Ten  years  after  I  started,  my  Inuit  partners  went  through  the  same  process  in  Igloolik.   “The  movement  of  alternative  video  was  a  mixture  of  artists,  hippies  and  social  activists  who  came  out  of  the  ‘60s,  and  thought  you  could  change  the  world  to  make  it  a  better  place.   “By  the  ’80s,  many  social  activists  had  dropped  out.  But  people  were  still  exploring  those  ideas.  Inuit  was  one  of  those  places  where  people  were  being  trained  to  use  video  as  a  way  of  preserving  culture  and  language.”   Cohn  thought  it  curious  that  he  should  dis  cover  people  who  seemed  to  be  on  the  same  track  at  the  farthest  limits  of  the  world.  “It  turned  out  these  Inuit  guys  were  just  like  me.”   Does  Cohn  believe  his  empathy  with  the  Inuits  is  connected  to  his  Jewishness?   “When  I  arrived  in  Igloolik,  I  discovered  that  their  films  looked  like  mine  because  they  were  thinking  like  me  about  certain  things.   Film-maker  Norman  Cohn.   “One  of  these  does  have  a  kinship  with  Jewish  history  in  the  sense  that  the  Inuit  were  coming  from  a  culture  where  dedication  to  community  was  part  of  their  culture  —  a  kind  of  unselfish  commitment  to  a  better  world.”   Cohn  believes  the  commonality  between  Jews  and  Inuit  is  their  commitment  to  working  for  others,  respect  for  history  and  the  instinct  to  preserve  it.   Cohn’s  grandparents  were  Orthodox  Jews.  While  he  had  a  liberal  upbringing,  he  was  acutely  aware  of  Jewish  tradition.   “I  was  the  refusenik  in  our  family,  the  first  to  leave  New  York  and  the  first  to  leave  the  coun   try  and  become  a  Canadian.  Temperamentally,  I  was  the  person  who  was  going  to  do  what  everybody  else  wasn’t.   “But  the  sense  of  the  importance  of  moral  ity  and  community  in  Atanarjuat  reminds  me,  and  certainly  connects  me  nostalgically,  to  my  childhood,  especially  my  grandparents.”   H  Atanarjuat  is  screening  in  Sydney  cinemas.

"  Jewish  lives  don’t  rate  a  mention   by  bishops   Bernard  Freedman   PRIME  Minister  John  Howard  has  condemned  the  Passover  suicide  bombings  in  Israel  as  “the  ultimate  terror”,  and  the  Federal  Opposition  has  called  on  Palestinian  leader  Yasser  Arafat  to  do  more  to  stop  the  terror.   However,  two  church  leaders  —  Anglican  Bishop  George  Browning  and  Auxiliary  Catholic  Bishop  Pat  Power  —  made  no  direct  reference  to  Israeli  civilian  casualties  when  they  called  a  media  conference  in  Canberra  to  express  “grave  concern  at  the  loss  of  human  life,  destruction  of  property  and  escalation  of  violence  in  Palestine”.   Their  comments  drew  an   angry  response  from  Jewish  Federal  MP  Michael  Danby,  who  condemned  the  bishops  as  “hypocrites  and  a  disgrace  to  their  great  religions”.   “How  can  any  so-called  churchmen  fail  to  condemn  the  massacre  of  innocent  Jews  celebrating  a  Passover  seder?”   Bishop  Power:  “So  many  lives  are  being  lost,  whether  they’re  Muslim  lives,  Christian  lives  or  whatever...  We  are  appalled  that  those  lives  are  being  threatened.”   The  bishops  said:  “We  are  appalled  by  the  devastation  being  wreaked  upon  the  Palestinian  people.   “We  call  upon  the  Israeli  Government  to  withdraw  its  forces  from  the  Palestinian  territories.  We  appeal  to  the  Palestinian  people  to  refrain  from  any  acts  of  terrorism.”   The  bishops  called  on  the  US  “to  take  a  more  evenhanded  stance”  and  on  Australia  to  organise  a  peacekeeping  force.  “Without  the  support  of  America  ...  Israel  would  not  be  able  to  continue  its  present  boundaries.”   Mr  Howard  described  the   violence  as  “tragic  beyond  belief.  There  has  to  be  respect  for  Israel’s  position  ...  but  [also]  affirmation  of  the  right  of  the  people  of  Palestine  to  a   homeland.” ",2002-04-05
"  The  young  Jew  Krew   JANET  MYERS   THE  Jewish  community's  first  youth  congress  -  the  Jew  Krew  -  attracted  students  from  far  and  wide.   Organised  by  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  the  congress  aimed  to  find  out  what  Jewish  youth  think  and  feel.   Fifty  students  from  Years  9,  10  and  11  representing  private  and  public  schools,  synagogues  and  youth  movements,  discussed  seri  ous  issues   including  apathy,  antisemitism,  dis  crimination,  drugs  and  alcohol.   Although  students  came  from  Masada  College,  Moriah  College,  Emanuel  School,  Netzer,  Hineni,  Betar,  Habonim  Dror,  B'nai  B'rith  Youth  Organisation,  Reddam  House,  Sydney  Grammar,  Kambala,  Academy  BJE  schools,  Kehillat  Masada  and  Southern  Sydney  Synagogue,  more  than  half  of  the  students  attended  public  schools.

Ideas  included  developing  a  Jewish  youth  website,  creating  a  mural  with  youth  from  other  cul  tures  and  religions,  an  inter-move  ment  information  and  fun  fair  event,  dance  parties,  an  inter-school  day,  sporting  events,  social  action  proj  ects,  and  a  battle  of  the  bands.

"  €  m  Him  m  By   JEW   in  the  dictionary   BEYOND  WORDS   RUTHWAJNRYB   1  “Jewish""  was  what  a  Jew   said  if  he  or  she   wanted  to  take  the  edge  off  “Jew”.   THE  first  time  I  heard  “Jew”   used  differently  from  the  way  I  knew  from  my  home  was  as  a  young  teacher.   I  was  teaching  a  large  class  with  a  reputation  for  being  “noisy”  and  “dif  ficult”.  The  very  last  thing  they  want  ed  in  their  lives  was  English  literature.   Enter  Ruth.  I  was  moving  about  the  room,  trying  to  keep  bodies  in  chairs  and  minds  on  task.  Nearby  a  boy  caught  my  attention.  He’d  just  hurled  “You  bloody  Jew”  at  another  kid.  I  approached  and  gently  asked:  “Why  did  you  call  him  that?”   “He’s  a  Jew,  Miss.  He  took  my  rub  ber  [eraser]”.   “But  why  is  he  a  ‘Jew’?”   The  facial  expression  said  it  all:  gee  Miss,  what  planet  are  you  from?  He  retorted,  “Jews  are  people  who  don’t  give  your  rubbers  back.”   Before  this,  I’d  only  heard  “Jew”  used  positively  and  proudly.  “I’m  a  Jew,”  my  father  would  say  to  anyone  who  asked  him,  and  even  those  who  didn’t.  He  eschewed  the  adjectival  equivalent  (“Jewish”)  disliking  the  “ish”  ending,  arguing  “Jewish”  was  different  from  “Swedish”,  “Polish”,  “Turkish”  and  the  like.  He  maintained  “ish”  lent  an  approximate,  even  hedg  ing  quality  e.g.  “moreish”,  “blueish”,  “peckish”,  “coldish”,  “oldish”,  “sweet  ish”,  “loudish”.   So  something  “bluish”  was  less  than  fully  blue.  “Peckish”  was  politely  short  of  downright  hungry.   “Moreish”  was  gently  gluttonous.  Yes,  these  words  had  a  certain  quaintness,  but  they  were  also  a  tad  shy  of  100  per  cent.  By  my  dad’s  logic,  “Jewish”  was  what  a  Jew  said  if  he  or  she  wanted  to  take  the  edge  off  “Jew”.   Post-Holocaust,  he  was  not  into  softening  the  impact  of  his  identity  for  the  comfort  of  those  who  might  be  less  than  completely  tranquil  in  the  com  pany  of  a  fully-fledged  Jew.  In  this  regard,  he  was  —  forgive  the  incongru  ence  —  more  Catholic  than  the  Pope,  seeking  out  (even  inappropriate)  opportunities  to  shout  from  the  rafters  why  he  was  proud  of  who  he  was.   The  linguistics  of  “ish”  may  be  even  more  complex.  It  can  carry  derogatory  associations.  If  you  describe  someone  as  “bookish”,  you’re  commenting  less  on  their  erudition  than  on  what  they’re  not  doing  with  their  life.  “Childish”  is  pejorative  (unlike  “childlike”).  Others,  like  “fool  ish”,  “freakish”,  “priggish”  and  “selfish”  are  more  numerous  than  the  excep  tions  (“boyish”).  And  then  there’s  “goyish”,  which  is  not,  of  course,  an  example  listed  in  Oxford  University’s  Ologies  and  Isms.   The  word  “Jew”  in  the  non-Jewish  Anglo  world  is  riddled  with  offensive   connotations.  Don’t  believe  me?  Go   on.  Open  your  dictionary.  Which  dic  tionary?  Any  dictionary.  It’s  a  real  eye   opener.   At  a  surface,  denotative  level,  there  are  glosses  like:  “One  of  the  Hebrew  or  Jewish  people”,  “one  whose  religion  is  Judaism”,  or  “pertaining  to  the  Jews  or  Hebrews”  (for  example,  Macquarie  Dictionary).  Fan  enough.  Some  dic  tionaries,  such  as  Collins,  stop  at  the   denotation.   For  most,  however,  that’s  the  start  ing  point.  From  there  the  waters  get  increasingly  murky.  Just  beyond  surface  level,  we  start  wading  in  a  mire  of  unconcealed  bigotry.  The   dictionaries,  of  course,  strain  to  dis  tance  themselves,  ideologically,  from  the  connotations  listed.  This  they  do  by  corralling  the  terms  off  as  “collo  quial”  or  “derogatory”  (Macquarie)  or  “offensive”  or  other  markers  of  the   politically  incorrect  (for  example,  Chambers).  Sometimes  there’s  a  pre  liminary  historical  explanation:  “The  stereotype,  which  is  now  deeply  offensive,  arose  from  historical  associ  ations  of  Jews  as  moneylenders  in  medieval  England”  (Readers’  Digest  Oxford  Complete  Wordftnder).  The  Oxford  has:  “The  name  of  Jew  came  to  be  associated  ...  with  extortionate   practices  ...  and  gained  an  opprobri   ous  sense.”   Behold  then  the  Jew  as  “usurer”  or  “miser”  (Chambers),  “parsimonious”,  “one  who  drives  a  hard   bargain”(Macq«flne)  or  “deals  craft  ly”  (Oxford).  More  cutting  yet  is  the  verb  “to  Jew”:  “to  beat  down  in  price”,  “to  cheat”,  “to  gain  financial  advan  tage  over”  (Chambers).   Ugliness  proliferates  in  the  lateral  labelling.  There’s  a  “Jew  lizard”,  a  rep  tile  with  an  apparent  beard-like  fea  ture.  “Hairy  Jew’s  ear”  is  a  tropical  fungus  “found  on  rotting  logs  where  it  grows  in  glistening  ...  ears  and  is  parasitic  on  other  trees”  (Macquarie).  The  “Jew’s  harp”  consists  of  a  circular  frame  with  a  metal  tongue  which  is   plucked  while  the  frame  is  held  between  the  teeth  (Macquarie).  (An  Oxford  lexicographer  suggest  it’s  a  “name  given  in  derision,  probably  in  reference  to  the  harp  of  David”;  another  says  it’s  an  error  -  “Jew”  for  “jaw”)   A  “Jew’s  eye”  means  “precious”  (in  Shakespeare,  “worth  a  Jew’s  eye”),  derived  from  the  practice  of  torturing  Jews  for  money.  “Wandering  Jew”  refers  to  several  creeping  pesky  plants  -  the  difference  between  a  “plant  and  a  “weed”  is  that  a  weed  is  a  plant  that  you  don’t  want  in  your  garden.   “Wandering  Jew”  derives  from  the  legendary  medieval  character  con  demned  to  wander  the  earth  until  Christ’s  second  coming  (Macquarie).  -Why?

"  Jew  for  Dutch  PM?   THE  HAGUE  —  Only  four  days  before  Dutch  general  elections,  the  Labour  Party  has  stunned  the  electorate  by  changing  its  candidate  for  prime  minister.  On  Sunday,  it  nominated  Amsterdam’s  Jewish  mayor,  Job  Cohen,  as  the  candidate  in  Tuesday’s  elections.   Cohen’s  parents  were  born  in  the  Netherlands  and  survived  the  Holocaust  in  hiding,  but  at  least  one  set  of  his  grandparents  were  killed  by  the  Nazis.  If  elect  ed,  he  would  be  the  world’s  only  Jewish  prime  minister  outside   Israel.   The  previous  leader  Wouter  Bos  named  Cohen  as  his  replacement,  saying  he’d  rather  stay  in  parliament  even  if  the  Social  Democrats  win  the  elec  tions  and  form  the  government.

"  BELFAST’S  ONLY  CHASSIDIC  JEW   ANDREW  MORRIS   BELFAST-There  is  a  new  religious  leader  in  Northern  Ireland's  capital,  a  city  long   divided  by  a  Protestant-Catholic  rift.  But   he’s  not  Christian.   Avraham  Citron,  a  26-year-old  Lubavitch  rabbi  from  Los  Angeles,  is  the  only  Jewish  clergyman  in  all  of  Northern  Ireland,  also  called  Ulster.  In  the  last  few  months,  he  has  become  Ulster's  unofficial  chief  rabbi.   “It's  a  heavy-sounding  title,”  Rabbi  Citron  says,  ""but  yes,  I  guess  I'm  the  only  one.”  In  a  community  that  every  year  sees  dwindling  membership  at  the  city’s  sole  synagogue,  Rabbi  Citron  is  the  first  full-time  rabbi  in  town  in  a  long  time.   Before  Rabbi  Citron’s  promotion  -  he  worked  in  Belfast  for  six  months  on  a  part-time  basis  before  his  appointment  the  community’s  spiritual  needs  were  met  by  a  lay  leader.  But  Jewish  community  enthusiasm  and  numbers  were  waning.   An  estimated  80  per  cent  of  the  Jewish  community  here  is  elderly.  Rabbi  Citron’s  appointment  was  a  “shot  in  the  arm  for  the  community”,  says  Cyril  Rosenbeig,  a  local  businessman  who  leads  tours  of  Belfast’s  synagogue  for  local  church  and  school  geups.  “We  hope  he  can  get  the  young  people  involved  and  deliver  the  Yiddishkeit  goods.”   Nobody,  especially  Belfast’s  rabbi,  has  ary  illusions  that  this  once-large  British  Jewish  community  can  ever  compete  with  England.  But  many  hope   that  this  community,  which  has  dwindled  '  to  600  people  from  a  peak  of  16,000  in  the  1960s,  can  revitalise  itself.   Chabad  rabbis  do  revitalisation  and  outreach  work  in  far-flung  Jewish  communities  all  over  the  world.  “Is  there  a  future  for  Belfast’s  Jews?  I  certainly  think  there  can  be,”  Rabbi  Citron  says  enthusiastically.  “I  think  people  are  definitely  open  to  having  a  thriving,  well-organised  community.  Even  those   people  we  never  see  in  shul  seem  quite  ..  receptive  to  coming  to  the  rabbi’s  house   for  dinner?   Getting  Ulster's  Jews  into  the  synagogue  is  something  the  rabbi  says  he  will  have  to  work  on:  the  average  turnout  for  Saturday  services  is  30.   But  there  are  signs  that  some  younger  Jews  are  taking  an  interest  in  Judaism.  So  far,  10  children  are  enrolled  in  the  synagogue’s  Sunday  school,  and  Rabbi  Citron  is  planning  to  add  another  class,  bringing  the  student  total  to  15.   ""It’s  a  small  but  important  step  forward,”  Rabbi  Citron  says.  He  and  his  wife  Devorah  have  two  young  children.   The  synagogue’s  chief  caretaker,  Adrian  Levy,  describes  the  city’s  lone  synagogue  as  an  “umbrella  community”,  though  it  is  under  the  banner  of  the  United  Synagogue,  an  Orthodox  group.   “Our  services  are  modem  Orthodox,  but  we're  definitely  inclusive  in  our  outlook,”  Levy  says.   Belfast’s  only  Chassidic  Jew  says  he  •  feels  safe.  “I’ve  never  had  any  troubles  walking  around,”  Rabbi  Citron  says.  “Of  course,  people  who  see  me  often  stop  and  stare,  but  I’m  sure  this  is  mere  curiosity  rather  than  antisemitism.  After  all,  nobody  looks  like  the  rabbi.""   JTA ",2003-06-27

"  Jew  beaten  to   death  in  Russia   LEV  KRICHEVSKY   MOSCOW  -  There  are  new  calls  for  increased  security  at  Jewish  institu  tions  in  Russia  after  two  Jews  were  beaten,  one  fatally,  in  recent  weeks.   “This  would  have  never  happened  if  we  had  security  guards  here,”  said  Mikhail  Korytniy,  chief  administrator  at  the  Ohalei  Ya’akov  yeshiva  in  downtown  Moscow.  Robert  Ami   nashvili,  25,  died  last  Tuesday  of  a  severe  beating  on  a  Moscow  street  after  he  left  the  yeshiva  after  the  con  clusion  of  Yom  Kippur.   Aminashvili’s  body  was  to  be  flown  to  Israel  on  Thursday  for  bur  ial.  Korytniy  said  that  weeks  before  Aminashvili  was  beaten  to  death,  two  school  officials  cancelled  a  contract  with  private  security  guards  in  order  to  save  money.   Leading  Russian  Jewish  officials  have  not  spoken  publicly  about  the  incident,  which  went  unreported  in   the  Russian  media.   In  a  similar  attack  last  week,  a  US  bom  Israeli  yeshiva  student  suffered  head  injuries  in  a  night-time  beating   on  a  Russian  street.   Those  familiar  with  the  attack  on  Aminashvili  said  he  was  drunk  when   he  and  a  friend  left  to  go  to  a  nearby  store  to  get  alcohol  in  the  early  hours   of  October  7.   “It  all  remains  unclear,  but  we   understand  that  the  guys  were  drunk,  they  met  some  other  guys  and  they  got  into  a  fight,”  Korytniy  said.   He  said  yeshiva  officials  do  not  believe  antisemitism  motivated  the  attack  because  Aminashvili  did  not   have  a  beard  and  was  not  wearing  a  yarmulke  or  other  garb  that  would  have  identified  him  as  Jewish.   Yeshiva  officials  do  not  believe  antisemitism  motivated  the  attack   because  Aminashvili  did  not  have  a  beard  and  was  not  wearing  a   yarmulke  or  other  garb  that  would  have   identified  him  as  Jewish.   The  yeshiva’s  rabbinic  authorities  and  other  Jewish  officials  refused  to  talk  to  the  media  about  the  tragedy.   The  friend  who  was  with  Ami  nashvili,  yeshiva  student  Rahamim  Peisakhov,  left  for  Israel  after  Ami  nashvili  died.  Peisakhov  reportedly  was  not  injured.   A  native  of  the  former  Soviet   republic  of  Georgia  and  a  religious  Jew,  Aminashvili  had  immigrated  to  Israel  but  recently  had  been  spending   most  or  his  time  m  Moscow.

Ginzburg,  87,  has  been  a  member  of  the  board  of  directors  of  the  Russ  ian  Jewish  Congress  (RJC)  since  the  organisation  was  started  in  1996.  He’s  the  oldest  member  of  the  group’s  Public  Advisory  Council,  which  is  made  up  of  prominent  figures  in  arts,  science  and  sports,   i  The  scientist  is  well  known  for  his   passionate  stand  against  antisemitism  and  his  support  of  secular  Jewish  identity  and  the  State  of  Israel.  RJC  leaders  described  Ginzburg  as  one  of  the  most  active  and  passionate  men  among  the  group’s  lay  leadership.   “He  is  one  of  those  Jewish  leaders  who  is  extremely  active  in  propagat  ing  the  idea  of  a  secular  Jewry,”  said  Yevgeny  Satanovsky,  the  RJC’s  presi   dent   Ginzburg  was  given  the  prize  “for  pioneering  contributions  to  the  theo  ry  of  superconductors  and  super  fluids”,  according  to  a  release  by  the  Nobel  Prize  committee.  He  will  share  the  prize  with  another  Russian  scien  tist  Alexei  Abrikosov,  now  working  in   the  United  States,  and  a  British-born  American  researcher,  Anthony  Leggett.   A  physicist  and  astrophysicist,  Ginzburg  has  worked  at  the  Moscow  based  Lebedev  Physical  Institute  since  1940.  He  also  taught  at  Gorky  State  University.   His  academic  work  has  included   research  into  superconductivity,  theo  ries  of  radio-wave  propagation,  radio  astronomy  and  the  origin  of  cosmic   rays.   Early  in  his  career,  Ginzburg  was   an  ardent  believer  in  science  and  a  critic  of  religious  worldviews.  To  his  credit,  Jewish  leaders  say,  such  views  did  not  preclude  a  deep  devotion  to   the  Jewish  people.  Ginzburg  never  shunned  his  Jewish  background,  even  though  in  recent  years  he  has  become  especially  active  in  his  atheism,  pub  lishing  several  articles  on  the  subject   Ginzburg  is  co-chairman  of  the  Society  for  Solidarity  With  the  People  of  Israel,  a  pro-Israel  advocacy  group  of  Russian  Jews  created  in  2002  to  enlist  Russian  public  support  for   IsraeL   In  a  telephone  interview  on  Tues  day  evening,  hours  after  his  share  of  the  $US1.3  million  prize  was  announced,  Ginzburg  said  he  would  give  the  money  to  his  young  great   grandsons.

The  cartoon  in  the  Independent  newspaper  showed  Sharon  crouched  in  the  ruins  of  a  village,  biting  the  head  off  a  baby  as  helicopters  circle  overhead  broadcast  ing  the  message  “Vote  Sharon”.   ""What’s  wrong  ...  You  never  seen  a  politician  kissing  babies  before?”  Sharon  asks  in  the  drawing.

And  throughout  his  career,  Hope  employed  Jewish  writers.

"  World   Jew  to  lead  British  Conservative  Party   RICHARD  ALLEN  GREENE   LONDON  -  A  former  hardline  gov   ernment  minister  has  become  the   first  Jew  ever  to  lead  a  major  British  political  party.   Michael  Howard,  62,  was  declared  the  leader  of  Britain’s  Opposition  Conservative  Party  last  Thursday.  None  came  forward  to  challenge  him  after  the  party  dumped  its  previous  leader,  Iain  Duncan  Smith.   Geoffrey  Alderman,  a  historian  of  British  Jewry,  said  Howard’s  candida  cy  carried  symbolic  importance  for  Britain’s  Jews  but  probably  would  not  bear  tangible  benefits.   There  was  speculation  that  a  Jew  ish  prime  minister  in  Britain  could  be  detrimental  to  the  Jewish  communi  ty,  expressing  similar  concerns  to  those  voiced  by  some  US  Jews  dining  the  2000  vice-presidential  run  of  Sen  ator  Joseph  Lieberman.   Alderman  said  that  if  Lieberman  had  become  vice-president,  some  Jews  were  worried  he  would  have  had  to  “bend  over  backwards  on  the  Mid   dle  East”  to  prove  that  his  religion  was  not  a  factor  in  determining  US  policy.   “Michael  Howard  would  also  be  under  such  pressures”  if  he  became  Britain’s  prime  minister,  Alderman  said.  “It  is  of  more  benefit  to  Anglo  Jewry  to  have  a  prime  minister  who  represents  a  Jewish  constituency  than  to  have  a  prime  minister  who  is  a  pro  fessing  Jew.”   Alderman  cited  the  example  of  former  prime  minister  Margaret  Thatcher,  who  represented  the  heavi  ly  Jewish  London  constituency  of  Finchley.   “She  made  friends  with  the  Jews  and  she  never  looked  back,”  he  said.  At  one  time,  Thatcher  had  five  Jews  in  her  cabinet  -  more  than  anyone   before  or  since.   Stuart  Polak,  director  of  the  Con  servative  Friends  of  Israel  lobbying  group,  rejected  Alderman’s  sugges  tion  that  Howard  might  be  con  strained  by  his  Judaism.   “It  happens  to  an  extent,  but  the  bottom  line  is  that  Michael  Howard  is  someone  who  will  never  sell  the  issues   that  affect  the  Jewish  community  or  Israel  down  the  river,”  he  said.  “We  have  somebody  who  understands  the   New  British  Conservative  Party  Leader   Michael  Howard.  Photo:  AAP/AP   issues  affecting  the  Jewish  communi  ty  better  than  most.”   The  Conservatives  have  had  an  ethnic  Jewish  leader  before,  the  great  19th-century  prime  minister,  Ben  jamin  Disraeli.  But  Disraeli  was  bap  tised  a  Christian  long  before  he  entered  politics.   After  Disraeli,  there  were  no  Jew  ish  Conservative  lawmakers  for  gen  erations.  But  the  anticipated  selection  of  Howard  to  lead  the  party  more  than  120  years  after  Disraeli  has  raised  no  apparent  concerns.   “Jewish  values...  are  still   an  important  guide  and  influence  on  my  life.”   MICHAEL  HOWARD   British  Conservative  Party  leader   The  British  press  has  noted  his  immigrant  background  -  his  father  came  to  Wales  from  Romania  in  1939,  and  one  of  his  grandmothers  died  in  Auschwitz  -  but  has  had  little  to  say  about  his  Jewishness.   For  his  part,  Howard  has  made  lit  tle  of  his  religion,  neither  hiding  it  nor  making  overt  displays  of  it  In  Sep  tember,  he  told  the  London  Jewish  Chronicle  that  he  “accepted  those  Jew  ish  values  I  was  brought  up  with.

Now  imagine  the  plight  of  a  Jew  planning  his  escape.   Iraq  places  severe  restrictions  on   citizens  who  want  to  leave  the   country  -  and  the  few  remaining  Jews  are  not  permitted  to  leave,  according  to  the  American  Jewish  Joint  Distribution  Committee.   For  “Jacob”  -  not  his  real  name  -  a  shy  man  in  his  mid-50s  who  has  spent  a  lifetime  in  Baghdad  keeping  quiet  about  his  Jewish  identity,  staying  was  riskier  than  leaving.   Jacob’s  recent  retirement  as  a  gov  ernment  engineer  meant  two  things:   •  He  could  now  obtain  a  passport,  a  privilege  previously  forbidden   because  of  the  nature  of  his  work.   •  He  may,  however,  have  outlived  his  usefulness  to  the  regime,  he  told  the  Hebrew  Immigrant  Aid  Society  (HIAS).   Given  the  history  of  antisemitism  in  Iraq,  and  the  widely-held  view  in  the  Arab  world  that  the  war  is  being   waged  at  Israel’s  behest,  Jacob  thought  he  might  be  in  danger  when  war  broke  out,  a  HIAS  source  said.   With  Iraq  distracted  by  the  build  up  of  US  troops  along  its  borders,  Jacob  crossed  the  frontier  just  days  before  America  began  raining  bombs  on  the  country.   His  wish  was  to  join  his  sister  and  her  family,  who  fled  Iraq  two  years  ago  for  a  Western  European  country.   Copying  their  escape  route  through  a  neighbouring  country,  Jacob  posed  as  a  non-Jewish  Iraqi  and  lived  with  a  Christian  Arab  family  once  outside  Iraq.   He  immediately  informed  his  sis  ter  of  his  whereabouts,  and  she  relayed  the  information  to  HIAS.   A  week  later,  an  undercover  HIAS  official  met  Jacob  in  his  country  of  refuge  and  put  him  on  a  flight  to  Europe,  where  he  now  waits  in  an  apartment  secured  by  HIAS  and  JDC.   HIAS  is  seeking  special  refugee  status  for  Jacob  from  the  UN  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees  so  that  he  can  reach  his  hoped-for  destination.   Jacob  could  get  the  special  refugee  status  within  a  week,  but  it  might  take  him  several  months  to  actually  move,  as  his  country  of  destination  has  a  lengthy  procedure  for  processing   refugees,  according  to  HIAS.

"  Terrorism  insurance  for  Jewish  property   ALLON  LEE   AUSTRALIAN  Jewish  leaders  have  welcomed  the  Federal  Government’s  decision  to  include  the  insurance  of  non-commercial  buildings  -  such  as  synagogues  -  against  terrorism  in  the   Terrorism  Insurance  Act  2003.   Passed  in  parliament  this  week,  the  law  means  that  the  government  is  enforcing  insurance  companies  to  cover  acts  of  terrorism  in  their  policies.   A  one  per  cent  levy  will  be  imposed  on  insurance  policies  which  previous  ly  excluded  terrorist  attacks.  The   funds  will  be  administered  by  a  corpo-  ration  set  up  by  the  government.   The  government  initially  proposed  that  the  scheme  would  cover  only  commercial  buildings,  but  concerted  efforts  by  the  Jewish  community  resulted  in  the  legislation  including  non-commercial  buildings.   Congratulating  the  government  for  ensuring  that  all  buildings  are  covered  against  terrorism,  NSW  Jew-  ish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman  noted  that  insur-  ance  problems  still  exist  for  the  Jewish   community,  particularly  because  of  significant  hikes  in  insurance  premi-   ums.   An  estimated  20-30  Jewish  institu  tions  have  been  affected  in  Sydney,  including  schools,  synagogues,  retire  ment  homes  and  community  centres.  Some,  such  as  the  Great  Synagogue,  have  seen  their  premiums  rocket  by  700-800  per  cent  since  September  11.   In  Melbourne  insurance  premi-  ums  have  risen  for  more  than  50  Jew-  ish  institutions.   Rothman  noted  that  the  result  was  achieved  through  “a  bipartisan  approach”  which  included  the  co-oper-  ation  of  the  Federal  Labor  Opposition  and  the  NSW  Labor  Government.   Representations  were  made  by  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  and  the  Board  of  Deputies  to  the  Federal  Government  and  to  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  by  a  delegation  at  the  end  of  last  year,  as  well  as  through  meetings  with  the  ministers  for  Immigration,  Multicultural  and  Indigenous  Affairs  and  citizenship.   Further  representations  were  made   Machzika  HaTorah  (Roscoe  Street)   Synagogue  president  Ewaz  Barukh  after  the  Bondi  synagogue  was  attacked  in   November  2000.  On  the  floor  are  burnt  prayer-shawls.   to  the  NSW  Government,  including  to  Premier  Bob  Carr  and  the  Minister  Assisting  on  Citizenship,  John  Hatzistergos,  as  well  as  to  the  NSW  Community  Relations  Commission.   The  Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victoria  also  lodged  submissions   with  the  Victorian  Government.   ECAJ  president  Jeremy  Jones  said   the  inclusion  of  terrorism  insurance  was  a  small  step  in  the  ongoing  cam  paign  against  terrorism.   “It  is  good  to  see  that  the  govern  ment  is  taking  seriously  the  threats  to  security,”  he  said.   “Extending  that  principle  to  reli  gious  and  institutions  is  right  This  will  hopefully  make  insurance  cheaper.   “But  it  is  more  important  for  the  government  to  focus  upon  preven  tion  of  terrorist  attacks.  We  need  more  security.   “The  ideal  situation  is  where  we  never  need  terrorism  insurance,  and  in  that  area  more  needs  to  be  done.  Protection  and  prevention  are  the  best  security  measures  for  all  Australians.”   Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victoria  president  Michael  Lipshutz   said  the  inclusion  of  terrorism  insur  ance  was  more  important  now  than  ever.  “The  right  to  worship  one’s  religion  is  a  right  that  should  be  enjoyed  by  all  Australians,”  he  said.  “This  inclusion  should  be  applauded.” ",2003-06-20

"  Natan  Kuchar  with  his  grandmother  Duci  Schwartz  and  mother  Dianne  Kuchar  at  the  McDonald’s  Performing  Arts  Challenge.   JACQUiGAL   FIFTEEN-year-old  musician  Natan  Kuchar  is  on  his  way,  musically  speak  ing.  He  has  already  produced  two  CDs  on  which  he  wrote  and  arranged  10  of  his  own  songs,  and  he  is  not  afraid  of  some  tough  competition.   Kuchar  won  a  gold  medal  for  first  place  in  the  recent  McDonald's  Performing  Arts  Challenge  in  the  15  and  16-year-old  category,  singing  Stevie  Wonder's  You  are  the  Sunshine  of  My  Life  and  accompanying  himself  on  the  piano.   In  the  open  age  competition  he  placed  second  out  of  28  competitors  (with  some  aged  up  to  38),  playing  and  singing  his  own  composition,  With  Your  Eyes.   Kuchar  cites  Stevie  Wonder  as  his  hero,  but  says  indie  pop  musician  Jason  Moraz  is  also  ""really  good"".  Kuchar  may  well  be  his  own  kind  of  hero  as  he  wears  a  kippah  whenever  he  com  petes.   ""I  wear  it  for  two  reasons,""  he  explained.   ""It  has  a  picture  of  a  piano  on  it,  but  also  it's  because  I  want  to  show  that   I'm  a  proud  Jew.   ""Maybe  there  will  only  be  one  other  Jew  in  the  competition,  but  when  I  suc  ceed  it  shows  that  the  Jews  are  here  and  we're  doing  well.""   Not  that  Kuchar  did  so  well  in  his  first  performance.   ""It  was  terrible,""  he  said.   ""It  was  a  Purim  talent  quest  at  Hakoah  Club,  I  was  six  years  old  and  I  danced.  It  was  the  most  pathetic  thing  I  have  done  in  my  life.  Even  though  I  didn't  know  what  I  was  doing  and  I  got  no  award,  it  somehow  made  me  want  to  come  back  the  next  year.   ""I  did  a  Phantom  of  the  Opera  piece  the  next  time  and  was  awarded  a  high  distinction.  It  made  me  see  that  I  could  do  this.""   Playing  a  black  Yamaha  upright  at  home,  Kuchar  hopes  to  pursue  a  career   in  entertainment.   ""I'll  start  off  doing  small  stuff,  like  bar  mitzvahs  and  then  write  my  own  songs.  I'll  publish  them  here  and  then  try  to  tap  into  the  overseas  market.""

"  WE'VE  all  heard  the  same  complaint  from  Jewish  singles:  ""There  is  nowhere  for  Jews  to  meet  each  other,""  or  ""There  are  no  decent  Jewish  singles  left  out  there""   Enter  ""Jewish  Fast  Date"",  the  latest  craze  to  hit  the  Jewish  singles  scene.   Originally  developed  by  an  American  rabbi  in  1998,  fast  dating  (or  speed  dating  as  it's  known  worldwide)  is  a  fun  and  entertaining  way  to  meet  like-minded  singles.   The  basic  premise  involves  an  equal  num  ber  of  single  girls  and  guys  meeting  in  a  bar  and  spending  eight  minutes  with  each  other.  After  eight  minutes,  a  bell  rings  and  you  move  along  to  the  next  eagerly  awaiting  sin  gle,  and  as  you  move,  you  note  down  on  a  match-up  card  whether  you'd  like  to  see  that  person  again.  If  both  people  indicate  they  do,  then  emails  go  out  the  next  day  with  phone  numbers  so  you  can  contact  each  other.  After  90  minutes  you've  met  at  least  10  sin  gles.   Fast  Date  is  Australia's  largest  speed  dat  ing  organiser  and  has  been  conducting  events  in  Sydney  and  Melbourne  for  the  past  three  years.   Organiser  Gil  Avenaim  said:  ""It  was  time  we  made  it  easier  for  single  Jews  to  meet  here  in  Australia,  and  after  having  so  much  success  with  other  groups,  the  timing  was  right  to  kick  start  Jewish  Fast  Date.""   Rabbi  Mendel  Kastel  from  the  Great  Synagogue  said:  ""Gil  approached  me  with   Participants  in  Fast  Date.   the  idea  and  we  thought  it  was  a  sensation  al  way  for  getting  single  Jews  together.  Going  to  the  odd  dance  party  or  social  get  together  isn't  enough.  We  need  to  get  Jews  meeting  and  talking  and  Fast  Date  allows  this  to  happen,  and  even  if  you  don't  meet  your  'perfect  match'  you  can  certainly  build  up  your  social  circle  every  quickly.""   Jewish  Fast  Date  is  targeted  to  single  Jews   25  to  50  years  of  age,  and  all  participants  will  meet  singles  of  their  own  age  group.   Jewish  Fast  Date  launches  on  August  26  at  Cube  Cafe,  George  Street,  Sydney,  and  will  cost  $35,  which  includes  a  drink  on  arrival.

"  Ukrainian  Jewish   leader  ‘excommunicated’   DANIEL  IVIACISAAC   KIEV  -  A  thorn  in  the  side  of  the  authorities  during  Soviet  days,  Jewish  community  representative  Josef  Zissels  is  now  pricking  Ukrainian  Jewish  leaders  -  so  much  so  that  they’ve  declared  him  persona  non  grata.   Following  months  of  warnings,  the  Council  of  Leaders  of  All-Ukrainian  (Major)  Jewish  Organisations  on  June  24  took  the  unprecedented  step  of  publicly  declaring  Zissels  “persona  non  grata”,  with  “no  right  to  represent  the  Jewish  community  of  Ukraine  before  Ukrainian,  international  and  foreign  governmental,  state,  public,  NGO,  national  or  religious  organisations”.   “The  council  unanimously   considers  that  Mr  Zissels’  activities  have  brought  irreparable  harm  to  the  authority,  unity  and  integrity  of  the  Jewish  community  of  Ukraine,  and  strongly  condemns  it,”  the  declaration  reads,  adding  that  his  activity  also  “promotes  antisemitism  and  inter-ethnic  intolerance”.   At  issue  is  Zissels’  lobbying  against  a  memorial  and  community  centre  planned  for  Babi  Yar,  the  ravine  on  the  outskirts  of  Kiev  where  33,000  Jews  were  slaughtered  in  September  1941.   Formed  at  the  beginning  of  2003,  the  Council  of  Leaders  is  designed  to  bring  together  representatives  of  the  various  groups  representing  Ukraine’s   Josef  Zisseis  has  been  declared   “persona  non  grata”.

The  council  leaders  support  the   construction  of  the  multi-million   dollar  heritage  complex  memorial  and  centre,  funded  by  the  American  Jewish  Joint  Distribution  Committee  and  planned  for  Babi  Yar.   Zissels  has  been  among  the  most  vocal  opponents  of  the  project,  argu  ing  that  the  “mass  grave”  that  is  Babi  Yar  is  no  place  for  a  community  centre.  He  was  instrumental  in  taking  the  debate  public  in  the  spring  of  2002.   Since  members  of  other  minority  groups  also  were  killed  at  Babi  Yar,  any   memorial  should  be  multi-ethnic  in  nature,  Zissels  and  other  critics  argue.   Protest  letters  have  included  signatures  of  people  from  a  number  of  ethnic  groups,  including  Armenians   and  Koma,  or  gypsies.   JTA ",2003-07-25

"  Rebel  for  Jewish  causes   DAVID  LANGSAM   THERE  are  few  people  who  will  be  missed  by  organisations  as  diverse  as  the  Communist  Party  of  Australia,  the  Melbourne  Hebrew  Congregation,  the  Jewish  Holocaust  Centre,  the  Australian  Jewish  Democratic  Society  and  the  Kadimah  Theatre.  Mark  Langsam  bridged  those  apparent  cultural  divides.   Born  in  Warsaw  in  1915,  the  youngest  child  of  a  shoemaker,  he  gained  entry  to  a  Jewish  ""gymnasium""  but  his  formal  education  was  abruptly  terminated  when  he  was  outed  for  starting  a  cell  of  the  Hashomer  Hatzayir  youth  movement.  Signing-up  the  headmaster's  son  was  typical  of  his  chutzpah  and  activism.   In  1936,  well-aware  of  the  rise  of  Nazism  to  the  west,  Mark  (known  to  his  closest  friends  as  Kuba,  the  diminutive  of  Akiwa),  sat  on  a  hill  looking  east  to  the  Soviet  Union.  The  young  communist  debated  whether  to  join  the  prole  tariat  revolution  or  seek  adventure  in  the  fron  tier  land  of  Australia.   This  writer  is  grateful  that  he  chose  the  lat  ter.  Informing  his  girlfriend  Raya  Bak  of  his  deci  sion,  in  November  1936  they  married  so  she  could  join  him  for  their  60-year  adventure  together.  A  month  later  he  set  sail  for  Australia  to  join  his  older  brother,  Simon  Lang,  in  the  Goulburn  Valley.  Raya  followed  the  next  year  travelling  with  the  eldest  of  the  Langsam  boys,  Benzion,  his  wife  Pola  and  son  Isaac.  With  few  exceptions  the  rest  of  their  families  would  per   ish  in  the  Holocaust.   Mark  was  living  in  Carlton  awaiting  the  arrival  of  his  Ruchla.  On  strong  advice  from  friend,  Yosl  Bergner,  he  replaced  the  portrait  of  Karl  Marx  in  his  room  with  one  of  his  bride.  He  was  well-known  for  this  sort  of  sensitivity.   Their  Australian  working  lives  began  in  other  people's  factories  -  including  Mark's  memorable  war  years  packing  sausages  for  the  Smorgons  -  owning  a  milk  bar  and  eventually  their  own  clothing  factory.  Daughter  Ann  was  bom  in  1938,  Victor  followed  in  1942  and  this   writer  in  1953.   Mark  constantly  wrote  letters  seeking  fami  ly  scattered  around  the  globe  by  the  war.  He  maintained  contact  with  mishpucha  from  Sweden  and  France  to  Israel,  the  USA  and  South  America.   Family  gatherings  -  even  working  week  din  ners  -  were  mere  vehicles  for  raging  political  and  social  debate  and  if  a  topic  looked  like  being  exhausted,  Mark  would  ask  the  table:  ""What  about  the  problems  of  the  Jews  in  the  Soviet  Union?""  He  wrote  to  the  Communist   AKIWA  MARK  LANGSAM   1915  -  2003   Party  Tribune  defending  Israel.   He  never  wavered  in  his  passion  for  a  Jewish  homeland,  nor  his  concern  for  social  equality.  He  visited  Alice  Springs  and  Uluru  in  1972,  writ  ing  a  lengthy  account  of  his  journey  and  his  first  meetings  with  indigenous  Australians.   Raya  and  Mark  were  founding  members  of   the  Jewish  Holocaust  Centre  and  he  saw  it  as  his  duty  to  go  to  Victor  Smorgon  for  funding.  ""After  all,""  he  would  say,  ""I  worked  for  him  during  the  war.""  The  centre's  -new  wing  was  the  result.  Mark  translated  thousands  of  pages  of  Yiddish  and  Polish  into  English  for  the  cen  tre's  archives.  In  retirement  it  became  his  pas  sion,  especially  after  the  death  of  his  Raya  in  1995.  As  her  illness  progressed,  Mark  became  a  regular  at  Toorak  Shul  (Melbourne  Hebrew  Congregation),  saying  he  attended  because  the  singing  by  Cantor  David  Rubinfeld,  lifted  his   heart.   His  passing  was  in  keeping  with  his  life.  On  Friday  11  April,  Mark's  long  life  ended  peace  fully,  in  daughter-in-law  Asheley's  arms  as  she   read  stories  from  the  Tanach.   His  Yiddishkeit,  social  and  political  activism  are  irreplaceable.   David  Langsam  is  Mark  Langsam's  son. ",2003-05-09
"  Jewish*,  and  proud  of  it   TWO  proudly-identifying  high-achievers  have  been  in  the  news   —  Connecticut  US  Senator  Joe  Lieberman  and  Israeli  Colonel  Han  Ramon.   Lieberman,  in  entering  the  race  for  the  Democratic  nomination  for  the  US  presidency,  makes  a  virtue  of  his  Jewish  identity,  so  much  so  that  it  became  a  feature  of  his  quest  for  the  vice-presidency  in  2000.   An  Orthodox  Jew,  he  tailors  his  congressional  work  so  that  he  is  able  to  observe  Shabbat  and  the  festivals,  while  he  and  his  wife  Hadassah  -  the  daughter  of  Holocaust  survivors  —  have  highlighted  their  experiences  on  the  campaign  trail  in  a  newly-released  book.   Colonel  Ramon  —  a  member  of  the  NASA  team  which  blasted  into  space  last  week  —  while  not  observant,  requested  kosher  food  and  made  the  point  that  his  mother  was  interned  in  Auschwitz,  while  his  father  had  fought  for  the  establishment  of  the  State  of  Israel.   “I  was  born  in  Israel,  and  I’m  proof  for  my  parents  and  their  gen  eration  that  whatever  we’ve  been  fighting  for  in  the  last  century  is  coming  true,”  he  said.  “I  feel  I’m  representing  the  whole  Jewish  peo  ple.”   While  there  is  no  reason  why  people  such  as  Lieberman  and  Ramon  should  not  be  achieving,  it  is  always  encouraging  when  those  who  do  are  willing  and  proud  to  affirm  their  identity.

"  An  open  letter  from  a  Jew  in  jail   “Jail  is  a  place  where  a  heart  can  cry  for  the  love  of  families  and   friends  and  where,  at  night,  the  loneliness   creeps  into  your  heart  and  you  can  taste  the  salt  in  the  air  of  the  many  silent  tears.”   IT  must  surely  be  a  fate  God  has   bestowed  upon  me  to  let  me  live  this  wretched  life  of  inner  pain  and  sadness,  being  among  those  that  I  chose  as  my  friends  in  what  I  now  know  to  be  a  trade  of  despair  and  grief.   Since  I  have  been  in  jail  I  have  seen  examples  of  what  this  trade  can  and  has  done  to  many  once-hon  ourable,  caring  and  intelligent  men,  most  of  whom  are  now  mere  shells  filled  with  never-ending  sadness.   As  for  myself  -  well,  I  have  the  blessing  of  God  and  the  light  and  ful  filment  of  you  and  my  family,  which  keeps  burning  in  my  heart  so  that  I  can  distinguish  between  the  truth  and  how  evil  can  disguise  itself.  Only  through  my  experiences  can  I  help  save  many  people  from  the  same  fate   that  has  been  inflicted  on  me.   Jail  is  a  very  unforgiving  place  and  each  and  every  day  evil  surrounds  me  in  so  many  ways.  Only  those  who  have  the  strength  within  themselves  and  their  faiths  will  emerge  wiser.   Jail  is  also  a  place  of  need  in  today’s  society  -  a  place  where  twist  ed  souls,  broken  faiths  and  evil  towards  mankind  can  be  detained,   explored  and  sometimes  cured.   It  is  a  place  for  those  of  us  who  see  the  wrong  in  our  past  deeds  and  actions.  It  is  a  place  where  a  heart  can  cry  for  the  love  of  our  families  and  friends  and  where,  at  night,  the  lone  liness  creeps  into  your  heart  and  you  can  taste  the  salt  in  the  air  of  the  many  silent  tears.   These  experiences  that  I  go  through  each  day  are  a  lesson  for  me  to  spread  among  those  people  who  are  so  vulnerable,  like  I  was  myself  in  falling  for  the  temptations  and  easy  promises  of  happiness,  which  I  now  know  to  be  impossible.   About  90  per  cent  of  the  inmates  in  jail  are  people  that  are  lost  within  themselves  -  completely  shattered  people  who  have  lost  the  pathway  in  life  and  are  subsequently  striving  for  happiness,  but  don’t  understand  that  true  happiness  is  a  feeling  that  cannot   be  seen.   Today  I  took  a  very  long  look  around  myself  and  what  I  saw  was  a  world  moving  so  fast  and  so  errati  cally,  with  people  running  endlessly  looldng  for  an  excuse  for  being  here,  or  a  person  to  lend  an  ear  to  a  false  self-assuring  story.   The  young  people  in  here  make  my  heart  truly  bleed  and  never  would  I  want  you  to  feel  this  pain  and  suf   fering.  By  just  looking  into  their  eyes,  I  can  see  why  so  many  of  them  re   offend.   It  seems  that  they  have  a  need  to  feel  accepted,  loved  and  respected  and  for  their  true  selves.  They  are  search  ing  for  these  three  things  and  so  often  change  from  being  themselves,  through  peer-group  pressure.  Just  to  fit  in,  they  find  false  happiness  in  the  misfortunes,  sadness  and  pain  that  is  endured  by  their  fellow  humans.   So  consider  and  look  at  a  true   laugh  and  feel  the  honesty  in  it,  for  laughter  is  a  medicine  which  pro  duces  true  happiness,  as  it  feels  no  pain,  no  sadness  and  fills  the  body  with  a  special  feeling  that  reflects  warmth,  unlike  a  false  laugh  that  is  only  but  a  mere  noise  or  exhalation.   So  my  son,  I  have  decided  that  I  will  transform  the  wrong  that  I  have   done  to  help  those  from  following  in  my  footsteps,  for  this  is  what  my   heart  now  tells  me  to  do.   I  would  like  to  help  everyone  from  these  hidden  dangers  and  if  you  know  of  anyone  who  is  somewhat  lost  and  in  need  of  some  advice,  please  ask  them  to  write  to  me,  as  I  would  be  so  honoured  to  be  able  to   help  them  make  the  right  choices.   My  love  for  you,  my  dearest  son  and  my  family,  knows  no  bounds   and  I  cannot  describe  in  words  how   much  I  miss  the  warmth  of  being  at  home  with  my  beloved  ones.  Home,  not  jail,  is  life.   This  letter  was  written  by  a  father  in  his   40s  to  his  son.  He  has  been  in  Port   Phillip  Prison  for  almost  two  years.

"  Jewish  leader  blasts  Austrian  chancellor   FREDY  ROM   ZURICH  -  The  head  of  Austria’s  Jewish  community  is  accusing  the  country’s  chancellor  of  malice  toward  the  Jewish  community  over  a  funding  spat  for  community  security.   Chancellor  Wolfgang  Schuessel  gives  him  “the  feeling  that  his  goal  is  the  liquidation  of  the  community”,  a  Viennese  newspaper  quoted  Ariel  Muzicant  as  saying.   The  dispute  arose  after  Muzicant  warned  that  without  compensation  for  stolen  property  and  government  financial  help  the  community  might  go  bankrupt,  and  Austria’s  few  remaining  Jews  be  forced  to  emigrate.   “If  the  Austrian  Government  does  not  begin  to  pay  compensation  for  the  small  Jewish  community,  we  may  have  to  close  our  business  by  July  1,”  Muzicant  told  journalists  last  week  in  Vienna.   Schuessel’s  office  did  not   respond  to  requests  for  comment.  The  community  has  been  fighting  with  the  government  for  years  over  assets  that  were  stolen  or  destroyed  by  the  Nazis  during  World  War  II.  Vienna’s  Jewish  community,  which  numbered  about  170,000  in  1938,  was  among  the  richest  in   Europe  before  the  war.  Today  it   numbers  6710.   The  head  of  the  European  Jewish  Congress  backed  Muzicant’s  stance.  “It’s  not  because  of  mismanagement  that  the  Jewish  community  is  out  of  money;  it’s  because  their  assets  were  stolen,”  said  Michel  Friedman,  a  German  Jew  who  is  president  of  the  European  Jewish  Congress.   I  “It's  not  because  of   mismanagement  that  the  Jewish  community  is  out  of  money;  it’s   because  their  assets  were  stolen.”   MICHEL  FRIEDMAN  President,  European  Jewish  Congress   The  issue  is  “explosive”,  he  said,  especially  when  the  community  has  to  spend  more  than  20  per  cent  of  its  budget  on  security  -  which   Friedman  thinks  should  be  the  government’s  responsibility.   “You  cannot  blame  the  Jews  when  this  small  community  is  threatened  by  antisemitism,”  he   told  journalists.

"  THE  STATE  OF  JEWISH  EDUCATION  TODAY   By  Dr  Hilton  Immerman  CEO,  Hie  Shalom  Institute   During  the   last  50  years,  the  Jewish  people  have  been  affected  by  dramatic  historical  and  cultural  change.  Our  thinking,  programming  and  funding  of  Jewish  education,  however,  have  not  kept  pace.   We  have  moved  from  Judaism  by   descent,  to  Judaism  by  consent  According  to  Professor  Avi  Ravitzky,  the  Holocaust  was  the  embodiment  of  a  situation  in  which  a  given  identity  and  fate  were  forced  upon  all  Jews.  In  stark  contrast,  the  present  era  has  opened  almost  every  possible  option  for  the  Jew.   This  new  freedom  has  no  precedent  in  our  history.  Jews  may  range  from  a  Satmar  Hasid  in  New  York  and  a  liberal  Jew  in  Sydney  to  a  secular  Israeli  and  an  assimilated  Jew  in  Moscow.  This  underlines  the  crucial  role  of  Jewish  education  as  the  only  tool  to  ensure  that  we  remain  as  one  people  with  a  common   future.   But  the  state  and  status  of  Jewish  education  worldwide  are  not  altogether  healthy  and  positive.  If  the  main  goal  of  our  education  system  is  to  produce  committed  and  knowledgeable  Jews,  we  have  a  way  to  go.  Although  we  in  Sydney  may  be  doing  better  than  many  communities,  assimilation  abounds  and  very  few  of  us  are  Jewishly  learned.   IRADmONAL  JEWISH  EDUCATION   In  the  traditional  Jewish  world,  Jewish   education  began  for  the  infant  and  young   child,  in  the  most  effective  way,  as  family  and  experiential  education  -  which  is,  of  course,  prescribed  in  our  law  and  repeated  daily  in  the  Shema.  From  the  age  of  adolescence,  the  Beit  Midrash  came  next  for  the  male  of  the  species.  The  chevruta  approach,  in  which  learners  debated  with  each  other  and  grappled  with  understanding  and  interpreting  our  sacred  texts,  has  much  to  commend  it  as  an  educational  methodology.   But  let’s  not  romanticise  the  past  entirely.  Probably  few  learners  were  exposed  to  inspirational  teachers  and  encouraged  to  develop  a  genuinely  questioning  and  analytical  approach.  However,  Jewish  education  was  what  it  should  be  -  something  that  occurred  from  the  womb  to  the  tomb.   JEWISH  SCHOOL-AGE  EDUCATION   In  contradistinction,  the  average  Sydney  Jew   today  has  a  very  different  Jewish  education.   The  experience  of  Judaism  in  the  home  for  most  of  our  children  probably  includes  Shabbat  dinners,  a  Pesach  seder,  a  yomtov  meal  or  two,  distinctive  Jewish  food  (all  this  has  been  aptly  described  as  “gastronomic  Judaism”),  maybe  a  gift  for  Chanukah  and  attendance  at  a  few  shul   services  a  year.  Then  comes  Jewish  preschool  and  dayschool  education  for  63  per  cent  (according  to  demographer  Gary  Eckstein)  of  tiie  population,  with  some  of  the  balance  having  only  very  limited  exposure  to  formal  and  informal  Jewish  education,  through  the  good  work  of  Academy  BJE  and  the  Zionist  youth  movements.  Most  have  bar/bat  mitzvahs,  which  seldom  prove  a  meaningful  educational  experience  and  often  signal  a  graduation,  from  rather  than  serious  commencement  of  more  sophisticated  Jewish  learning.   In  recent  times,  there  have  been  advances  in  Jewish  Studies  curriculum  development  Some  of  the  focus  is  finally  shifting  beyond  questions  of  “what?”  and  “how  to?”  to  the  more  philosophical  exploration  of  “why?”   However,  according  to  Professor  Sylvia  Fishman  from  Brandeis  University,  Jewish  Studies  curricula  are  still  being  constructed  on  misguided  models  which  assume  the  active  support  of  traditional  Jewish  family  life.   There  has  also  been  progress  in  informal  Jewish  education,  but  unfortunately  security  concerns  have  limited  the  most  effective  and  important  programs  of  all,  the  Israel  trips  and  study  tours.  AUJS  succeeded  in  breaking  the  drought  last  summer  by  sending  over  200  students  on  various  Israel  programs.   EDUCATION  ISNT  CHUD’S  PLAY   However,  even  with  the  good  work  of  the   dayschools,  Academy  BJE  and  the  youth   movements,  the  paradigm  shift  that  we  need  is  the  existential  acceptance  of  the  age-old  truth  that  Jewish  learning  is  a  life-long  endeavour  and  should  not  be  any  less  thought-provoking  and  challenging  than  our  secular  education.  To  have  a  thriving  community,  we  must  develop  a  learning  community.   About  a  decade  ago,  Sam  Iipski  argued  convincingly  in  an  Australian  Jewish  News  editorial  that  Jewish  dayschools  and  boards  of  Jewish  education  might  lay  the  essential  foundations  of  our  future  but  are  not  a  panacea  to  the  community’s  problems.  Unless  we  complete  the  structure,  first  by  building  secure  walls  and  then  a  roof,  our  huge  investment  may  be  largely  wasted.   The  walls  must  be  constructed  on  the  university  campuses  by  the  work  of  Hillel  and  AUJS  and  Jewish  higher/tertiary  courses  that  are  accessed  by  too  few  students.  Ongoing  quality  adult  education  like  The  Shalom  Institute,  Melton  and  Mosaic  Programs  complete  the  structure  to  ensure  a  Jewishly   literate  community.   Jewish  communities  today  do  not  invest  sufficiently  in  their  adults.  We  need  Jewishly  educated  and  committed  adults  for  leadership,  activism,  role  modelling,  funding,  nurturing  their  children’s  identity  -  and  for  their  own  participation  and  affiliation.   The  more  our  children  see  adults  taking  Jewish  education  seriously,  the  more  they’ll  respect  it  and  stop  regarding  it  as  something  unsophisticated  that’s  fit  only  for  kids.   INVEST  IN  OUR   inielleciual  FUTURE   News  Corporation  chairman  Rupert   Murdoch  recently  stated  that  the   government  has  already  invested  significantly  in  school  education.  Itfs  now  time  for  this  to  be  migrated  upward  to  improve  institutions  of  higher  learning.  Without  urgent  support  for  our  centres  of  learning,  he  continued,  Australia  is  at  risk  of  becoming  something  worse  than  globally  disadvantaged:  we  are  threatened  with  global  irrelevance.   The  notion  that  our  secular  education  should  cease  at  18  is  seen  as  patently  absurd,  yet  this  is  how  many  of  our  community  leaders  act  in  relation  to  the  Jewish  education  of  our  community  and  even  our  own  children.   University  age  is  a  period  of  increased  independence  and  freedom  from  family  and  tradition  -  and  a  critical  time  for  the  Jewish  community.  When  our  dayschool  graduates  arrive  on  campus,  the  variety  and  novelty  of  the  world  outside,  is  particularly  seductive,  and  we  must  offer  sophisticated  and  effective  educational  programs  both  formal  and  informal  -  to  give  them  good  reason  to  remain  affiliated.  This  must  then  be  followed  by  a  plethora  of  opportunities  for  intellectually  stimulating  adult  and  continuing  education.   QUESTTO  CONNECT   Not  only  will  a  greater  commitment  to  life   long  Jewish  learning  make  our  community   a  dynamic  one,  but  it  will  help  to  satisfy  our  most  fundamental  quest:  to  seek  greater  meaning  and  fulfilment  in  life  and  to  connect  to  our  people  and  to  our  deeply  profound  heritage.  Sophisticated,  challenging  and  philosophical  Jewish  education  for  adults  Ms  into  this  category  and  constitutes  a  catalyst  in  our  voyage  of  discovery.   1 ",2003-05-16
"  Getting  serious  about  Jewish  humour   VIEWPOINT   RUTH  WISSE   A  new  American  book  says  that  at  least  one   Jewish  sitcom  premiered  each  year  between   1989  and  2002,  and  that  by  1999  a  dozen  Jewish  sitcoms  were   airing  weekly  on  network  and  cable  television  in  the  US.   ERE’S  a  joke  that  recently  won  a  laugh  from  my  col  leagues.  Four  Europeans  go  hiking  together,  and  get   frightfully  lost  First  they  run  out  of  food,  then  they  run  out  of  water.   “I’m  so  thirsty,”  says  the  English   man.  “I  must  have  tea.”   “I’m  so  thirsty,  says  the  Frenchman.   “I  must  have  wine.”   “I’m  so  thirsty,”  says  the  German.  “I   must  have  beer.”   “I’m  so  thirsty,”  says  the  Jew.  “I  must   have  diabetes!”   Although  this  joke  got  a  laugh  from  my  Jewish  colleagues,  the  non-Jewish  secretary  who  was  also  present  was  not  amused.  In  feet,  she  told  me  that  she  found  the  joke  antisemitic.  Could  I  please  explain  to  her  why  it  was  funny,   since  it  seemed  to  make  fun  of  the   Jews?  And  could  I  also  explain  why  we  were  all  so  much  in  the  habit  of  joking?   So,  how  can  you  explain  the  humour  of  a  joke  to  someone  who  doesn’t  find  it  funny?  Was  this  joke  antisemitic?  Because  the  Jew  is  revealed  as  a  hypochondriac?  We  Jews  laughed  because  we  recognised  that  the  Jew’s  anxiety  is  different  from  that  of  his  gen  tile  companions.   Many  times  my  colleagues  and  I  have  stood  discussing  a  recent  bomb  ing  in  Israel  The  anxiety  was  organised  in  a  compressed  form  that  gave  us  aes  thetic  satisfaction  and  allowed  us  the   release  of  laughter.  The  secretary  does  not  share  the  anxiety  of  the  Jew,  and  she  resents  that  there  should  be  any  thing  that  sets  us  collectively  apart  from  our  companions.   By  drawing  attention  to  special  problems,  Jewish  joking  is  disquieting   on  two  counts:  because  it  reminds  us  of  these  problems,  and  because  it  seems  to  reinforce  our  peculiarity.   If  joking  is  a  form  of  alleviating  ten  sion,  and  if  tension  runs  high  among  the  Jews,  then  one  can  see  how  joking  might  become  a  Jewish  sport  Far  from  being  antisemitic,  the  joke  I  offered  my  colleagues  was  a  form  of  entertainment   that  is  highly  valued  in  our  culture.   In  the  real  world,  we  can’t  control  the  threat  to  the  Jews.  Joking  is  a  mar  vellous  way  of  exploding  the  tension  we  can’t  otherwise  control  Perhaps  this  helps  to  explain  why  by  the  mid-1970s  it  was  estimated  that  80  per  cent  of  the  comedians  in  America  were  Jewish.   It  is  certainly  true  that  some  of  the  best  Jewish  humour  is  directed  by  Jews  against  themselves,  with  a  backhanded  kind  of  aggression  that  condemns  and  congratulates  us  at  the  same  time.   The  relation  of  laughter  and  trem  bling  that  Saul  Bellow  finds  to  be  char  acteristically  Jewish  is  often  embodied  in  the  Jewish  comic  character  known  as  the  schlemiel  The  schlemiel  is  an  eth  nically  Jewish  version  of  the  fool,  caught  up  in  situations  that  reflect  the  historical  problems  of  the  Jewish  peo  ple.  We  are  meant  to  see  that  this  man  is  daft  by  ordinary  standards,  but  by  his  own  standards  he  is  altogether  sane.   The  following  joke  dating  from  World  War  I  may  help  to  convey  why  his  humour  remains  so  haunting.   An  ordinary  Jew  is  stranded  in  no  man’s  land  sometime  during  the  war.  Suddenly  he  finds  himself  staring  into  the  beam  of  a  German  sentry’s  search  light  “Halt”  shouts  the  guard  “Halt  or   I’ll  shoot”   “Are  you  crazy,”  says  the  Jew.  “Can’t  you  see  that  I  am  a  human  being?”   The  Jew  in  the  joke  fails  to  under  stand  the  ways  of  the  world  He  isn’t  an  ideological  pacifist  he  just  doesn’t  get  the  point  of  aggression  and  belligerence.   What  sounds  like  foolishness  on  his  part  points  up  the  greater  foolishness  on  the  part  of  the  armed  sentries.  He  is  making  the  marvellous  point  that  a  human  being  is  so  precious  it  would  be  sheer  idiocy  to  shoot  him  simply  because  he  happens  to  be  strolling  on  the  wrong  side  of  the  road  The  joke   invites  us  to  see  that  in  an  insane  socie  ty,  the  Jew-whom  it  casts  in  the  role  of  the  schlemiel  -  may  be  the  sanest  per   son  around.   Perhaps  the  most  memorable  of  all  schlemiel  stories  is  Isaac  Bashevis  Singer’s  Gimpel  The  Fool,  written  in  1944,  and  translated  into  English  by  Saul  Bellow  a  dozen  years  later.   On  one  level,  this  story  invites  us  to  imagine  that  we  are  back  in  Sholem  Aleichem’s  territory,  in  a  small  fictional  town  in  Eastern  Europe.  But  with  Gim  pel  telling  his  own  story,  we  actually  have  a  very  complicated,  modem  dou  ble  consciousness.  In  effect,  because  Gimpel  does  not  see  himself  as  others  see  him,  he  challenges  our  normal  assumptions  about  justice  and  truth.  Singer  radicalises  the  schlemiel  by  showing  how  far  he  is  prepared  to  go  in  protecting  his  innocence.   Singer  and  Woody  Allen  use  the  schlemiel  in  almost  diametrically  opposite  ways  -  Singer  to  call  into  question  the  self-sufficiency  of  man  and  Woody  Allen  to  call  into  question  the  trust  in  idealism  or  in  God.  Singer  imbues  a  strictly  comic  form  with  trag  ic  undertones;  Allen  turns  the  tragedies  and  epics  into  comedy.   A  new  American  book  says  that  at  least  one  Jewish  sitcom  premiered  each  year  between  1989  and  2002,  and  that  by  1999  a  dozen  Jewish  sitcoms  were  airing  weekly  on  network  and  cable  tel   evision  in  the  US.   This  manner  of  coping  famously  associated  with  the  Jews  has  become  a  form  of  entertainment  This  is  certain   ly  to  the  good.  Returning  to  our  secre  tary,  I  wish  that  she  could  have  joined  in  our  laughter,  and  I  hope  that  over  the  years,  she  may  begin  telling  jokes   about  the  office.   But  she  is  also  right  to  be  concerned  when  joking  becomes  too  much  of  a  habit  The  case  of  the  Jews  may  indicate  that  joking  is  not  always  the  most  appropriate  response  to  problems,  and  may  itself  become  a  problem  when  it  absorbs  more  psychic  energy  than  it  discharges.   One  could  conclude  with  this:  humour  served  the  Jews  as  a  marvel  lous  means  of  dealing  with  their  increasing  levels  of  anxiety.  But  as  Jew  ish  humour  recognised  that  it  could  not  alleviate  the  sources  of  that  anxiety,  it  issued  warnings  from  within  itself  that  other  better  solutions  would  have  to  be  found.

"  US  policy  and  Jewish  conspiracies   HAVING  identified  a  “group”  of  American  Jews  connected  to  the  Likud  Party,  Jonathan  Holmes  (AJN11/4/03)  states  that  in  his  ABC  Four  Comers  program,  the  relation  ship  between  this  group  and  the  right  wing  of  Israeli  politics  was  of  “possible  relevance”  to  US  adminis  tration  policy  towards  Iraq.   Possible  relevance!  Come  Mr   Holmes,  why  so  coy  with  the  AJN?  The  central  premise  of  your  Ameri  can  Dreamers  was  that  this  radical,  Israel-connected,  Jewish  cabal  has  finally  succeeded  in  making  its  Iraq  policy  that  of  the  US  administration.   Precisely  the  same  view  was  later  expressed  by  Syria’s  Deputy  Ambas  sador  to  the  US,  but  he  went  an  explicit  step  further:  Israel  has  covert  ly,  working  through  Diaspora  Jewry,  determined  US  policy  on  Iraq.   It  is  a  step  that  Mr  Holmes  mere  ly  permits  his  audience  to  infer  from  the  totality  of  American  Dreamers.   Mr  Holmes  invited  the  AJN  readership  to  peruse  an  exchange  of  his  on  the  Crikey  website.  What  comes  out  is:  a  sneering  reference  to  “good  ol’  democratic  Israel”;  his  belief  that  a  “US-Israeli  hegemony”  exists  in  the  Middle  East  and  that  the  Iraq  policy  is  “furthering”  that  hegemony;  and  that  he  believes  his  premise  is  an  open  secret  in  the  US  media,  but  is  kept  quiet  because  US   journalists  have  “a  mortal  fear  of  being  labelled  antisemitic”,  some  thing  Mr  Holmes’  believes  happens  with  “depressing  frequency”.   Accordingly,  Mr  Holmes  con  cludes  his  A/N  letter  with  a  warning  that  “accusations  of  antisemitism  are  too  often  hurled  around”.   As  if  an  Israel-obsessed  media  has  played  no  small  part  in  generating  anti-Jewish  feeling,  but  is  a  red  her  ring  invoked  by  Jews  for  the  purpose  of  suppressing  criticism  of  Israel.   SIMON  BROCKWELL   Bronte,  NSW   DISINGENUOUS   JONATHAN  Holmes’  response  to  the  article  on  American  Dreamers   was  disingenuous  (AJN11/4/03).   A  program  on  neo-cons  would  have  considered  Rumsfeld,  Chaney  and  Rice.  A  program  on  Jewish   views  would  have  included  liberals.   The  message  of  American  Dreamers  was  that  Jewish  advisers  were  manipulating  the  wielders  of  power  to  the  disadvantage  of  the  US.   Holmes’  chutzpadilc  conclusion  that  “accusations  of  antisemitism  are  too  often  hurled  around”  is  an   attempt  to  intimidate  us  into  silence.

"  Bloomsday  orators  grapple  with  Jewish  identity   JACQUI  GAL   “THE  story  starts,  as  it  should,  with  food  and  sex,”  said  Mary  Kostakidis  as  she  addressed  the  crowd  at  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum.

On  June  16,  some  150  Ulysses  enthusiasts  crowded  into  the  museum   to  mark  the  day  Joyce’s  famous  Leopold  Bloom  spent  in  the  streets  of   Dublin.   The  final  event  in  a  long  list  of  cel  ebrations,  the  function  comprised  a  mix  of  readings,  interpretation  and  a  kosher  Triestine  supper.   Rabbi  Ariel  Haddad,  a  Trieste  resi  dent  and  director  of  the  local  Jewish  museum,  provided  insights  into  com  munal  life  in  the  city  where  Joyce  began  work  on  his  epic  novel  and  met  his  friend  Ettore  Schmitz—the  inspi   ration  for  the  Bloom  character.   Stepping  up  to  the  podium,  clutch  ing  an  armload  of  paperbacks  he  joked  “people  of  the  book!”   Speaking  in  a  melange  of  Yiddish  and  Italian  accents,  face  fringed  with  a  thick,  wiry  beard,  he  used  the  books  to  provide  references  and  quotations.

Photo:  Ingrid  Shakenovsky   “When  Joyce  came  to  Trieste,  he  found  a  town  that  was  multicultural,  intercultural  and  cross-cultural,”  he  said.   This  might  explain  why  Joyce  found  it  natural  to  foster  a  friendship  with  a  Jew  and  write  about  him  in  a  positive  light.   “Joyce  treated  Judaism  as  a  civilisa  tion,”  Rabbi  Haddad  said.   “He  knew  not  to  treat  Leopold  Bloom  as  a  character  who  may  be  this  way  or  that  way.  He  was  one  of  the  few  writers  who  writes  fondly  of  his  Jew  ish  characters,  and  as  a  Jewish  com  munity  we  must  acknowledge  this.”   Much  of  Rabbi  Haddad’s  treatise  reflected  on  Jewish  identity,  character  ising  it  as  “an  issue  that  is  controversial  and  somehow  uncomfortable,  even  for  me”.   The  adoption  of  the  secular  pen  name  Italo  Svevo  by  Joyce’s  muse,  Ettore  Schmitz,  was  a  subject  of  great  interest  to  Rabbi  Haddad.   “What  was  more  important  to  Ettore  Shmitz?”  he  wondered,  “to  be  Schmitz  or  Italo  Svevo?”   The  Jewish  identity  or  the  literary   one?   Speaking  about  the  difficulty  of  solving  questions  relating  to  identity,   he  continued:  “After  emancipation  there  was  a  rush,  like  a  100  metre  dash,  to  see  who  will  be  first  to  get  rid  of  his  Jewish  identity.   “It  was  a  mistake,  it  was  not  a  mis  take,  we  cannot  know.  What’s  impor  tant  is  what  that  produced.  It  produced  Italo  Svevo.   “When  he  took  that  nom  de   plume,  he  introduced  a  self-conflict.  Maybe  he  wanted  to  get  rid,  a  bit,  of  his  Jewish  particularity,  specificity.   “It  produced  Leopold  Bloom.  He’s  a  direct  result  of  the  process  of  aggre  gation,  acculturation  and  assimila   tion.   The  question  who  is  Leopold  Bloom  is  the  $1  billion  question.  It  is  the  question  of  who  is  a  Jew?”   While  it’s  certain  that  posing  unan  swerable  questions  is  a  classic  Jewish  trait,  not  all  first-time  readers  of  Ulysses  detect  Bloom’s  Jewishness.   “When  I  first  read  Ulysses,  Bloom  didn’t  strike  me  as  a  Jew,”  said  univer  sity  lecturer  and  Heat  editor  Dr  Ivor  Indyk.   “When  I  re-read  it  in  preparation  for  tonight,  I  couldn’t  help  but  hear  the  old  Eastern  European  voices  of  parents  in  my  head  saying  ‘what  kind  of  Jew  is  this?’   “Bloom’s  father  converted  to  Protestantism.  Bloom  himself  con  verted  to  Catholicism.  He’s  not  cir  cumcised  and  he’s  treif.”   Other  speakers  included  Father  Ed  Campion,  radio  presenter  Andrea  Stretton,  Professor  Ron  Penny  and  Justice  Marcus  Einfeld.   James  Joyce  Foundation  artistic  director  Clara  Mason  erupted  into  giggles  as  she  read  her  assigned  extract,  set  in  Barney  Kiernan’s  Pub.  She  admitted  to  have  arrived  directly  from  PJ  O’Brien’s  Pub,  where  a  group   had  dramatised  the  same  scene.  The   temperature  in  the  room  rose  two  degrees  as  the  audience,  who  could  not  help  but  join  the  laughter,  watched  Mason  struggle  to  speak.   The  readings  complete,  the  crowd  poured  into  an  adjoining  room  where  they  tasted  Triestine-inspired  mine  strone  soup  and  salmon  bagels. ",2003-06-20

"  Jewish  approach  was  proper  -  Carr   VICALHADEFF   NO  “bullying”  took  place  to  attempt  to  dissuade  him  from  presenting  the  Sydney  Peace  Prize,  Premier  Bob  Carr   asserted  last  week.   He  was  responding  to  a  question  from  ABC’s  AM  presenter  Linda  Mottram,  who  inquired  whether  “bullying”  had  occurred.  “Not  as  far  as  I’m  concerned,”  Carr  replied.   “There  have  been  representations  from  people  in  the  Jewish  communi  ty,  just  about  all  of  them  friends  of  mine,  people  I  have  demonstrated  with  outside  the  Soviet  Embassy  on  the  issue  of  Soviet  Jewry  or  who’ve  met  with  me  visiting  Israelis.   “Their  representations  have  been  proper,  civil,  appropriate,  but  I  dis  agree  with  them  because  ...  it’s  only  through  engagement  with  the  other  side  that  the  security  of  Israel  will  finally  be  guaranteed.”   Discounting  the  suggestion  that  he  was  giving  the  prize  “more  status  than  it  would  have”,  he  said  it  was  important  to  present  it  “for  this  reason  -  since  1977,  when  I  set  up  NSW  Labor  Friends  of  Israel,  I  would  have  attend  ed  countless  meetings  with  visiting  Israelis,  I’ve  met  two  former  prime  ministers  of  Israel,  one  of  them  twice,  I’ve  met  numerous  Israelis  and  been  very  prominent  working  with  the  Jew  ish  community  in  Sydney”.   But  “I’ve  met  very  few  Palestinians.   Unless  we  talk  to  both  sides-this  con  flict  has  been  described  as  a  dash  of  two  just  causes  -  we’ll  never  break  through  and  lead  both  sides  to  the  set  tlement  that  will  mean  no  bombings,   secure  boundaries  for  Israel  and  a  state   for  the  dispossessed  Palestinians”.   “I  didn’t  award  the  prize.  I  simply   Premier  Bob  Carr...  “Their  representations  have  been  proper,  civil,  appropriate.”   seize  the  opportunity  to  engage  with  a   serious  Palestinian  leader  out  of  a   profound  view  that  we’ll  only  get  peace  by  that  sort  of  exchange.”   Responding  to  the  suggestion  by  Foreign  Minister  Alexander  Downer  that  former  Palestinian  prime  minis  ter  Abu  Mazen  would  be  a  more   appropriate  winner,  Carr  said  that  “according  to  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  website,  he  was  a  Holocaust  denier;  he  argued  in  a  thesis  that  there  weren’t  six  million  Jews  killed  during  the  Second  World  War,  that  the  number  is  only  a  few  hundred  thousand”   “As  far  as  I  know,  he  has  never  repudiated  that  thesis,  and  that  makes  this  point  to  me:  there  are  no  heroes  in  the  Middle  East,  any  more  than  there  are  in  Northern  Ireland.   “We’ve  got  to  work  with  the  peo  ple  of  both  sides,  and  if  they  want  to  talk  peace,  a  two-state  solution,  we  ought  to  engage  with  them  and  make   whatever  difference  we  can.”   Speaking  on  the  Sunday”  program,  Carr  agreed  it  may  have  been  “naive”  to  accept  the  invitation  to  present  the  award,  but  reiterated  that  it  was  essen  tial  to  engage  with  Palestinians.”   Despite  persistent  questioning  from  Helen  Dailey,  particularly  in  relation  to  communal  heavyweight  Frank  Lowy,  Carr  refuted  the  sugges  tion  that  he  had  been  inappropriately  lobbied  not  to  present  the  prize.   “Frank  Lowy  asked  me  why  I  was  presenting  the  prize,  but  it  was  an  absolutely  courteous  call,”  he  said.  “It  was  not  a  request  for  me  not  to  do  it”  The  discussions  “were  unfailingly  polite  and  courteous”.

"  Jewish,  Islamic  Studies  split  up   DIONNE  MOSKOW   JEWISH  Studies  and  Islamic  Studies  have  split  up  at  the  University  of  Sydney.   The  Department  of  Semitic  Studies  is  no  longer,  but  has  been  re  formed  into  the  Department  of  Hebrew,  Biblical  and  Jewish  Studies  and  the  Department  of  Arabic  and   Islamic  Studies.   Both  are  part  of  the  School  of  European,  Asia  and  Middle  Eastern  Languages  and  Studies.   “The  concept  of  Semitic  Studies  is  outdated,”  said  Dr  Suzanne  Rut  land,  who  chairs  the  Department  of  Hebrew,  Biblical  and  Jewish  Studies.   “It  has  racial  connotations  that  Jews  and  Arabs  have  common  racial  backgrounds,  which  is  a  fallacy.   “There  are  commonalities  in  lan   guage  and  culture,  but  there  are  also  significant  differences.   “Academically,  the  split  makes   more  sense  because  we  can  focus  on   our  academic  speciality,”  Dr  Rutland   added.   Her  department  offers  full  majors  in  five  subject  areas  -  Classi  cal  Hebrew,  Modern  Hebrew,  Bibli  cal  Studies,  Thought  and  Culture.   “I  am  proud  of  the  fact  that  we  are  the  only  university  in  Australia   Joint  Committee  for  Jewish  Higher  Education  president  Peter  Wertheim,  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Steven  Rothman,  Moriah  College  vice   president  Mark  Schneider  and  Dr  Suzanne  Rutland  at  a  ceremony  to  mark  the  inauguration  of  the  Department  of  Hebrew,  Biblical  and  Jewish  Studies.   which  offers  a  full  major  and  an  Honours  program  in  Classical  Hebrew,  as  well  as  offering  Arama  ic,  Syriac,  Akkadian  and  even  Ugaritic,”  she  said.   “Our  Modern  Hebrew  program  has  been  updated,  and  we  are  work  ing  closely  with  top  Israeli  centres  specialising  in  teaching  Hebrew  as  a  foreign  language  at  the  Hebrew  University  of  Jerusalem  and  Tel  Aviv  University.”   The  previous  department  had  a   strong  postgraduate  program,  and  the  new  department  will  follow  suit,  Dr  Rutland  said.   “We  have  the  largest  number  of  graduate  students  in  our  School  of  Languages  and  Studies.   “We  introduced  a  Master’s  in   Holocaust  Studies  two  years  ago   and  are  one  of  the  few  universities  in  the  world  to  offer  it.   “We  also  extended  our  MA  in  Hebrew  and  Judaic  Studies  to  include  the  modem  period.” ",2003-04-11
"  Leaders  condemn  anti-Jewish  incidents   ALLONLEE   EXECUTIVE  Council  of  Australian   Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  has  welcomed  responses  to  a  letter  he  sent  out  last  week,  calling  for  Australia’s  leadership  to  condemn  attacks  on  Jews  during  the  course  of  the  debate  on  Iraq.   Releasing  figures  showing  a   record  number  of  antisemitic  attacks  in  March,  he  said:  “We  have  received  a  large  number  of  expressions  of  support  from  political  and  religious  leaders.  An  important  part  of  the  response  is  the  condemnation  of  the   motivation  and  rationalisation  of  antisemitic  acts.   “We  welcome  the  expressions  of  support  we’ve  received,  particularly  the  broad  recognition  that  attacks  on  Jews  are  in  effect  attacks  on  Australia’s  way  of  life.   “The  number  of  antisemitic  inci   dents  reported  in  March  were  the  highest  ever  for  that  month  -  48.  The  previous  highest  figure  for  March  was  39,  in  1998.”   Jones  noted  that  Citizenship  and   Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  Gary  Hargraves  and  Immigration  and  Aboriginal  affairs  Philip  Ruddock   had  called  to  condemn  the  attacks  on  the  Jewish  community.   He  also  pointed  to  Federal  Liberal  MP  Peter  King’s  speech  in  parlia  ment,  deploring  the  “the  attacks  upon  members  of  the  Jewish  com  munity  [which]  follow  comments  ...  which  suggest  that  American  foreign  policy  is  controlled  or  directed  by  the  interests  of  Israel”  (seepage  4).   “We  welcome  the   expressions  of  support   I  we've  received.”   JEREMY  JONES  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry   Shadow  Minister  for  Citizenship  and  Multicultural  Affairs  Federal  Labor  MP  Laurie  Ferguson  wrote  to  Jones  declaring:  “issues  such  as  the  Israeli-Palestinian  and  Iraqi  conflicts  are  controversial  ...  the  strongest  held  views  are,  however,  no  excuse  for  the  vilification  and  harassment  of   the  Jewish  community”.   Australian  Democrats  Senator   Natasha  Stott-Despoja  also  wrote  to  the  ECAJ:  “The  Australian  Democrats  condemn  all  violence,  harassment  and  public  expression  which  incites  hatred  on  the  basis  of  race,  religion,  sex,  colour  or  creed.”   Bishop  Michael  Putney  of  the  Australian  Catholic  Bishops  Conference  deplored  the  antisemitic  rhetoric  and  the  targeting  of  Jewish  people  and  buildings.   The  Religious  Society  of  Friends  (Quakers)  also  expressed  support,  and  Jones  said  he  had  been  informed  that  his  letter  has  been  distributed  by  the  National  Council  of  Churches.   “At  a  dinner  in  Canberra  attend  ed  by  ethnic  and  political  leaders,   Australian  Federation  of  Islamic   Councils  president  Amjad   Mehboobn  read  from  the  letter  and   expressed  his  organisation’s  opposi   tion  to  the  attacks.”   Jones  noted  that  the  letter  had  also  been  quoted  in  newspapers  such  as  the  Hindustan  Times  of  India  and  the  Washington  Times.

"  US  editor  of  Jewish  weeklies   l   TOMTUGEND   HERB  Brin,  one  of  the  most  colourful  writers  and  editors  in  the  annals  of  Los  Angeles  Jewish  journalism,  died  of  congestive  head   failure.   His  death  at  an  old-age  home  in  the  Los  Angeles  area  came  11  days  before  his  88th  birthday.  He  died  shortly  after  he  completed  his  autobiography,  pecked  out,  like  the  count  less  exposes,  features  and  editorials  he  wrote,  with  two  fingers  on  a  manual  typewriter.   For  some  45  years,  from  the  mid-1950s  tc  the  end  of  the  century,  Brin  was  the  editor  publisher  of  the  Heritage  Jewish  weeklies  in  Los  Angeles  and  the  surrounding  area.  He  also  authored  six  books  of  poetry  and  two  books  on  post-Holocaust  Germany.   Brin  battled  enemies,  or‘even  lukewarm  supporters,  of  Israel  and  the  Jewish  people  with  every  fibre  of  his  being  and  applied  the  same  passion,  and  often  blunt  language,  to  a  long  list  of  causes,  from  civil  rights  to  conser   vation.   His  overriding  passion  was  Israel,  which  he  visited  countless  times,  and  in  whose  capital  he  was  buried.   Brin  was  born  in  Chicago  of  immigrant  parents.  After  World  War  II  army  service,  he  moved  to  Los  Angeles  and  found  a  niche  as  a  lively  feature  writer  of  oddball  human  interest  stories  at  the  Los  Angeles  Times.   In  1954,  with  a  wife  and  three  small  sons,  Brin  quit  the  Times,  mortgaged  his  home,  and  started  the  Los  Angeles  Heritage  as  a  12-page  weekly.   He  continued  to  write  occasionally  for  his  old  paper  and  covered  the  Eichmann  trial  in  Jerusalem  for  the  LA  Times.   Throughout  the  years,  Heritage  published   HERB  BRIN   1915-2003   his  investigations  of  white  supremacy  and  neo-Nazi  organizations,  his  early  meetings  with  Soviet  Jews  and  his  picketing  of  the  1979  Oscar  ceremonies  to  protest  an  award  to  British  actress  Vanessa  Redgrave,  a  PLO  sympathizer.   Among  many  accolades,  Brin  especially  cherished  the  words  of  his  friend  Elie  Wiesel,  who  wrote,  ""How  a  journalist,  how  an  editor,  could  also  be  a  brilliant  poet  is  a  source  of  astonishment  -  and  gratitude.""   Brin  was  married  and  divorced  three  times.  He  is  survived  by  his  sons,  Stan,  a  business  reporter;  David,  an  author;  Daniel,  an  editor;  and  six  grandchildren. ",2003-03-21
"  Jewish  radio  cuts  shock  community   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   SBS  Radio  has  shocked  Jewish  leaders  with  a  decision  to  cut  programs  for  Jewish  audiences  by  one-third  from  July  1,  from  six  hours  a  week  to  four.   The  decision  -  which  eliminates   the  English-language  component  of  Jewish  programs  -  is  based  on  Census  figures,  which  community  leaders  say  do  not  reflect  the  size  and  composi  tion  of  the  Jewish  community,  which  is  estimated  at  110,000.   Executive  Council  of  Australian   Jewry  acting  president  Stephen  Roth  man  and  deputy  president  Diane  Shteinman  said  the  ECAJ  would  raise  the  matter  with  SBS.   “We  are  outraged,”  Shteinman  said.  “It’s  a  destructive  and  discrimi  natory  action.”   Rothman:  “We  will  be  asking  the  government  to  support  the  commu  nity  on  this  issue.”   They  will  seek  reinstatement  of  the  two  hours  of  Yiddish  and  Hebrew   programs  broadcast  on  Fridays  and  the  English-language  segments  on  Fridays  and  Sundays,  which  have   been  cut.   SBS  Radio  head  Quang  Luu  said  the  SBS  board  decided  to  cut  Jewish  program  time  after  the  2001  Census  reflected  only  5946  Hebrew-speakers  and  2667  Yiddish-speakers  in  Aus   tralia.   SBS  is  also  dropping  Irish,  Scot  tish,  Welsh  and  Belorussian  programs  to  make  time  for  the  emerging  Malaysian,  Somali,  Nepalese  and   Amharic  communities.   The  decision  to  cut  the  Yiddish  and  Hebrew  programs,  broadcast  from  2-4pm  on  Fridays,  leaves  four   hours  of  air  time  -  2-4pm  on  Wednesdays  and  11am-lpm  on  Sun  days  for  programs  in  Yiddish  and   Hebrew.   Luu  said  this  was  appropriate,  compared  with  allocations  to  larger  language  groups,  including  Indone  sian  (38,721  speakers),  Hungarian  (28,484),  Thai  (17,344)  and  Tongan  (10,500),  who  had  between  two  and  three  hours  each.   The  SBS  website  says  programs  are  based  on  language,  not  ethnicity.   But  Jewish  leaders  argue  that  the  Yiddish  and  Hebrew  programs  are  an  important  source  of  news  and  culture  for  the  entire  Jewish  community,  par  ticularly  as  they  include  an  English   segment  -  which  is  to  be  dropped.   Jewish  broadcasters  point  to  pro  posed  one-hour  increases  in  already   SBS  senior  journalist,  broadcaster  and  head  of  Hebrew  Nitza  Lowenstein.   If  the  network  is  to  remain  true  to  its  charter,  it  must  amend  the  pro  posed  change  so  that  it  continues  to  reflect  Australia’s  multicultural  society  -  the  Jewish  component   included.   OmOOK  14-EDITORIAL   substantial  timeslots  allocated  to  Ara   bic  (currently  14  hours  in  Sydney  and  nine  in  Melbourne),  Cantonese  (eight  hours  in  Sydney  and  Melbourne)  and   “We  will  be  asking  the  government  to  give  the  community  support  on  this  issue.""   STEPHEN  ROTHMAN   Acting  president  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry   Mandarin  (six  hours  in  Sydney  and  Melbourne).   However,  Census  figures  show  that  Chinese  languages  are  the  foreign  lan  guages  most  commonly  spoken  at  home  in  NSW,  Victoria,  ACT  and  Western  Australia  (with  Arabic  sec  ond  in  NSW).   Groups  whose  air  time  will  be  reduced  by  an  hour  are  Maltese  (cur  rently  nine  hours  in  Melbourne,  six  in  Sydney),  Portuguese  (five  hours)  and  Turkish  (eight  hours  in  Melbourne,  seven  in  Sydney).   “The  biggest  impact  is  on  us,”  said  a  Jewish  community  member  who  declined  to  be  identified.  “No-one   else  has  lost  so  much  air  time.  We   have  special  needs,  especially  taking   into  account  the  Middle  East  crisis  and  the  rise  of  antisemitism.   “SBS  has  been  broadcasting  to  the  Jewish  community  since  1975.  Now  they  are  trying  to  keep  us  out.  If  we  don’t  protest  now,  they’ll  cut  us  back   even  further.”   Warning  of  the  changes  came  last  year  when  SBS  told  a  meeting  of  eth   nic  leaders  that  it  intended  to  use  the  Census  to  review  its  programs.   Rothman  said  Jewish  delegates  explained  that  the  Census  did  not  reflect  the  number  of  Jews  in  Aus  tralia  because  members  of  the  com  munity,  particularly  Holocaust  survivors,  were  reluctant  to  reveal  their  religion.   It  was  “galling”  that  SBS  did  not  consult  the  community  before  decid  ing  to  cut  programs,  he  added.   Citizenship  and  Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  Gary  Hardgrave,  who  spoke  to  SBS  as  soon  as  he  was  informed  of  the  cut  to  Jewish  pro  grams,  did  not  offer  much  hope  that  the  government  would  be  able  to   influence  it.   “SBS  say  they  make  their  decisions  based  on  their  charter,  which  requires  their  programs  to  reflect  Australian  society.  They  say  the  Jewish  programs  are  at  a  higher  level  than  their  per  centage  of  society.   “But  they  should  not  make  deci  sions  without  consulting.  They  need  to  have  given  the  community  better   treatment.” ",2003-05-23

"  Life  of  a  Jewish  colonial  bushranger   An  Organised  Banditti:  The  story  behind  the  ‘Jewboy’  bushranger  gang   Colin  Roope  and  Patricia  Gregson  Published  by  Roope  and  Gregson,  2002,  232  pages,  $25   Reviewed  by  Rabbi  John  Levi   IF  you  are  intrigued  by  Jewish  bushrangers  this  is  the  perfect  book  for  you!   This  is  the  complete  story  of  a  gang  of  bold  desperadoes  in  colonial  New  South  Wales  who  engendered  both  terror  and  grudging  admiration  among  the  hapless  inhabitants  of  the  Lower  Hunter,  the  Great  North  Road,  Lake  Macquarie  and  the  Central   Coast.   The  robber  band  fluctuated  both  in  numbers  and  in  boldness  and  was  relentlessly  hunted.  Their  story  ended  tragically  in  Sydney  on  March  16,1841  on  the  gallows.   Among  those  hanged  was  the  26  year-old  former  stable  boy  Edward  (Teddy)  Davis,  alias  George  Wilkinson,  whose  Jewish  identity  gave  the  defiant  group  of  miscreants  the  name  “the  Jewboy  Gang”.   The  doomed  escapade  began  on  August  12,  1840  when  five  convicts  escaped  from  Sydney’s  Hyde  Park  Barracks  and  took  to  the  bush.   Colin  Roope  and  Patricia  Gregson  expertly  recount  the  details  of  the  132  days  of  freedom  the  gang  enjoyed  before  being  ambushed  and  forced  to  surrender  to  the  troopers  led  by  Maitland’s  heroic  police  mag  istrate  Denny  Day.  Surprisingly,  Edward  Davis  had  only  been  a  mem  ber  of  the  gang  for  its  last  six  weeks  of  action.  Amazement  at  this  bizarre  recruit  caused  the  entire  group  to  be  dubbed  “the  Jewboy  Gang”.   The  authors  hint  that  it  is  just   possible  that  the  name  may  have  resulted  from  an  early  relationship  between  the  bushrangers  and   Michael  John  Davies  —  the  father  of  Edward  Davis.   The  Davies/Davis  family  of  moth  er,  father  and  eight  children  was  remarkable.  The  father  was  a  con  victed  law  clerk.  Brother  John  was  also  a  convict  who  became  chief  constable  of  Bathurst,  a  member  of  the  Tasmanian  Parliament  and  the  founder  of  the  Hobart  Mercury.   By  the  time  young  Teddy  Davis  joined  the  gang,  after  having  absconded  from  at  least  five  work  parties,  the  group  had  become   famous  for  their  dress  sense.   A  contemporary  account  in  the  Sydney  Herald  of  December  1840  describes  their  clothes  as  “rather  gaudy”.  They  wore  “broad-rimmed  Manilla  hats,  turned  up  at  the  front  with  abundance  of  braid  pink  rib  bons,  satin  neck  cloth,  splendid  brooches,  all  of  them  had  rings  and  watches.  One  of  them  (a  Jew  I  believe)  wore  five  rings.”   Inevitably,  in  the  course  of  a  rob  bery,  the  group  went  too  far  and   shot  and  killed  a  victim.  Scores  of  police  combed  the  bush  and  a  brief  gun  battle  at  Doughboy  Hollow  (about  48  kilometres  from  Scone)  ended  with  the  capture  of  the  bushrangers  who  were  brought  in  chains  to  the  metropolis.   The  trial  created  a  sensation  and  the  jury  took  an  hour  and  a  quarter  to  deliver  a  verdict  of  guilty.  Hundreds  of  people  followed  the  condemned  men  to  the  Sydney  Gaol.   More  than  1000  spectators  wit  nessed  their  execution  which  would  be  the  last  mass  hanging  in  Sydney.  Edward  Davis  was  attended  at  the  scaffold  by  the  Reverend  Jacob  Myer  Isaacs  of  the  Sydney  Synagogue  and   was  buried  as  a  Jew.   We  now  know,  thanks  to  the  authors’  research,  that  Edward’s  father  was  present  at  his  son’s  trial  and  probably  at  his  execution.   Following  the  pronouncement  of  the  death  sentence  on  February  19,  1841  Michael  John  Davies  wrote  a  trenchant  letter  to  the  press  protest  ing  that  the  execution  of  six  young  men  was  “a  useless  retribution  for  one  [death]”.   Davies  managed  to  smuggle  into  his  published  protest  the  phrase  that  the  presiding  chief  justice  of  New  South  Wales  was  “beyond  all  praise”.  The  phrase  could,  of  course,  be  read  as  an  obsequious  compli  ment,  but  it  was  clearly  intended  to  be  an  insult.   The  story  of  Edward  Davis  and  the  “Jewboy  Gang”  is  a  typically  Australian  saga  told  with  skill  and  originality.   ■  An  Organised  Banditti  is  available  from  the  Lake  Macquarie  Heritage  Centre,  Victory  Parade,  Toronto  NSW   2283.   ■  John  Levi  is  rabbi  emeritus  of  Temple  Beth  Israel.

"  US  senator  discovers  his  Jewish  roots   NEW  YORK—First  it  was  then  sec  retary  of  State  Madeleine  Albright.  Next  it  was  General  Wesley  Clark,  then  US  allied  commander  in  Europe.  Now  it’s  Democratic  presi  dential  candidate  John  Kerry,  the  Democratic  senator  from  Massachusetts,  whose  Jewish  roots  are  being  reported.   Two  of  Kerry’s  grandparents  were  Jewish,  it  turns  out.  Kerry,  a  practising  Catholic,  said  he  has  known  for  15  years  that  his  paternal  grandmother  was  Jewish,  but  had  unsuccessfully  searched  for  news  of  his  paternal  grandfather’s  roots.   However,  a  genealogist  hired  by  the  Boston  Globe  found  that  Kerry’s  grandfather  was  bom  to  a  Jewish  family  in  a  small  town  in  the  Czech  Republic.   “This  is  incredible  stuff,”  Kerry  told  the  Globe.  “I  think  it  is  more  than  interesting.  It  is  a  revelation.”   The  records  show  that  his  grandfather,  Frederick  Kerry,  was  bom  as  Fritz  Kohn.  He  changed  his  name  to  Kerry  in  1902,  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  1905  —  and  committed  suicide  in  a  Boston  hotel  in  1921.   The  Kerry  story  also  might  hold  lessons  for  the  present  and  future  make-up  of  American  Jewry,  Brandeis  University  Professor  Jonathan  Sama  said.   “The  question  is  if  that  is  going  to  be  seen  a  century  from  now  as  a   Senator  John  Kerry   harbinger  of  where  American  Judaism  is  going,”  Sama  asked.   Kerry  said  he  had  asked  cousins  and  searched  on  the  internet,  but  had  found  only  bits  of  information  on  his  family  history.   Observers  say  the  revelation  about  Kerry  is  unlikely  to  affect  the  2004  presidential  race.   Kerry’s  revelation  adds  another  Jewish  flavour  to  the  2004  race  for  the  Democratic  presidential  nomi  nation.  Senator  Joseph  Lieberman,  who  declared  last  month  that  he  will  seek  the  nomination,  is  an  observant  Jew.  Another  contender,  former  Vermont  governor  Howard  Dean,  is  married  to  a  Jewish  woman  and  is  raising  his  children  as  Jews.   And  Clark,  who  told  the  Forward  recently  that  he  is  descended  from  “generations  of  rabbis”,  is  also  weighing  a  2004  Democratic  presi   dential  bid.   JTA ",2003-02-07
"  The  problems  facing  non-Jewish  Israelis   A  MERE  49  per  cent  of  the  60,000  immigrants  who  arrived  in  Israel  in  2000  are  Jewish,  compared  with  96  per  cent  of  the  immigrants  who   arrived  in  1990.   The  rising  proportion  of  non  Jewish  Israelis  -  the  majority  from  the  former  Soviet  Union—has  cre  ated  a  swag  of  complex  issues  regarding  their  rights.   The  issues  become  even  more  complicated  when  human  rights  issues  come  into  play,  as  when  the  children  of  non-Jewish  immigrants  serve  in  the  military  and  are  killed.   Civil  rights  activists  argue  that  there  is  a  human  rights  issue  that  supersedes  the  question  of  “who  is  a  Jew”,  and  there  is  a  growing  num  ber  of  cases  in  which  Israeli  law  forces  people  to  chose  between  family  and  allegiance  to  the  state.   Former  Australian  Nicole  Maor  —  an  Israeli  attorney  and  an  authority  on  immigrant  rights  and  non-Orthodox  con  versions  —  will  tackle  these  issues  as  a  guest  of  The  Shalom  Insti   tute  on  November  9.   A  graduate  of  North  Sydney  Girls  High  School  and  founding  member  of  Netzer  Sydney,  she  graduated  in  law  from  the  Univer  sity  of  NSW  and  went  on  aliyah.   She  has  been  a  leading  figure  in  the  fight  for  recognition  of  non  Orthodox  weddings  in  Israel,  and  is  director  of  the  Legal  Aid  Centres  for  Olim  Program  -  the  Israel  Religious  Action  Centre’s  legal  advice  bureau  for  immigrants.   Since  2001  she  has  been  a   founding  member  of  the  Reform  congregation  Kehilat  Yonatan  in  Hod  Hasharon.   Maor  will  present  a  seminar  on  “Civil  Rights:  the  challenge  for  Israel”  at  the  Eric  Caspary  Learn  ing  Centre,  UNSW,  speaking  on  aliyah  and  problems  of  the  Law  of  Return,  “State  and  Religion”,  con  version  and  migrant  workers  in   Israel.

"  Mount  Sinai  College  is  part  of  the  Jewish  community.  Not  only  are  children  encouraged  to  see  themselves  as  active  members  of  the  school  community  but  also  of  the  wider  Jewish  community.  We  have  strong  links  with  the  Maroubra  Synagogue,  other  schools  and  other  local  Jewish  institutions.  It  provides  an  outstanding  Jewish  education  that  stresses  and  strives  for  the  positive  integration  of  each  child's  identity  as  an  Australian  Jew.   Mount  Sinai  aims  to  be  active  in  ensuring  Jewish  continuity.  This  can  best  be  summarised  by  the  expression  Talmud  Torah  with  Derech  Eretz.  By  teaching  and  leading  through  example,  students  develop  an  enduring  respect,  love  for  and  an  understanding  of  their  Jewish  heritage.  The  College  fosters  and  develops  ethical  behaviour  derived  from  the  Jewish  moral  and  spiritual  heritage.  Mount  Sinai  creates  a  vibrant  and  challenging  Jewish  learning  environment  Our  stimulating  Jewish  Studies  programs  provide  our  students  with  a  comprehensive  approach  to  Jewish  Learning.  Our  focus  on  the  'whole  chfld'  prepares  our  graduates  to  be  self-directed,  life   long  learners  with  a  strong  Jewish  identity  and  a  commitment  to  Medinat  YisraeL   Mount  .Sinai  children  are  also  taught  to  respect  and  contribute  to  a  wide  range  of  Jewish  and  other  community  charities.  An  example  of  the  College  nurturing  a  Jewish  ethos  amongst  its  students  is  seen  in  the  concept  of  Jewish  charity  (Tzedakah  and  Gemilut  Chasadim)  kindness,  which  is  practised  at  the  College.  Their  efforts  are  coordinated  by  the  Charity  committees  in  Year  6.  The  College  calendar  also  reflects  the  centrality  of  Jewish  festivals  and  Israel  in  its  programs.  Students  are  instructed  so  they  can  celebrate  Chagim  (festivals)  and  honour  commemoration  days  in  a  meaningful  way.   The  aim  of  Jewish  Studies  education  programme  at  Mount  Sinai  is  to  imbue  students  with  the  fundamental  knowledge  of  their  Jewish  heritage  and  a  positive  sense  of  self-identity.  To  ensure  these  goals,  students  embark  upon  the  successful  Tal  Am  /  Tal  Sela  global  method  Hebrew  program.  Their  Hebrew  skills  are  further  utilised  in  their  lessons  of  Torah,  parasha  (the  weekly  portion)  and  Chagim  (holidays  and  festivals). ",2003-05-16

There  was  no  representative   from  South  Africa.

Restitution  for  Jews  forced  out  of  Arab  lands  was  also  discussed.   “The  feeling  was  that  it  was  part  of  Jewish  history  which  had  been  neglected  for  too  long,”  Jones  said.   “Just  as  there  were  Holocaust  survivors  who  didn’t  talk  about   their  experiences  until  40  years  had  passed,  with  Iraq  it’s  only  now  that  children  are  being  told  by  their  par  ents  what  they  went  through.”   Regarding  Australia:  “We  saw  how  advanced  we  were  in  identify   Canadian  Jewish  Congress  president  Keith  Landy,  Executive  Council  of   Australian  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones.   ing  problems.

"  The  deia  vu   PARTISAN   SAMUPSKI   o   Some  commentators   believe  that  the  figure  of  Russian  immigrants  who   want  to  convert  to  Judaism  would  be   considerably  higher  than  100,000  if  the  Orthodox  did  not  deliberately  make  it  so  difficult.   JUST  when  you  thought  you  had   forgotten  it  was  still  a  burning  issue,  “Who  is  a  Jew?”  is  back  on  Israel’s  agenda,  and  therefore  on   world  Jewry  s.   For  how  Israel  resolves  the  ongoing  dispute  about  Jewish  identi  ty  is  ultimately  as  critical  for,  say,  Perth’s  7000  or  so  Jews  as  it  is  for  San  Paulo’s  100,000.   Boring,  you  say.  I  agree.  “Who  is  a  Jew?”  brings  on  deja  vu.  I’d  like  noth  ing  better  than  to  forget  about  yet   another  row  between  Orthodox  and   non-Orthodox  Israelis  and  hope  that  they  could  too.  At  least  until  they’ve  coped  with  the  fateful  decisions  affecting  their  long-term  external  security  that  now  face  them.   But  it’s  not  so  simple.  Israel’s  secu  rity,  of  course,  is  also  an  internal  issue.  Whether  in  the  20th  and  21st  century,  or  20  centuries  earlier,  history  reminds  us  that  a  Jewish  state  can  only  survive  if  it  can  manage  its  inter   nal  divisions.   True,  the  unity  of  the  Jewish  peo  ple,  even  (or  especially)  in  its  own  land,  has  always  been  a  myth.  But  at   least  modem  Israel,  thus  far,  has  been  able  to  contain  those  differences,  if  only  because  the  external  threat  has  loomed  so  large  for  so  long.   For  the  last  five  years  the  uneasy  containment  of  “Who  is  a  Jew?”  has  occurred  largely  under  the  umbrella  of  the  Ne’eman  Plan.  It  was  then  finance  minister  Ya’acov  Ne’eman   whose  committee  developed  the  compromise  in  1998  that  allowed  Conservative  and  Reform  rabbis  to   participate  in  the  conversion  process,   but  left  the  conversion  ritual  to  an  Orthodox  beth  din.   As  compromises  go  it  was  about  the  best  that  anybody  could  have  hoped  for  at  the  time.  But  it  has  not  fulfilled  the  expectations  of  the  mod  erates  on  all  sides.  And  that’s  mainly   because  the  Chief  Rabbinate  and  the  ultra-Orthodox  didn’t  want  it  to  suc  ceed.   The  latest  “Who  is  a  Jew?”  debate  flared  earlier  this  month  when  Interi  or  Minister  Avraham  Poraz,  a  mem  ber  of  the  anti-clerical  Shinui  party,  told  a  Knesset  committee  that,  for  the  purposes  of  citizenship,  the  state   should  recognise  conversions  by   Reform  and  Conservative  rabbis  in  Israel  alongside  those  by  the  Ortho   dox  rabbinate.   A  radical  step.  But  Poraz  had  mod  ified  an  even  more  radical  proposal  to  separate  citizenship  and  religious  sta  tus  altogether  after  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  had  warned  him  not  even  to  think  about  it.  The  Orthodox  monopoly  had  to  remain  intact,  Sharon  insisted.  But  the  prime  minis  ter  did  urge  the  state  rabbinate  to  act  on  the  conversion  backlog,  saying:  “Whoever  wishes  to  link  his  fate  with  ours  should  be  allowed  to  do  so  as  quickly  as  possible.”   These  are  profoundly  important  words,  and  what  lies  behind  them  helps  to  explain  why,  this  time  around,  the  conversion  issue,  poten  tially,  is  even  more  combustible  than  in  its  previous  manifestations.   Sharon  was  mainly  referring  to  the  300,000  Russian  immigrants  who’ve  come  to  Israel  in  the  past  20  years  or  so  whom  the  rabbinate  does  not  con  sider  halachically  Jewish.  As  Elli  Wohlgelemter  reported  in  the  New   York  Forward,  surveys  suggest  that  some  100,000  of  these  immigrants,  many  of  them  serving  in  the  Israel  Defence  Forces,  and  their  families  want  to  convert  to  Judaism.  And  some  commentators  believe  that  the   figure  would  be  considerably  higher  if  the  Orthodox  did  not  deliberately   make  conversion  so  difficult  -  the  critics  say  impossible  -  and  if  Conser  vative  and  Reform  rabbis  could  be  more  involved.   There’s  another  point.  This  time  it’s  not  primarily  about  the  resentment  felt  by  large  numbers  of  Diaspora  -  particularly  North  American  -  Jews  at  the  lack  of  recog  nition  and  legitimacy  accorded  non   Orthodox  rabbis.  It’s  about  the   Jewishness  of  large  numbers  of  Israelis,  especially  those  ready  to  serve  and  die  in  the  IDF,  and  the  immense  implications  that  holds  for  the  questions  of  marriage  and  divorce,  birth,  death  and  burial.   Even,  we  might  say,  for  Israel’s  very  security.   Sam  Lipski  is  a  former  editor  of  the  AJN.   His  column  appears  monthly. ",2003-07-18
"  Growth  of  Jewish  liberalism   BOOK  REVIEW   PHILIP  MENDES   TORN  AT  THE  ROOTS:  THE  CRISIS  OF  JEWISH  LIBERALISM  IN  POSTWAR  AMERICA  Michael  Staub   Columbia  University  Press,  2002,386  pages,  $50   .AMERICAN  Jewry  has  long  been   divided  between  universalists  who   see  Jews  as  having  a  wider  social  reform  responsibility,  and  particularists  who  believe  they  should  concentrate  on  defending  specific  Jewish  interests.   This  fascinating  text  by  Michael  Staub  explores  this  divide  with  regard  to  the  key  intra-Jewish  ideological  conflicts  of  post-World  War  II.   Particular  attention  is  drawn  to  the  means  by  which  conflicting  interpre  tations  of  the  lessons  of  the  Holocaust  influenced  these  debates.   Staub  takes  aim  at  a  number  of  conventional  interpretations  of  American  Jewish  political  and  ideological  agendas.   Firstly,  he  rejects  the  assumed  association  between  Jews  and  politi  cal  liberalism.  While  he  acknowledges  that  Jews  were  consistently  more  politically  liberal  than  most  white  American  ethnic  groups  and  that  many  Jews  were  liberal  and  even  radical,  he  argues  that  the  specific  association  between  Jews  and  liberal  ism  was  dead  as  early  as  1960.   Secondly,  he  argues  that  the  demise  of  the  Jewish-black  alliance  can  be  attributed  as  much  to  the  early  manifestations  of  Jewish  neo-conser  vatism  as  to  later  black  antisemitism.   Thirdly,  Staub  rejects  the  assumption  that  the  Jewish  radicals  of  the  1960s  were  all  self-hating  Jews  and  their  critics  were  seeking  to  protect  traditional  Jewish  values.   Rather,  he  notes  that  many  new  left  Jews  were  seeking  to  articulate  a  -  more  ethnic  Jewish  identity,  while  the   older  Jewish  establishment  preferred   to  assimilate  to  dominant  American   values.  Staub  rejects  the  notion  that  progressive  Jewish  activists  were  motivated  by  secular  rather  than  religious  factors.  On  the  contrary,  he  notes  that  many  Jewish  liberals  were  specifically  inspired  by  religious   values  and  traditions.   Analogies  between   the  Holocaust  and  the  prevalence  of  white  racism  and   antisemitism  in  the   US  became  politically  problematic.   Staub  begins  his  study  with  an  examination  of  Jewish  anti-commu  nism  during  the  Cold  War.  Using  case  examples  from  both  the  Rosenberg  spy  trial  and  the  black  press,  he  notes  that  analogies  between  the  Holocaust  and  the  prevalence  of  white  racism  and  antisemitism  in  the  US  became  politically  problematic.   It  is  true  that  many  reform  rabbis  and  Zionists  (influenced  by  prophetic  Judaism)  employed  the  Holocaust  as  a  rationale  for  their  involvement  in  the  civil-rights  movement.   And  mainstream  Jewish  organisa  tions  remained  prominent  supporters  of  the  civil-rights  movement.  But  equally  many  other  Jews  rejected  this  association,  and  challenged  the  Jew  ishness  of  civil-rights  activists.   Overall,  there  was  considerable  evidence  of  a  Jewish  backlash  against  liberal-social  programs  and  desegre  gation  policies.   Intra-Jewish  ideological  conflict  also  came  to  a  head  over  the  Vietnam  War.  On  the  one  hand,  many  Jewish  opponents  of  the  war  used  the  Holo  caust  analogy  to  justify  their  posi  tions,  and  Jewish  participation  in  the  moratorium  movement  was  signifi   cant.   But  at  the  same  time  much  popu  lar  Jewish  opinion  -  particularly  that  of  Orthodox  Jews  -  was  supportive  of   the  war.   Later,  the  Six-Day  War  crystallised  this  debate  as  many  Jews  began  to  question  whether  they  could  oppose  the  US  presence  in  Vietnam  while  simultaneously  seeking  American  military  support  for  Israel.   The  growth  of  radical  Jewish  groups  provoked  a  significant  back   lash.  Contributors  to  the  neo  conservative  Commentary  magazine  attacked  radical  Jews  as  dysfunctional  self-haters  whose  actions  were  likely  to  increase  antisemitism.   Explicit  attempts  were  made  to  limit  expressions  of  public  Jewish  dis   sent.  Much  of  this  discourse  resem  bles  our  own  contemporary  debates  around  the  role  of  dissenting  groups  such  as  the  Australian  Jewish  Democ  ratic  Society,  and  Jews  for  a  Just  Peace.   Overall,  this  is  an  outstanding  study  of  the  limits  and  complexities  of  American  Jewish  liberalism,  and  the  intricacies  of  modern  Jewish  political  and  ethnic  identity.   Dr  Philip  Mendes  is  a  senior  lecturer  in   social  policy  and  community  development  at  Monash  University  and  co-editor  of  a  proposed  new  text  on  Jews   and  Australian  politics.

"  Jewish-Muslim  friendship  in  Sharif  film   TOMTUGEND   LOS  ANGELES  -  “I  was  filming  Funny  Girl  with  Barbra  Streisand  in  1967  when  the  Six-Day  War  broke  out  and  the  Arab  press  called  me  a  traitor  for  kissing  a  Jewish  woman,”   reminisced  veteran  actor  Omar  Sharif.   “When  I  told  Barbra  about  it,”  Sharif  added,  “she  said,  ‘You  should  see  the  letter  my  aunt  wrote  about  kissing  an  Arab  man!’”   Sharif’s  latest  film,  Monsieur  Ibrahim,  is  a  love  story  of  a  different  kind  between  an  elderly  Muslim  and  an  abandoned  Jewish  boy.   It  screened  during  this  year’s  Jew  ish  film  festival  and  is  expected  to  be  released  in  cinemas  next  year.   Sharif  s  title  character  is  the  owner   of  a  small  food  market  on  a  seedy  Paris  street,  where  Orthodox  Jews  do  their  best  to  ignore  the  parade  of  prostitutes  and  their  customers.   In  a  small  apartment  above  the  street  lives  16-year-old  Moise,  nick  named  Momo.  Abandoned  by  his  mother,  Momo  lives  with  his  morose  father,  cooking  his  meals  and  driving  him  crazy  with  ear-splitting  rock   music  on  a  transistor  radio.   Momo  also  does  the  shopping  for  the  truncated  family  at  Ibrahim’s  market  and  rationalises  his  petty  thievery  there  because  he  believes  it’s  all  right  to  steal  from  an  Arab.   Ibrahim  is  actually  not  an  Arab,  but  a  Turkish  Muslim  who  imparts  philosophical  musings  from  his  per   sonalised  interpretation  of  the  Koran  to  the  boy.   Momo  is  Jewish,  but  he  links  the  faith  of  his  ancestors  mainly  to  his  father’s  depression.  When  the  father  walks  out  on  the  boy  to  find  a  job,  Momo’s  only  friend  -  outside  of  the   hookers  whom  he  has  started  to   patronise  -  is  Ibrahim.   Despite^moving  performances  by  Sharif  and  by  Pierre  Boulanger  as  Momo,  and  director  Francois  Dupey  ron’s  description  of  the  picture  as  “a  hymn  to  tolerance,  a  cry  for  hope”,  the   French  film  suffers  from  excessive   sentimentality.   I  The  lesson  of  the  film   is  that  “we  can  live   together  and  can  love  |  each  other”.   I  OMAR  SHARIF   Actor   Jewish  viewers  may  also  feel  uneasy  by  the  contrast  between  Ibrahim’s  strong  Muslim  faith  and  the  way  Momo  views  his  Judaism  as  meaningless.   Sharif  seemed  taken  aback  by  the  last  observation.  “The  only  objection  I  heard  from  French  Jews  was  that  no  Jewish  mother  would  ever  abandon  her  child,”  he  said.   At  71,  Sharif  is  greyer  and  more  pensive  than  when  he  broke  women’s  hearts  from  Cairo  to  Los  Angeles,  but  he  is  still  a  handsome  and  well-built   Veteran  actor  Omar  Sharif  in  the  French  film  Monsieur  Ibrahim.

Already  a  star  in  his  native  Egypt,  he  came  to  Hollywood  in  1962,  and  during  the  following  six  years  won   international  fame  in  three  movies:   he  played  an  Arab  desert  warrior  in  Lawrence  of  Arabia,  the  title  role  in  Dr  Zhivago  and  a  Jewish  gambler  in  Funny  Girl.   Since  then,  he’s  mainly  been   involved  in  films  considered  second  rate.  Bom  Catholic  but  later  convert   ing  to  Islam,  Sharif  is  widely  read  and   has  followed  the  Arab-Israeli  conflict   with  great  interest  and  sorrow.   He  still  considers  Egyptian  presi  dent  Anwar  Sadat’s  1977  peace  mis  sion  to  Israel  as  “the  greatest  moment  in  television  history,  greater  than  man  stepping  on  the  moon”.   In  Cairo  in  the  late  1970s,  Sharif  met  Ariel  Sharon,  who  urged  the  actor  to  visit  his  many  fans  in  Israel,  but  Sharif  said  he  does  not  plan  to  take  up  the  invitation  until  there  is  “a  glimmer  of  peace”.   His  views  on  an  Israeli-Palestinian   settlement  parallel  those  of  such  dovish  Israelis  as  Yossi  Beilin,  but  Sharif  holds  out  littie  hope  for  peace   soon.   He  expects  that  his  new  film’s  mes  sage  will  resonate  in  Israel,  where  local  distributors  purchased  the  film  for  the  highest  price  they  ever  paid  for  a  French  import.   If  viewers  take  anything  away  from  the  movie,  he  hopes  it  will  be  the  les  son  that  “we  can  live  together  and  can   love  each  other.   JTA ",2003-11-28
"  Bid  to  block  Jewish  Muslim  forum   ALANA  ROSENBAUM   A  RABBI  and  a  Muslim  academic  will  debate  religion  next  week  at  a  controversial  forum  on  Islam  and  Judaism.

"  Jewish  footnotes  to  Hillary  Clintons  history   10E  BERKOFSKY   NEW  YORK  -  Soon  after  the  Monica  Lewinsky  scandal  erupted,  Hillary  Rodham  Clinton  encountered  Elie  Wiesel  in  Davos,  Switzerland.   The  Nobel  laureate  embraced  the  first  lady  and  asked,  “What  is  wrong  with  America?  Why  are  they  doing   this?”   Clinton  said  she  did  not  know,  and  Wiesel  replied  that  he  and  his  wife,  Marion,  were  her  friends  and  “want  to  help  you”.   “[Wiesel’s]  experience  as  a  Holo  caust  survivor  has  given  Elie  a  kind  of  genius  for  empathy.  He  never  flinches  from  anyone  else’s  suffering,  and  his  heart  is  big  enough  to  absorb  a  friend’s  pain  without  a  second  thought,”  Clinton  writes  in  her  new  autobiography,  Living  History,  which  hit  bookstores  with  a  huge  media  splash  on  Monday.   While  the  Lewinsky  affair  may  be  dominating  the  media  swirl  around  the  launch  of  Clinton’s  hotly-selling  title,  Jews  and  events  in  the  Jewish  world  play  roles  big  and  small  in  Clin  ton’s  story.   Among  Jewish  footnotes  to  Clin  ton’s  history  is  a  phone  conversation  she  had  with  Steve  Rabinowitz,  a  for  mer  campaign  figure  and  later  White   House  staffer  for  Bill  Clinton.   The  former  first  lady  describes  how  she  called  the  campaign’s  Litde  Rock,  Arkansas,  headquarters  one  day.   Rabinowitz,  the  director  of  design  and  production  for  Clinton’s  first  presidential  election,  picked  up  the  phone  and  “for  no  particular  reason,  blurted  out,  ‘Hillaryland!’”   “He  was  embarrassed  to  hear  my   voice,  but  I  thought  he  had  come  up  with  a  great  nickname,”  Clinton  writes.  “The  name  stuck.”   When  he  learned  he  had  made  it  into  Clinton’s  index,  Rabinowitz  said,  “I  am  flattered  that  she  would  even  remember  that,  and  beyond  grateful  that  is  the  only  story  she  would  tell.”   Rabinowitz  later  travelled  with  the   president  to  Israel  several  times  and  orchestrated  the  logistics  for  the  Sep  tember  1993  peace-treaty  signing  cer  emony  on  the  White  House  lawn  in  which  then  prime  minister  Yitzhak  Rabin  and  Palestinian  Authority  Chairman  Yasser  Arafat  shook  hands.   The  former  first  lady  turned  US  senator  refers  admiringly  and  affec  tionately  to  the  late  Rabin  and  his  wife,  Leah,  and  writes  that  the  Israeli  leader  only  agreed  to  the  Arafat  hand  shake  “as  long  as  there  would  be  no  kissing,  a  common  Arab  custom”.   “Before  the  [White   House]  ceremony,  Bill   and  Yitzhak  engaged  in  a  hilarious  rehearsal  of  the  handshake,  with  Bill  pretending  to  be   Arafat...”   HILLARY  RODHAM  CLINTON   US  senator   “Before  the  ceremony,  Bill  and  Yitzhak  engaged  in  a  hilarious  rehearsal  of  the  handshake,  with  Bill  pretending  to  be  Arafat  as  they  prac  tised  a  complicated  manoeuvre  that  would  prevent  the  Palestinian  leader  from  drawing  too  close,”  Clinton   recalls.   The  cover  of  Hillary  Rodham  Clinton’s  tell-all  book.   Clinton,  the  junior  Democratic  senator  from  New  York  and  a  poten  tial  presidential  candidate  in  2008,  is  far  less  complimentary  about  Arafat,  at  one  point  blasting  the  Palestinian  leader  for  the  failed  2000  peace  talks  with  then  Israeli  prime  minister  Ehud   Barak.   “Unfortunately,  while  Barak  came  to  Camp  David  to  make  peace,  Arafat  did  not,”  she  says  bluntly.  “The  tragic  events  of  the  last  few  years  show  what  a  terrible  mistake  Arafat  made.”   Clinton  also  calls  a  now-infamous  1999  encounter  with  Arafat’s  wife,  Suha,  the  “worst  instance”  of  mistakes  she  made  during  her  campaign  for  the  Senate,  which  she  launched  even  before  she  left  the  White  House.   During  an  official  trip  to  Israel  and  the  West  Bank,  Clinton  attended  an   event  where  Suha  spoke  before  her  in  Arabic  and  made  an  “outrageous  remark  suggesting  that  Israel  had  used  poison  gas  to  control  Palestini  ans”,  Clinton  writes.   Arafat’s  remark  was  not  translated  into  English,  Clinton  says,  and  when  the  first  lady  stepped  to  the  podium  to  speak,  the  two  women  embraced  -  and  the  New  York  tabloids  played  the  story  big.   “Had  I  been  aware  of  her  hateful  words,  I  would  have  denounced  them  on  the  spot,”  she  says,  repeating  asser   tions  she  made  at  the  time.   In  her  book,  Clinton  recalls  sever  al  trips  to  Poland  in  the  late  1990s  that  took  her  to  Nazi  death  camps  and  the  Warsaw  Jewish  community.  The  visit,  she  writes,  prompted  memories  of  meeting  a  survivor  with  numbers  tat  tooed  on  his  arm  when  she  was  a  child  in  Illinois,  and  to  think  of  her  maternal  grandmother’s  second  hus  band,  Max  Rosenberg.   “I  was  horrified  that  someone  like   him  could  have  been  murdered  just  because  of  his  religion,”  she  says.   Clinton,  who  spends  a  lot  of  time  explaining  -  in  the  book  and  in  inter  views  -  why  she  stayed  married  to  her  husband,  writes  that  it  was  a  long  time  Jewish  friend  and  mentor,  Sara  Ehrman,  to  whom  she  long  ago   turned  for  advice  about  Bill.   Ehrman,  a  Washington  room  mate  of  Clinton  in  the  early  1970s  during  the  Watergate  era  tried  to  per  suade  Hillary  not  to  move  to  Arkansas  to  be  with  Bill.  “Are  you  out  of  your  mind?”  Clinton  recalls  Ehrman  asking.  “Why  on  earth  would  you  throw  away  your  future?”  JTA ",2003-06-13

"  on   SIMON  SEGAL   THE  trend  is  dear:  while  still  vastly  disproportionate  to  its  population,  the  Jewish  presence  on  Business  Review  Weekly’s  list  of  the  200  richest  people  in  Australia  is  dedining.   In  her  book  Edge  of  the  Diaspora,  Suzanne  Rutland  wrote  that  in  1986  there  were  50  Jews  on  BRWs  annual  Rich  200  list.  The  latest  list,  published  last  week,  includes  “just”  29.   Last  year  there  were  32;  in  2000  34;   and  in  1999  37.   With  only  three  Jews  in  the  Top  200  aged  under  50,  and  10  are  over  75,  this  trend  is  likely  to  accelerate.   The  past  year  has  seen  the  death  of  Stockland  Trust’s  Ervin  Graf  (ranked  183  last  year),  the  departure  of  tech  nology  investors  Alan  and  Elizabeth  Finkel  (141)  and  Myer  Herszberg  (159),  and  the  shift  of  John  and  Stan  ley  Roth  to  the  family  listing  section.   Jewish  newcomers  to  this  year’s  Rich  200  are  Arrow  Pharmaceutical’s  David  and  Paul  Duchen.   Two  Jews  dropped  off  the  list  last  year  -  Rodney  Adler  ($80  million  in  2001)  and  MYOB  co-founder  Brad  Shofer  ($105  million).   In  1999  four  Jews  left  the  list  -  Joseph  Gutnick,  Nathan  Baron,  Henry  Krongold  and  Bela  Schwartz,  although  the  Schwartz  family  is  still  included).  Myer  Herszberg  was  then  the  only  Jewish  addition.   A  factor  behind  the  drop  in  Jewish  representation  is  the  decline  of  the  Holocaust  generation  and  a  shift  towards  a  more  professional  ethos  as  the  community  becomes  more  estab   lished.   The  refugee  immigration  from  Europe  before  and  after  World  War  II  changed  the  complexion  of  the  com  munity  towards  becoming  more   viable.   A  key  part  of  the  Jewish  success  story  in  corporate  Australia  is  one  of  refugees,  or  children  of  refugees,  motivated  to  create  a  new,  secure  life  in  a  land  free  from  persecution.   Wth  the  decline  of  this  generation  and  the  rising  affluence  of  the  broad  er  Jewish  community,  part  of  this  drive  seems  to  have  subsided.   Of  the  29  Jews  on  this  year’s  Rich  200,  only  nine  are  Australian-born.   Despite  dropping,  the  numbers  are  still  striking.  Of  the  wealthiest  200  Australians,  the  29  Jews  on  it  have  a  combined  wealth  of  $17.8  billion—28   Richard  Pratt...  $3.8bn.   Frank  Lowy...  $3.7bn.   John  Gandel...  $1.7bn.   Harry  Triguboff...  $1.6bn.   Marc  Besen...  $923m.   Solomon  Lew...  $805m.   Joseph  Gutnick...  off  the  list.   The  cover  of  BRW.   per  cent  of  the  $63.2  billion  total  (27  per  cent  last  year).  Four  of  the  top  six  names  are  Jewish.   This  representation  is  vastly  dis  proportionate  for  a  community  that  officially  numbers  83,993(unofficially  110,000)  -  barely  0.5  per  cent  of  Aus  tralia’s  population  of  almost  20  mil  lion  people.   Australia’s  Jews  have  contributed  in  no  small  part  to  the  nation’s  trans  formation  from  a  pastoral  economy  to  a  sophisticated  industrial  economy.  The  numbers  alone  do  not  reflect  the  colourful  characters  and  success  sto  ries;  most  of  the  Jews  on  the  Rich  200  are  inspiring  rags-to-riches  tales.  No  other  ethnic  or  religious  group  comes  close  to  matching  this  performance  on  a  proportional  basis.   If  there  are  common  sentiments   running  through  the  successes,  it  is  gratitude  to  the  country  for  the  opportunities  presented  and  for  the  freedom  and  security  to  prosper;  focus  and  hard  work;  a  drive  motivat  ed  by  a  survival  mentality  (more  common  among  the  older  genera  tion);  and  pride  in  their  contribution.   Australia’s  open  conditions  have  allowed  Jewish  businesses  to  flourish.  The  Old  Boys  Club  is  no  longer  where  the  power  is;  it  now  rests  with  indi  viduals  who  wield  influence  through  reputation  and  success,  rather  than  through  a  group.  This  is  a  substantial   shift.   Dr  Rutland  observes  that  “Aus  tralia  became  the  only  European  set  tlement  where  Jews  were  present   from  the  moment  of  inception,  resulting  in  the  least  intense  struggle  for  Jewish  emancipation  and  the  unique  experience  of  initial  accept  ance  of  Jews  into  the  relatively  open  frontier  society  of  colonial  Australia”.   Running  large  organisations  which  deal  with  the  wider  communi  ty  -  and  for  historic  reasons  of  perse  cution  -  most  Jews  on  the  Rich  200  are  reluctant  to  draw  attention  to  their  Jewishness.  BRW’s  researchers  observe  that  the  Jews  on  the  list  are  among  the  more  discreet  of  the  Rich   200.   Different  generations,  back  grounds,  origins  and  religious  obser  vance  make  it  impossible  to  talk  about  any  homogenous  “Jewish  busi  ness  community”  or  any  particularly  “Jewish  way”  of  doing  business.   Holocaust  ,  survivors  were  poorer,  and  thus  hungrier  for  success,  bring  ing  nothing  but  European  know   how.  The  South  Africans  are  not   refugees  in  the  sense  of  fleeing  geno  cide,  but  many  arrived  here  with  rela  tive  privilege,  education,  assets,  a  common  language  and  a  recognisable   culture.   Melbourne’s  Jews  mainly  originat  ed  from  Eastern  Europe,  either  from  Poland  or  as  Holocaust  survivors.   Sydney  Jews  are  mostly  from  Central  Europe,  largely  Hungary.  This  has  produced  different  economic  pat  terns.  Polish-bom  Jews  have  tended  towards  private  companies,  while  Hungarian-born  Jews  are  more  inclined  to  public  companies.   As  with  Australia  at  large,  the  Jews  in  Melbourne  are  more  old-monied  and  “establishment”;  of  the  29  Jews  on  the  Top  200,  16  are  from  Mel   bourne  and  all  of  these  are  over  50.   Other  patterns  can  be  identified:  wealth  has  been  gained  from  informal  family-owned  private  businesses,  rather  than  public  companies.  Many  have  gone  on  to  become  public  com  panies,  but  the  wealth  created  has  been  by  the  family’s  equity  in  the  cor  poration.   Jews  have  shied  away  from  the  less  mobile  heavy  industry  sectors.  They  started  primarily  in  the  textile  or  fash  ion  industry,  where  it  was  easier  to  borrow  money  and  many  immigrants  were  skilled  for  clothing  manufac  ture.  Many  moved  to  property  from  retail.  Half  of  the  Jews  on  the  Rich  200  have  obtained  their  fortune  primarily  from  property. ",2003-05-30
"  Jewish  films  in  running  for  Oscars   TOMTUGEND   LOS  ANGELES  -  The  Pianist,  the  film  based  on  a  memoir  by  a  survivor  of  the  Warsaw   Ghetto,  has  earned  a  great  deal  of  attention  in  the  run-up  to  Sunday’s  Academy  Awards.   But  the  Roman  Polanski  film,  nominated  for  seven  Oscars,  is  not  the  only  Jewish  themed  film  up  for  an  Oscar.   Nowhere  in  Africa  is  nomi  nated  for  best  foreign  lan  guage  film,  and  Prisoner  in   Paradise  received  a  nomina   tion  in  the  documentary  fea  ture  category.   Australian  director  Steve  Pasvolskys  film  Inja  has  been  nominated  in  the  short  film  (five  action)  category.   Nowhere  in  Africa  explores  the  trials  and  triumphs  of  a  German-Jewish  family  forced  to  flee  in  the  1930s.  Their  unlikely  destination  is  Kenya.   Prisoner  of  Paradise  focuses  on  Kurt  Gerron,  a  Jewish  artist  whose  German  career  came  to   an  end  on  April  1,1933,  when  ail  “non-Aryans”  were  evicted   from  the  set  of  a  film  he  was  directing.   He  was  deported  to  There  sienstadt.  The  Nazis  decided  to  make  a  propaganda  film  and  chose  Gerron  as  director.   The  ludicrous  film,  The  Fuhrer  Gives  the  Jews  a  City,  was  never  shown.   Gerron  was  eventually  killed  at  Auschwitz.   The  Academy  Awards  will  screen   on  Channel  9  on  March  24  at   7.30pm.  Nowhere  in  Africa  opens   in  Australia  next  month. ",2003-03-21
"  CENTRE-STAGE   DEBBIE  MAYER   IT'S  midnight,  three  days  after  Rosh  Hashanah  and  I  can't  sleep.  I  decide  to  read  up  on  the  10  days  of  awe  leading  up  to  Yom  Kippur.   I  turn  to  one  of  the  (ashamedly)  few  reference  books  I  own  -  The  Busy  Soul:  Ten-Minute  spiritual  workouts  drawn  from  Jewish  tradi  tion  by  Rabbi  Terri  Bookman.   While  reflecting  on  the  high  holy  days,  thoughts  of  the  TV  show  I  watched  earlier  tonight,  Queer  Eye  for  the  Straight  Guy,  interject.   The  program  is  a  reality  TV  show  where  five  gay  men  work  on  ""improving""  the  looks,  home,  food  and  social  skills  of  a  hetero  sexual  male.   As  a  traditionally  non-TV  watch  ing  person,  especially  not  of  reality  TV  shows,  I  was  transfixed,  desper   ate  to  watch  the  transformation  of   this  fairly  unattractive,  long-haired,  unkempt  guy,  into  a  tanned,  short  haired,  well-groomed  chic  magnet.  What  was  the  appeal?   Perhaps  it's  a  fascination  we  have  for  personal  transformation,  especially  of  the  vicarious  kind.  After  the  show  I  couldn't  keep  still.   I  picked  things  up  from  the  floor,  cleaning  more  furiously  than  I  have  in  a  long  time.   So  where's  the  connection  between  this  and  Rosh  Hashanah?  It  seems  a  sense  of  transformation  is  inherent  in  any  time  of  renewal,  and  Rosh  Hashanah  is  that  time,  if  ever  there  was  one  in  the  Jewish  calendar.   As  Rabbi  Bookman  writes:  ""To  be  new.  To  begin  again.  To  not  be  held  back  by  past  mistakes,  errors,  flaws,  sins"".  What  a  powerful  notion,  where  a  new  year  means  ""anything  is  possible"".   As  an  actor  and  drama  teacher,  it  is  this  process  of  transformation  (albeit  often  temporary)  that  I  find  exhilarating,  both  personally  and   to  witness  in  students.   Whether  change  is  brought  about  through  the  use  of  masks,  props,  or  costumes,  or  simply  because  of  the  creative  licence  implied  by  the  drama  space,  stu  dents  are  encouraged  to  explore  new  ideas,  and  to  try  out  (in  a  rel   atively  safe  environment)  new  ways  of  behaving  and  thinking.  Like  Rosh  Hashanah,  in  drama,  anything  is  possible.   On  a  personal  level,  Rosh  Hashanah  is  about  letting  go  of  the  past,  and  forgiveness.  That  I  find  particularly  tough.   But  what  if,  instead  of  five  gay  men  transforming  me  to  their  taste,  it  was  God  advising  me  on  ways  to  improve  on  a  deeper  level?  What  a  reality  TV  show  that  would  make.  A  Jewish  make-over  -  I  can  see  it  now.   The  four  archangels  -  Michael,  Gabriel,  Avriel  and  Raphael  -  advis  ing  me  on  different  principles  of  Jewish  living.   I  was  desperate  to  |  watch  the   j  transformation  of  this   unkempt  guy  into  a   tanned,  well-groomed  chic  magnet   What  a  relief  it  would  be  having  such  ""people""  encouraging  and  pushing  you  along  in  life,  making  sure  (by  televised  cameras)  that  you  were  doing  well,  keeping  on  track.  Then  again,  it  also  sounds  like  a  nagging  neurotic  mother.   It's  no  wonder  so  many  Orthodox  Jews  don't  have  TV  sets.   And  if  Rosh  Hashanah  is  about  ""shifting  our  focus  from  an  anthro  pocentric  (human-centred)  uni  verse  to  a  theopocentric  (God-centred)  one"",  as  Rabbi  Bookman  writes,  then  I  imagine  the  only  reality  TV  they  might  be  watching  these  high  holy  days  is  reality  Teshuvah  -  repenting  for   one's  sins.   But  for  now  I'm  going  to  try  to  let  go  and  hopefully  drift  off  to  sleep,  perchance  to  dream  ...  of  winged  men  in  white  robes,  halos  and  sparkling  teeth,  ready  to  take   on  a  new  recruit.

"  The  Jewish  lobby:  It’s  democracy   EVERYONE  lobbies,  declared  Premier  Bob  Carr  in  an  interview  with   the  Australian  Jewish  News  earlier  this  year.  “Everyone  has  a  point  of  view.  The  Jewish  community  has  access  to  government.  It  has  the  respect  of  government.  It  gets  response  from  government”   Speaking  to  the  AJN  days  later,  NSW  Opposition  Leader  John  Brogden  was  equally  emphatic.   “Any  community  lobbying  government  or  opposition  is  essential,”  he  asserted.  “Communities  representing  their  views  to  their  members  of  par  liament  is  a  legitimate  and  necessary  part  of  our  vibrant  democracy.   “Jews  in  Australia  have  every  right  to  demonstrate  attachment  to  Israel  To  criticise  the  Jewish  lobby  is  offensive  and  out  of  touch.”   Despite  this  seemingly  self-evident  truth,  there  is  an  apparent  obsession  in  some  quarters  with  the  perceived  power  of  the  Jewish  lobby.   The  point  needs  to  be  reiterated:  there  is  nothing  wrong  with  lobbying.  It  is  a  legitimate  part  of  the  democratic  process.   Groups  and  individuals  with  vested  interests  lobby  as  a  matter  of  course  -  environmentalists,  native  title  campaigners,  animal  rights  activists,  anti  abortionists,  Jewish  leaders.  They  all  do  it;  and  so  they  should.   It  is  part  of  what  makes  a  free  society  free  and  our  political  leaders  accountable  and  accessible,  so  that  voters  can  attempt  to  persuade  them  of  the  validity  and  importance  of  particular  issues.   By  definition,  some  lobbyists  are  better  organised,  some  have  more  visi  ble  profiles,  some  are  more  effective.  But  all  strive  to  promote  the  rightness  of  their  cause.  That  is  what  lobbyists  do.   It  is  therefore  highly  offensive  for  the  Jewish  community  to  be  singled  out   and  pilloried  for  its  lobbying  efforts,  as  has  occurred  in  recent  weeks  and  months  -  most  notably  by  Sydney  Morning  Herald  columnist  Alan  Ram  sey  and  Federal  Labor  backbencher  Julia  Irwin.   It  is  entirely  appropriate  to  take  issue  with  specific  arguments  proposed  by  lobbyists.  It  is  entirely  inappropriate,  however,  to  deem  lobbying  a  sinis  ter  operation,  which  is  what  has  occurred  with  regard  to  the  Jewish  lobby.   Referring  to  the  Opposition  Leader’s  recent  address  to  Melbourne  Jewish  leaders,  Ramsey  opined  that  Crean  was  attempting  “to  mollify  the  influen  tial  (and  wealthy)  pro-Israeli  lobby”.  There  is  nothing  wrong  with  referring  to  the  “influential  pro-Israeli  lobby”  -  but  wealthy?   Apart  from  the  rank  generalisation,  since  when  is  it  a  matter  for  appar  ent  censure  to  be  financially  successful?  And  why  is  honesdy-acquired  finan  cial  clout,  such  as  it  is,  more  deserving  of  reproval  than  any  other  means  of  lobbying?   Yet  even  that  warrants  qualification.  Labor  and  the  Coalition  each  spend  approximately  $21  million  in  federal  elections;  of  that  amount,  about  $13m  for  each  party  derives  from  public  funding.  As  far  as  Labor  is  concerned,  half  of  the  rest  comes  from  the  unions;  which  leaves  about  $4m  from  private  donations.  Not  insignificant,  but  hardly  enough  to  turn  the  tide.   Last  November,  MP  Julia  Irwin  quoted  an  email  from  an  unidentified  source  who  warned  her  that  by  tackling  the  Jewish  community:  “You  have  taken  on  the  most  implacable,  arrogant,  cruel  and  powerful  lobby  in  the  country”,  warning  that  she  would  be  “singled  out  for  vilification  and,  if  pos  sible,  political  destruction”  The  slur  was  as  sensationalist  as  it  is  offensive.   There  are  times  when  the  Jewish  lobby  gets  it  wrong.  The  attempt  to  quash  Irwin’s  motion  attacking  Israel’s  occupation  of  the  West  Bank,  for  example,  was  ill-conceived,  and  it  was  legitimate  to  criticise  it  -  as  this  newspaper  did.   But  that  simply  means  the  Jewish  lobby  got  it  wrong  on  that  particular  occasion.  It  did  not,  and  does  not,  render  the  Jewish  lobby  an  “intimidating”  (as  Ramsey  has  described  it)  bogey,  intent  on  nefarious  objectives.   It  is  time  the  distinction  was  understood. ",2003-10-03
"  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  tour  guide  John  Weiner  with  visiting  students.   JACQU1  GAL   IN  March  this  year  the  monthly  number  of  students  visiting  the  Sydney  Museum  reached  a  four-year  high.  Steadily  increasing  over  April  and  May,  the  June  figure  was  the  highest  ever  recorded,  with  1730  students  passing  through  its  doors.   This  turnout  is  a  direct  result  of  the  muse   um's  efforts  to  address  a  gap  in  education.   Two  years  ago,  the  NSW  Department  of  Education  scrapped  parts  of  the  Year  10  his  tory  curriculum  which  examines  the  Holocaust  in  favour  of  a  more  parochial  per  spective.  Students  now  focus  instead  on  Australia's  involvement  in  World  War  II  and  there  is  no  guarantee  that  teachers  will  squeeze  in  a  unit  on  Holocaust  studies.   Museum  education  manager  Avril  Alba,  working  with  educational  consultant  Susie  Brieger  and  Roni  Bognar,  has  found  places  in  the  syllabus  where  possible  links  can  be  made,  however.   ""The  Year  12  English  syllabus  has  a  History  and  Memory  elective  that  explores  Mark  Baker's  book  The  50th  Gate,  and  the  Year  9  History  course  has  one  on  racism  and  genocide,""  Alba  explained.   ""What  better  way  to  address  these  issues  than  through  the  Holocaust?   ""We  tried  to  put  out  the  message  that  by  teaching  the  Holocaust  with  all  its  specificity  and  particularity,  it  would  illustrate  the  larger   universal  themes  of  racism.""   The  response  has  been  extraordinary.   Following  her  visit,  one  student  wrote:  ""I  am  inspired  by  your  strength  and  can  only  imagine  the  inhumane  violence  many  such  as  yourself  experienced  ...  It  was  through  your  experience,  shared  with  me,  that  I  under  stand  the  reality  of  it  all.   ""I  will  never  forget  your  strength  and  smile  and  never  ever  forget  your  story.  It  will  live  with  me  forever  and  I  pray  that  no-one  will  ever  let  the  disaster  of  the  Holocaust  happen  again.""   According  to  Alba  the  Holocaust  survivor   guides  are  the  most  powerful  educational  tool  the  museum  has.   ""It  comes  back  to  the  issues  of  specificity  and  particularity,  because  hearing  one  per  son's  story  helps  them  understand  how  many  stories  there  are.   ""It  personalises  the  number'six  million'  in  a  way  that  nothing  else  can.""   The  effect  on  the  students  is  unmistake   ably  profound.   Alba:  ""Seeing  the  impact  on  the  students  on  a  daily  basis  is  incredible.  Some  have   never  met  a  Jew  before.   “We  tried  to  put  out  the   message  that  by  teaching  the  Holocaust  with  all  its   specificity  and  particularity,  it  would  illustrate  the  larger   universal  themes  of  racism”   AVRILAIBA   Museum  education  manager   ""Recently,  a  group  came  from  a  rural  area.  [Survivor  guide]  Eddie  Jaku  went  in  with  them,  and  there  was  not  a  peep.  They  were  spellbound.  It's  an  intense  experience.   ""The  challenge  for  the  museum  is  how  to  continue  making  the  experience  as  powerful  when  this  generation  of  survivors  is  no  longer  here.""   On  August  11  the  museum  will  launch  new  school  materials,  developed  by  Sophie  Gelski,  to  help  provide  students  with  suffi  cient  preparation  and  follow-up  to  their  visit.   The  museum  is  also  developing  a  range  of  adult  education  programs.   Alba  is  working  in  association  with  Montefiore  Home  board  member  and   psychotherapist  Renee  Symonds  and  JewishCare  social  worker  Yael  Rottenberg  to  provide  training  for  staff  who  are  in  contact   with  Holocaust  survivors.

"  Maori  film  resonates  with  Jewish  themes   I   M   I  l   VIEWPOINT   DEBORAH  STONE   I  It's  Paikea  meetYentl.   Whale  Rider  is  about  values  which  should   echo  in  Jewish  ears  -  finding  new  leaders  to  carry  on  traditions,   knowing  when  to  bend  and  when  to  stand  firm   YOU  cant  hear  a  whale  moan   from  inside  the  white  walls  of  the  Auckland  Hebrew  Congre  gation.   Only  an  occasional  foghorn  might  remind  Sabbath  worshippers  of  the  proximity  of  the  coast  on  this  sliver  of  land  straddling  two  harbours.   Perhaps  though,  had  we  been  more  attentive,  we  might  have  heard  the  cries  of  Paikea,  the  little  Maori  girl  who  re-ignites  tradition  in  the  award-winning  film  Whale  Rider.   Paikea  is  the  descendant  of  chiefs,  but  she  is  not  the  heir  her  grandfa  ther  wanted  -  a  boy  who  would  grow  up  to  lead  their  people.   The  film  is  the  story  of  how  she  weaves  for  herself  that  mantle  of  leadership,  embracing  the  tribal  totem  of  the  whale,  breaking  the  male-dominated  tradition  to  make  it  live  again.   Paikea  is  fictional,  of  course,  but  she  need  not  be.   Little  girls  told  they  cannot  breach  the  tapu  (sacredness)  of  the  marae  (community  gathering  place)  by  arrogating  for  themselves  the  tradi  tions  of  their  fathers  are  just  the  same  as  litde  girls  told  they  cannot  breach  the  kedusha  (sanctity)  of  the  syna  gogue  by  reading  Torah.   It’s  Paikea  meet  Yentl.  The  girl  who  pretended  to  be  a  yeshiva  bocher  in  the  Isaac  Bashevis  Singer  story  made  into  a  Barbra  Streisand  film  was  seeking  her  own  intellectual  and  spiritual  fulfillment,  not  planning  to  change  the  world.   But  the  women  and  men  of  any  community  who  are  prepared  to  engage  with  their  heavy  inheritance  are  valuable  indeed,  especially  in  a  world  which  so  emphasises  the  mate   Paikea,  like  Yentl  in  Isaac  Bashevis  Singer’s  famous  book,  managed  to  change  an  ancient  male-dominated  Maori  custom.   rial  and  the  present  that  it  thinks  her  itage  is  a  range  of  paint  colours.   Communities  which  refuse  the  leadership  of  women  even  as  they  cry  out  desperately  for  leaders  are  not  culturally  specific.  Communities  which  refuse  to  change  anything  even  as  they  bemoan  the  loss  of  everything  are  equally  blind  the  world  over.   Whale  Rider  has  succeeded  with  audiences  not  just  because  the  cine  matography  is  amazing  or  the  per  formances  accomplished.  Clearly,  the  sustenance  of  a  small  but  proud  cul  ture  resonates  far  beyond  the  New  Zealand  coastline.   The  film  is  about  values  which   should  echo  loudly  in  Jewish  ears  -  finding  new  leaders  to  carry  on  old  traditions,  knowing  when  to  bend  and  when  to  stand  firm,  understand  ing  that  sacredness  can  be  found  in  unexpected  places.   As  a  trainee  journalist  in  New  Zealand,  I  met  a  young  activist  named  Tanaki  Stevens  who  talked  about  the  insidiousness  of  racism.  He  hated  Irish  jokes.   He  told  us  of  his  vision  for  cultur   al  respect  and  quoted  Yeats  -  a  bright  Irishman:  “I  spread  my  dreams  before  your  feet/Tread  carefully  for  you  tread  upon  my  dreams.”   I’ve  never  forgotten  that  talk.   Young,  proud  and  aware  of  the  dual  '  burden  and  gift  of  his  tradition,  he   connected  not  with  the  detached   journalist  in  me,  but  with  the  pas  sionate  Jew.   In  the  final  scene  of  Whale  Rider,  Paikea,  now  a  young  chief,  rides  high  in  a  grand  carved  canoe,  her  young  voice  singing  the  old  chants  as  100   men  and  women  row.   I  too  want  to  ride  the  waves  of  cul   tural  change,  giving  new  power  to  old   traditions.

Douglas  appears  in  a  role  that  was  adapted  slightly  to  make  his  character,  Mitchell  Gromberg,  the  highly  suc  cessful  patriarch  of  a  Jewish  family.   Douglas  had  a  lot  to  do  with  getting  the  .film  made  in  the  first  place.  Although  he  has  appeared  in  86  movies  in  his  long  career  and  won  three  Oscars,  he  had  never  made  a  movie  with  his  highly  successful  actor  producer  son  Michael,  although  they  have  been  trying  for  more  than  20   years.   After  September  11  they  decided  to  work  harder  to  find  a  film  in  which   they  could  both  appear.  Around  the  same  time  a  young  screenwriter,  Jesse  Wigutow,  submitted  a  script  to  Michael  Douglas  that  eventually  became  It  Runs  In  The  Family,  which  is  directed  by  Australian  film-maker  Fred  Schepisi.   Cameron  Douglas,  the  24-year-old  son  of  Michael  Douglas  and  his  first  wife,  was  not  an  actor,  but  took  acting  lessons  and  won  the  role  of  the  third  generation  Asher  Gromberg.   It  Runs  In  The  Family  is  a  warm  hearted  comedy/drama  about  a  mildly  dysfunctional  upscale  New  York  Jew   ish  dan.   Mitchell  Gromberg  is  a  highly-suc  cessful  retired  attorney  who  is  not  so  successful  when  it  comes  to  communi  cating  with  his  family.   His  son,  Alex  (Michael  Douglas)  is  also  a  high-powered  lawyer  who  works  for  the  family  firm.   Even  as  he  chides  his  father  for  his  coldness  and  lack  of  communication,  his  own  relationships  with  his  wife   Hie  cast  of  It  Runs  In  The  Family  from  top  left  Michael  Douglas,  Bernadette  Peters,  Diana  Douglas,  Kirk  Douglas,  Cameron  Douglas  and  Rory  Culkin.   (Bernadette  Peters)  and  two  sons  (Cameron  Douglas  and  Rory  Culkin)   leave  much  to  be  desired.   The  generational  tangle  begins  to  come  undone  at  the  family  seder  and  threatens  to  unravel  completely.   Douglas  was  born  Issur  Danielovitch,  the  son  of  illiterate,  poverty-stricken  Russian-Jewish  immigrants  in  New  York.   He  worked  his  way  through  college  as  a  wrestler  and  eventually  won  a  scholarship  to  the  American  Academy  of  Dramatic  Arts,  a  move  that  launched  his  career  on  Broadway.   “Studying  the  Torah  is   very  demanding.  I  say  to  screenwriters,  You  want  to  write?  Study  the  Torah.”'   KIRK  DOUGLAS   Veteran  actor   He  won  Oscars  for  best  actor  in  1950  for  Champion  and  in  1953  for  The  Bad  And  The  Beautiful  In  1996,  he  received  an  honorary  Oscar  for  50  years’  work  in  the  industry.   For  much  of  his  life  he  did  not   practise  Judaism.  It  was  after  a  helicop  ter  crash  in  1991  that  Douglas  began  finding  his  way  back  to  Judaism.   “I  was  in  the  hospital,  with  my  back  almost  broken,”  he  said.  “It  made  me  think  more  about  my  life.”   He  began  studying  with  Rabbi  David  Aaron,  a  Jerusalem  Orthodox  rabbi,  whose  Israelight  Institute  spe  cialises  in  teaching  Judaism  to  adults.  Since  then,  he  says,  he  has  also  worked  with  a  number  of  other  rabbis.   “I  have  worked  through  the  Torah  twice  and  I  am  still  studying  it  because   it  fascinates  me.   “Studying  the  Torah  is  very  demanding.  I  say  to  screenwriters,  ‘You  want  to  write?  Study  the  Torah.’  There  is  every  story,  every  plot  that  you  can  think  of  in  there,  and  it  is  very  dramatic.”   CHICAGO  JEWISH  NEWS   It  Runs  In  The  Family  is  scheduled  to  be   released  in  Australia  in  August.

"  Inside  the  mind  of  a  Jewish  cartoonist   Angle  Fox   IT  might  sound  like  a  droll  pick-up  |  line,  but  the  title  of  Andrew  Weldon’s  |  first  collection  of  cartoons,  I’m  So   Sorry  Little  Man,  I  Thought  You  Were  |  A  Hand-Puppet,  is  in  fact  the  punch   |  line  of  one  of  his  more  subversive  |  works.   |  It  certainly  sets  the  tone  for  this  |  new  book  of  Weldon’s  250  best  car  |  toons,  works  that  are  renowned  for  ji  being  dark,  witty  and,  at  times,  |  inane.   |  “A  lot  of  humour  ...  is  derived  I  from  taboo  subjects,”  he  told  the  |  Australian  Jewish  News.   |  “I  find  a  lot  of  my  humour  in  play  |  ing  around  with  those  subjects  that   f  make  people  a  bit  uncomfortable.”   ;  Weldon,  31,  grew  up  in  Mount  ;  Eliza,  studied  at  Woodleigh  High  I  School  in  Baxter  and  had  his  bar  \  mitzvah  at  Bentleigh  Progressive  \  Synagogue.   |  He  began  writing  and  illustrating  j  cartoons  for  his  own  amusement   ;  while  studying  architecture  at  the   University  of  Melbourne  and  writing  \  and  performing  in  the  infamous  ;  architecture  reviews  that  helped  |  launch  the  careers  of  Rob  Sitch  !  (Frontline  and  Santo  Cilauro.   !  He  was  first  published  in  the  uni  |  versity’s  student  newspaper,  |  Farrago,  and  his  work  appeared  in   I  the  Bulletin  and  Good  Weekend  mag  \  azine  while  he  was  still  a  student.   |  Although  he  completed  the  six   year  architecture  degree  in  1995,  he  has  never  worked  as  an  architect,  instead  freelancing  as  a  cartoonist  for  almost  10  years.   “Cartoons  can  take  minutes  or  hours,  depending  on  how  my  brain  is  working,”  he  says.  “Coming  up   Andrew  Weldon   with  the  ideas  is  the  hard  part.”   As  well  as  being  a  regular  contrib  utor  to  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald,  Weldon’s  cartoons  have  appeared  in  the  Australian  and  Age]  in  magazines  including  the  Big  Issue,  HQ  and  GQ;  and  on  The  Ink  Group’s  greeting   cards.   He  has  also  written  and  illus  trated  two  children’s  books,  The  Kid  With  the  Amazing  Head  and  Clever  Trevor’s  Stupendous  Invention,  and  is  planning  to  write  a  third  instalment.   Weldon  says  his  work  is  inspired  by  the  “Jewish-flavoured”  humour  of  Woody  Allen  and  Tom  Lehrer,  a  musician  and  satirist  who  worked  in   One  of  Andrew  Weldon's  Jewlslt-lnsplred  cartoons.   the  1950s  and  ‘60s.  He  is  also  a  fan  of  the  Marx  Brothers.   “There’s  that  really  strong  tradi  tion  of  Jewish  humour  that  I’ve  been  exposed  to.  I’ve  always  loved  that  sort  of  humour.  I  think  there  are   traces  of  that  in  my  work.”   His  work,  he  says,  has  been  influ  enced  by  the  distinctive  style  of  the  New  Yorker  magazine  cartoonists  as  well  as  The  Simpsons  creator  Matt  Groening.   He  also  cites  Age  cartoonist  Michael  Leunig  as  an  inspiration  and  doesn’t  believe  that  the  latter’s  con  troversial  Holocaust  cartoon  that   was  pulled  from  the  Age  last  year  was  intentionally  anti-Israel.   “I  thought  the  point  Leunig  was  trying  to  make  was  valid  —  that  the  cycle  of  war  in  the  Middle  East  bene  fits  no-one;  that  the  claim  that  peace  can  be  achieved  by  continuing  the  cycle  of  violence  is  a  cruel  lie.   “However,  I  thought  the  way  he  expressed  the  idea  was  unfortunate  because  it  used  elements  and  analo  gies  that  were  clearly  hurtful  to  many  people.”   While  the  250  works  in  I’m  So  Sorry  Little  Man,  I  Thought  You  Were  A  Hand-Puppet,  chosen  from  over  800  of  his  cartoons,  are  social  com  mentaries,  jokes  and  observations  about  life,  Weldon  is  also  a  political   cartoonist.   Although  he  is  happy  to  “vent  his  spleen”  about  the  “so-called  war  on  terror”  and  the  Howard  govern  ment’s  policies  on  refugees,  deten  tion  centres  and  border  protection,  he  is  reluctant  to  satirise  the  situa  tion  in  the  Middle  East.   “You  can  be  quite  objective  about  a  lot  of  issues,  but  all  that  stuff  sur  rounding  Israel,  as  a  Jew,  it’s  very  hard  to  view  that  objectively  as  a  commentator,”  he  says,  noting  that  he  has  drawn  a  few  political  car   toons  about  Israel.   “I  try  to  look  at  the  people  who  are  affected  by  the  pain  and  horror  on  a  smaller  scale,  as  opposed  to  actually  trying  to  solve  the  problems  of  the  world  as  a  cartoonist.  It’s  good  to  have  a  forum  where  you  can,  through  satire,  argue  for  a  bit  more  humanity.   The  greatest  challenge  in  political  cartooning,  according  to  Weldon,  is  in  conveying  a  message  succinctly.  “The  best  cartoons  pack  their  punch  in  a  really  minimal  way.”   ■  I’m  So  Sorry  Little  Man,  I  Thought  You  Were  A  Hand-Puppet  is  published  by  Allen  &amp;  Unwin.

"  Jewish,  Muslim  photographers  have  common  brotherhood  in  focus   A  JEWISH  photographer  and   an  Iranian-born  Muslim   photographer  have  combined  their  talents  to  produce  an  exhibition  designed  to  convey   the  brotherhood  of  Man  and   the  commonality  of  people.   Brotherhood  of  the  Grapes:  Duet  #1  is  the  title  of  a  joint  photographic  exhibition  which  has  opened  at  the  Sherman  Galleries  by  Homi   Vesal  and  Paul  Green.   Working  in  a  spirit  of  close  co-operation,  Vesal  and  Green  have  ventured  into  the   complex  theme  of  religion  -  most  significantly,  their  own  religions  and  backgrounds;   Vesal  is  an  Iranian-born  Mus  lim  and  Green  the  Sydney  born  Jew.   “We  have  reduced  the  images  to  their  most  basic  elements,”  Green  said  -  “the  Jew  on  one  side,  the  Muslim  on  the  other.   Only  their  backs  and  the   backs  of  their  heads  can  be   seen  as  they  face  a  grey  void.   “They  are,  of  course,  the  same  person;  only  the  detail  in  the  embroidery  of  the  skull  cap  sets  them  apart.   With  this  very  simple  duet,  we  see  the  similarities,  the  differences,  and  try  to  expose  the  spirit  of  brother   hood  that  exists  between  all  humans”   This  is  the  second  large  scale  series  of  photographic   works  on  which  Green  and  Vesal  have  collaborated  since   jo  da  in  2001.

"  Jewish  Museum  breaks  taboo  to  support  gay  festival   PeterKdin   THE  Jewish  Museum  of  Australia  is  breaking  a  community  taboo  with  its  first-ever  involvement  in  Midsumma  —  Melbourne’s  annual  Gay  and  Lesbian  Festival—through  an  exhibi  tion  of  paintings  by  gay  Jewish  artist   Sam  Schoenbaum.   Strangers  and  Sojourners,  an  exhi   bition  dedicated  to  what  museum  director  Dr  Helen  Light  calls  “the  mar  ginalised  in  our  community”,  focuses  on  the  works  of  Schoenbaum,  who  calls  himself  “the  wandering  Jew”.   Schoenbaum,  a  gay  Jewish   Australian,  does  not  live  at  a  fixed  address  and  travels  the  world  to  work  and  be  inspired.   His  abstract  paintings  express  his  itinerant  lifestyle  —  and  his  latest  offerings  will  be  featured  in  the  exhi  bition  at  the  Jewish  Museum’s  Gross  Gallery  as  part  of  the  La  Trobe  University  exhibition  program.   A  series  of  stark  monochromes  and  a  large-scale  canvas  depicting  persecution  of  homosexuals  and  Jews  during  the  Holocaust  are  the  focus  of  the  exhibition,  which  will  run  from  January  21  to  February  9.   Dr  Light  said  the  museum  decided   to  support  the  Midsumma  Festival  and  came  up  with  an  exhibition  of  Schoenbaum’s  works  curated  by  Eugene  Barilo  von  Reisberg,  manager  of  the  Charles  Nodrum  gallery.   “Sam  is  a  really  good  artist;  we  have  a  work  of  his  in  our  collection  and  have  shown  his  work  before.”   The  museum  anticipated  contro  versial  reactions  from  sections  of  the  community  over  its  involvement  with  a  gay  festival,  but  it  had  to  reflect  the  diversity  of  the  community,  Dr  Light  said.  “It’s  our  brief  to  reflect  our  com  munity,  so  if  there’s  a  group  that  feels  they  wish  to  identify,  it’s  not  our  busi  ness  to  reject  them.   “We’re  not  a  synagogue,  we’re  not  allied  with  any  religious  organisation  and  we’re  not  condoning  homosexu  ality.  What  we’re  doing  is  embracing  those  who  wish  to  identify  as  Jews.”   She  said  this  diversity  needs  to  be  relayed  to  the  general  community  with  the  message  that  “this  is  how  we  live  in  this  country”.   Moreover,  the  exhibition  is  not  about  homosexuality,  but  about  alienation  and  the  stranger  in  our  midst,  she  emphasised.   The  exhibition  has  aroused  main  stream  interest,  with  the  Age  featur  ing  an  article  on  Schoenbaum  and  citing  the  halachic  prohibition  against  homosexuality.   The  newspaper  reported  Yeshivah  Rabbi  Yitzchok  Groner  as   opposing  the  exhibition,  while  St  Kilda  Congregation  Rabbi  Philip  Heilbrunn  emphasised  the  independ  ence  of  the  museum.   Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victoria  president  Grahame  Leonard  said  he  was  sure  the  museum’s  involvement  with  a  gay  arts  festival  would  create  controversy.   “But  the  Jewish  Museum  sees   Artist  Sam  Schoenbaum,  whose  works  depicting  persecution  of  homosexuals  and  Jews  during  the  Holocaust  are  the  focus  of  his  exhibition  at  the  Melbourne  Jewish  Museum  as  part  of  the  Mldsumma  Festival.   itself  representing  all  aspects  of  Jewish  communal  life,  not  just  the  Orthodox  religious  view,  and  in  that  sense  it  is  fulfilling  its  charter.   “The  museum  is  not  formally  speaking  on  behalf  of  the  Jewish  com  munity,  but  is  representing  its  diver  sity  to  the  wider  community.   “Art  is  often  controversial,  and  with  so  many  members  of  the  Jewish  community  being  knowledgeable  in  the  arts  and  patrons  of  the  arts,  there  should  be  a  degree  of  tolerance.”   Convener  of  Jewish  gay  rights  group  Aleph  Melbourne,  Michael  Barnett,  said  the  museum’s  collabo  ration  was  significant.   The  museum  is  “collaborating  with  a  gay  organisation,  knowingly  promoting  the  work  of  gay  Jews,  exhibiting  art  with  a  homosexual  theme  and  endorsing  an  activity  or   lifestyle  prohibited  under  halacha  .   “The  real  issue  is  that  Orthodox  Judaism  is  intolerant  of  non-hetero  sexual  lifestyles.  All  the  while,  it  turns  a  blind  eye  to  a  myriad  of  other  infrac  tions  of  halacha.  Until  that  attitude  softens,  I  will  not  be  surprised  by  its  negative  reaction  to  homosexuality.  I  will  also  continue  to  fight  against  the  intolerance,  hatred  and  denial  it  espouses  toward  homosexuality.”   Schoenbaum  was  born  in  1947  in  a  displaced  persons  camp  in  Austria  and  arrived  in  Melbourne  in  1951.   He  has  exhibited  in  Melbourne,   Sydney,  Adelaide,  Amsterdam,  Venice,  New  York,  Maastricht  and   San  Francisco.   The  exhibition  will  be  opened  by  Victorian  Supreme  Court  Justice   Howard  Nathan. ",2003-01-17
"  Immigrate  to  Israel,  urges  Moroccan  Jewish  leader   JERUSALEM  -  The  president  of  the  Federation  of  Moroccan  Jews,  Sam  Ben-Sheetrit,  sent  a  message  to  Morocco’s  king  expressing  the  hope  that  Morocco  would  clamp  down  “with  an  iron  fist”  on  Islamic  extrem   ists  inside  the  country,  which  threaten  Moroccan  stability.   Ben-Sheetrit  also  called  on   Morocco’s  Jews  to  immigrate  to  Israel  as  soon  as  they  could.   Ben-Sheetrit  said  that  there  was  a   “negative  atmosphere”  towards  Jews  in  Morocco,  Army  Radio  reported.

"  Iran’s  only  Jewish  MP  visits  Australia   DAN  GOLDBERG   THE  only  Jewish  member  of  the  Iran  ian  majlis  (parliament)  visited  Mel  bourne  this  week  as  part  of  an  inter-parliamentary  delegation.   Morris  Mottamed,  vice-chairman  of  the  Iranian-Australian  Parliamen   tary  Friendship  Group,  said  he  had  spent  70  per  cent  of  his  time  and  ener  gy  helping  the  “Iran  13”,  who  were  imprisoned  in  1999  on  trumped-up  charges  of  spying  for  Israel.   The  last  of  the  13,  most  of  them  religious  leaders  from  Shiraz,  were  released  earlier  this  year.   Their  advocates  -  as  well  as  media,  diplomats  and  human  rights  experts  from  around  the  world  -  had  pro  nounced  the  closed  trial  a  fraud;  Israel   denied  that  the  men  spied  for  it.   Speaking  through  an  interpreter,  Mottamed,  who  has  one  year  left  of  his  four-year  term,  said  the  Iranian  Jewish  community  did  not  suffer  adversely  as  a  result  of  the  trial.   Iran’s  Jewish  community  is  one  of  five  officially-recognised  minorities  -  the  others  being  the  Zoroastrians,  Assyrians,  Chaldean  and  Armenian  Christians  -  which  each  hold  seats  in  the  290-member  parliament.   Iranian  Jewry  numbered  100,000  before  the  1979  Islamic  Revolution;  today  there  are  about  25,000,  mainly  in  Teheran  (12,000)  and  Shiraz  (6000).

"  Letters   Being  Jewish  on  Australia  Day   AUSTRALIA  Day,  like  any  national  independence  day,  is  a  time  for   reflecting  on  the  past  and  considering  the  future.  It  is  also  a  time  for  celebrating  the  present.   According  to  the  2001  Census,  Australian  Jewry  comprises  83,993  peo  ple,  a  mere  0.4  per  cent  of  the  population  (although  the  real  figure  is  believed  to  be  closer  to  110,000,  with  many  declining  to  identify  on  the  Cen  sus  as  Jewish).   And  yet  the  community’s  contribution  across  the  full  spectrum  of  soci  ety  —  the  arts,  sciences,  business,  military  technology  and  many  other   fields  —  far  exceeds  our  number.   This  year,  as  in  previous  years,  members  of  the  Jewish  community  have  been  honoured  in  the  Australia  Day  awards,  both  for  their  contribution  to  the  Jewish  and  the  general  communities.  Among  this  year’s  most  distin  guished  recipients  are  Dr  David  Cooper  and  Melbourne’s  Professor  Doreen  Rosenthal,  both  of  whom  have  been  acknowledged  for  their  contribution  to  HIV/AIDS  research.   Yet  while  we  celebrate  our  good  fortune  in  being  citizens  of  this  largely  tolerant,  modem,  multicultural  society,  we  should  reflect  also  on  unre  solved  issues  that  are  close  to  the  hearts  of  most  Australian  Jews.   It  is  part  of  the  history  which  shaped  our  community  that  thousands  of  Jews  arrived  here  from  Europe  on  boats,  seeking  refuge  from  what  became  the  darkest  chapter  in  our  history.   It  is  that  history,  that  memory,  that  stain  of  genocide,  infused  with  the  quest  for  a  humane  approach  to  the  less  fortunate,  which  has  informed  this  community’s  opposition  to  the  government’s  policy  on  asylum-seekers.   As  a  community  whose  foundations  were  partially  laid  by  refugees  and  their  descendants,  it  follows  that  we  should  be  empathetic  to  the  plight  of  bona  fide  asylum-seekers,  especially  children,  most  of  whom  land  on  our  shores  only  to  be  locked  behind  razor-wire  fences  in  the  blazing  desert.   Equally,  while  the  ties  between  the  Jewish  and  Aboriginal  communities  remain  strong,  the  plight  of  indigenous  Australians  has  virtually  disap  peared  from  the  political  map.   While  there  are  clear  and  distinct  differences,  Australia  Day  is  in  many  ways  to  the  Aboriginals  what  Yom  Ha’atzmaut  is  to  the  Palestinians.  For  both  peoples,  our  celebration  is  a  reminder  of  their  dispossession.   As  such,  it  is  vital  that  our  community  —  members  of  whom  helped  spearhead  the  historic  Native  Title  legislation  —  should  continue  to  advo  cate  for  Aboriginal  reconciliation  to  ensure  that  the  issue  is  not  buried  beneath  the  political  agenda  of  the  day,  but  is  aired  and  resolved.   Clearly,  Australia  2003  is  a  different  country  from  one  year  ago.  The  Bali  bombings,  which  killed  88  Australians,  has  brought  the  spectre  of  terror  to  our  doorstep.   What  happened  on  October  12,  2002  shattered  the  myth  of  Australian  innocence,  a  naivete  bom  from  our  so-called  tyranny  of  distance.  Bali  replaced  that  tyranny  of  distance  in  the  Australian  lexicon  with  a  tyranny   of  terror.   And  now  the  looming  war  on  Iraq—and  Australia’s  involvement  in  it—  will  undoubtedly  divide  loyalties  as  Australia’s  support  for  a  US-led  strike  on  Saddam  Hussein  places  this  continent  on  the  terrorists’  radar.   Nevertheless,  we  are  fortunate  indeed  to  live  in  this  land  of  plenty.  Whereas  Jews  in  Europe  are  debating  the  resurgence  of  a  “new  anti  semitism”  that  appears  to  have  reared  its  head;  whereas  the  Argentinian  community  is  wondering  how  it  will  feed  its  members;  whereas  Israeli  Jews  are  worrying  where  the  next  terror  attack  will  strike,  Australian  Jews  enjoy  a  stable  environment  relatively  removed  from  such  dire  scenarios.   Despite  the  threat  of  terrorism,  the  bushfires  and  the  drought  that  plague  our  country,  and  despite  the  unprecedented  upsurge  in  antisemitic  attacks  here,  we  are  free  to  practise  our  religion  and  have  a  government  which  unabashedly  supports  the  right  of  Israel  to  exist.   As  we  celebrate  Australia  Day  this  week,  we  should  consider  ourselves  lucky  indeed  to  live  in  what  is  a  “lucky  country”. ",2003-01-31
"  Definitive  history  of  Jewish  Shanghai   BOOK  REVIEW   SOLENCEL   PORT  OF  LAST  RESORT:  THE   DIASPORA  COMMUNITIES  OF  SHANGHAI   Marcia  Reynders  Ristaino   Stanford  University  Press,  2002,369  pages,  $60   THE  story  of  the  Jewish  communities  0  -  of  Shanghai  and  their  difficult  exis   tence  under  Japanese  occupation  has  been  told  many  times.   This  book,  however,  fills  in  all  the  gaps  and  must  surely  be  the  definitive  work  on  the  subject.   Marcia  Ristaino,  an  American  scholar  who  is  an  expert  on  the  histo  ry  of  Chinese  communism,  has  read  and  digested  an  enormous  amount  of  material  including  the  archives  of  the  World  Jewish  Congress,  the  League  of  Nations,  the  US  State  Department  '  and  the  Shanghai  municipality.  She   also  interviewed  a  number  of  former   Shanghai  residents,  mainly  in  the   United  States.   The  result  is  a  detailed  account  of  the  lives  and  times  of  the  two  main   refugee  groups  -  Jewish  and  Russian  Orthodox  -  who  contributed  to  the  unique  diversity  of  Shanghai  society   between  1918  and  1945.   At  their  peak  in  the  1930s,  the  two  groups  totalled  more  than  50,000  people.   The  Jewish  presence  in  Shanghai  began  early,  following  the  declaration  of  the  city  as  a  treaty  port  in  1840  after  the  opium  wars,  which  forced  the  imperial  Chinese  Government  to  grant  extra-territorial  privileges  to  foreign  powers,  principally  the  British,  French  and  Americans.   By  1918,  the  total  Jewish  popula  tion  was  about  2000,  with  roughly  equal  numbers  of  Sephardim  and   Ashkenazim.  It  was  then  augmented  by  successive  waves  of  refugees.   The  defeat  of  the  “white”  armies  in  the  civil  war  following  the  Russian  Revolution  brought  thousands  of  ex  soldiers  and  civilian  refugees.   Their  plight  was  made  even  more  difficult  by  the  Soviet  decree  of  1921  which  deprived  Russians  living  abroad  of  their  citizenship.   A  trickle  of  Jews  from  Eastern  Europe   continued  during  the   1920s  and  1930s,  but  was  overtaken  by  a  new  wave  of  refugees  from  I  Nazism.   The  early  Jewish  migrants  includ  ed  former  soldiers  and  refugees  from  the  pogroms  which  accompanied  the  civil  war.  A  trickle  of  Jews  from  East  ern  Europe  continued  during  the   1920s  and  1930s,  but  was  overtaken  by  a  new  wave  of  refugees  from  Nazism,  which  peaked  in  1939  when  12,000  people  arrived.   Most  of  the  refugees  settled  in  the  Hongkou  area  in  the  northern  part  of  the  city,  which  became  known  as  Jew  ish  Town.  During  the  Japanese  occu  pation,  it  became  a  virtual   internment  camp.   The  last  wave  of  refugees  arrived  from  Eastern  Europe  in  1940-41,  many  of  them  with  visas  issued  by  the  Japanese  consul  in  Lithuania,  Chiune  Sugihara.   Ristaino’s  version  of  Sugihara  dif  fers  from  the  generally  accepted  account  of  his  actions  which  earned  him  the  title  of  Righteous  Among  the  Nations,  saying  that  he  was  following  Japanese  government  policy.   Two  of  the  numerous  stories  told   by  Ristaino  have  overtones  which  still  resonate  today.  She  describes  the  infighting  between  two  of  the  aid  committees  in  Shanghai,  representing  East  European  and  Central  European  refugees.   In  one  case,  the  East  European  committee  refused  to  assist  the  chil  dren  of  destitute  German  and  Austri  an  parents,  arguing  that  it  was  more  important  to  provide  kosher  facilities  for  the  Orthodox  Jews  from  Poland  and  Lithuania.   Ristaino  also  describes  the  luke  warm  attitude  of  the  Australian  Gov  ernment  towards  the  refugees.   The  Australian  consul-general  in  Shanghai  claimed  that  Shanghai  Jews  were  unsuitable  migrants  because   some  of  them  were  involved  in  crim  inal  activities.  In  the  end,  only  about  2000  Jews  arrived  between  1945  and  1953.  Has  anything  changed?   Sol  Encel  is  professor  emeritus  of  sociology  at  the  University  of  NSW. ",2003-03-21
"  Enlightened  officer  allowed  Jewish  convicts  to  pray  THE  convicts  who  were  sent   to  Norfolk  Island  suffered  terribly,  particularly  during  the  second  settlement  (1825-1855),  when  they  were  flogged  and  even  hanged  for  spurious  offences,  usually   at  the  whim  of  an  officer.   However,  one  man  was  ahead  of  his  time  -  an  enlightened  officer  who  regarded  the  penal  colony  as  a  place  of  rehabilitation,  not  retribution.   Appointed  superintendent  of   Norfolk  in  1840,  Alexander  Maconochie  introduced  a  merit  sys-  tem  whereby  convicts  would  be  granted  freedom  if  they  were  indus-   trious  and  well-behaved.   He  pulled  down  the  gallows,  abol-  ished  flogging  and  let  the  prisoners  free  on  Sundays  to  attend  church,  cul-  tivate  plots  and  rear  poultry.   He  was  also  remarkably  tolerant  on  religious  matters.  He  wrote  in  his  diary:  “I  authorised  14  Jews,  who  were   deplorably  demoralised,  to  meet  for  worship  in  a  room  I  assigned  them.   “With  the  Jews,  unused  to  having  their  faith  treated  with  respect,  I  was  particularly  successful.  I  made  one  of  their  number  their  reader  and  gave  him  charge  over  moral  conduct  as  well  as  religious  observances.   “They  all  behaved  well.  Three  became  overseers.  One  has  resettled  in  Sydney  and  one,  originally  among  the  least  promising,  established  a  busi-   ness.  He  had  been  12  years  a  prisoner.”   Maconochie’s  treatment  of  Jews  “was  very  much  to  his  credit"",  wrote  historian  John  Barry.   ""He  obtained  from  the  chief  rabbi  of  Sydney  vestments  and  books,  with  advice  as  to  what  to  do  to  enable  reli-  gious  practices  to  be  fostered.  The  experiment  was  successful  and  all  became  reformed  characters.”   Maconochie  was  recalled  to  Eng-  land  in  disgrace  in  1844. ",2003-10-03
"  Sex  and  The  City  and  the  Jewish  wedding   SHOSHANA  LEWIN   IDS  ANGELES  -  A  show  with  four   Manhattan  women  who  spend  most  of  their  time  talking  about  men,  food  and  shopping  -  and  none  of  them  Jewish?   That  could  change  when  one  of  the  stars  of  Sex  and  The  City  considers  converting  to  Judaism.   In  the  beginning  of  season  five,  WASP  Charlotte  York  (Kirsten  Davis)  got  back  into  the  dating  game  after  her   divorce  from  handsome  mamma’s   boy  Dr  Trey  MacDougaL  By  the  end  of  the  season,  she  found  herself  in  love  with  divorce  lawyer  Harry  Golden  blatt  (Evan  Handler).   After  the  divorce,  Charlotte  pro  claimed  her  love  to  Harry.  He  felt  the  same,  he  said  -but  could  never  marry  her  because  she  isn’t  Jewish.   Charlotte’s  plot  in  the  show’s  sixth   and  final  season  will  therefore  focus   on  her  contemplating  converting  to  Judaism.  Rabbi  Minsch  (Pierre  Epstein)  will  make  an  appearance  in  the  second  episode.   “She  has  to  try  to  understand  why  it’s  important  to  him  that  he  marry  a  Jew  -  she’s  hoping  it’s  negotiable-  and  whether  she  loves  him  enough  to  con  vert  for  him,”  said  Cindy  Chupack,  writer  and  co-executive  producer.   Chupack,  who  is  Jewish,  said  Char  lotte  was  more  suited  to  this  storyline  than  her  friends:  Carrie  (Sarah  Jessica  Parker),  Miranda  (Cynthia  Nixon)  or  Samantha  (Kim  Catrall).   “Charlotte  always  had  the  most  fairytale  vision  of  love.

"  Cocaine  bust  snares   German  Jewish  leader   Under  fire:  German  Jewish  leader  Michel  Friedman.   Photo:  Joel  Rubinfeld   TOBY  AXELROD   BERLIN  -  German  authorities  have  confirmed  that  cocaine  was  found  in  the  possession  of  Michel  Friedman,  vice-president  of  the  Central  Council  of  Jews  in  Germany.   Officials  in  Frankfurt  had  found  a  white  powdery  substance  after  searching  Friedman’s  home  and  law  office  on  June  11.  A  day  later,  they  confirmed  that  the  substance  was  cocaine.   The  search  was  prompted  by  the  emergence  of  Friedman’s  name  during  an  ongoing  investigation  of  a  Ukrainian  crime  ring  involving  slavery,  prostitution  and  the  smug  gling  of  drugs  and  weapons  into  Ger  many.  Prosecutors  stressed  that  Friedman,  also  the  president  of  the  European  Jewish  Congress,  is  not  sus  pected  of  involvement  in  this  ring.   According  to  a  June  14  report  in  Focus  Magazine,  authorities  are  also  looking  into  whether  Friedman  encouraged  prostitutes  to  use  the  drug.  Penalty  for  possession  of  illegal  narcotics  in  Germany  ranges  from  a  fine  to  up  to  five  years  in  prison.   German  media  quickly  picked  up  and  highlighted  the  story,  which  involves  one  of  the  best-known  and  most  controversial  Jewish  public  figures  in  Germany.  Some  media  outlets  used  old  photos  of  Friedman  smiling  broadly  and  receiving  Germany’s  highest  medal  of  honour  to  illustrate  the  seamy  news.   A  well-known  personality  and  TV  talk-show  host  in  Germany,  Friedman  is  known  as  an  effective   speaker  against  racism  and  antisemitism,  and  as  an  outspoken  supporter  of  Israel.  He  has  not  commented  on  the  investigation.   After  news  of  the  probe  for  possible  narcotics  possession  broke  on  June  11,  Friedman  suspended  production  of  his  TV  talk  shows,  Friedman  and  Watch  Out!  Friedman.  His  attorney  told  reporters  it  is  too  early  for  a  statement.   During  the  search,  samples  of   Friedman’s  hair  were  taken  in  for  test   ing;  results  may  not  be  available  for  several  days.  Friedman  reportedly  co  operated  with  investigators.   As  news  of  the  inquiry  unfolded  last  Friday,  Paul  Spiegel,  president  of  the  Central  Councilof  Jews,  defended  Friedman  and  insisted  that  he  not  be  judged  outside  a  court  of  law.  Spiegel  told  the  Berliner  Tagesspiegel  he  saw  no  reason  for  Friedman  to  step  down  from  his  post  on  the  council.   Salomon  Korn,  head  of  the  Jewish  community  in  Frankfurt,  said  before  the  substance  was  confirmed  as  cocaine  that  it  is  absolutely  out  of  Friedman’s  character  to  be  involved  with  drugs.  He  told  the  internet  news  agency  Netzeitung  that  Friedman   does  not  smoke  or  drink  alcohol.  He  suggested  that  “an  envious  person  was  using  the  opportunity  to  even  an   old  score”.   JTA ",2003-06-20
"  A  forum  for  shared  Jewish,  Labor  values   ALLONLEE   THE  reforming  instincts  of  social  democratic  parties  such  as  the  Aus  tralian  Labor  Party  descend  from  the  prophetic  tradition  in  Judaism.   This  was  Premier  Bob  Carr’s  mes  sage  to  the  inaugural  meeting  of  the  Jewish  Labor  Forum  in  Sydney  on  Tuesday  evening.   “Ancient  civilisations  like  China   and  Mesopotamia  didn’t  have  great  reformers  who  could  say  ‘our  society  is  corrupt,  it  needs  to  be  reformed’.”   The  reforming  trend  in  Judaism  was  so  powerful  “that  some  people   believe  all  reform  is  descended  from  it”.   Noting  that  his  own  career  had  been  shaped  by  Australian  Jews,  Carr  recalled  his  first  political  meeting  in  1965  at  the  University  of  NSW,  with  current  NSW  Supreme  Court  Chief  Justice  Jim  Spigelman  in  attendance.   Spigelman  had  organised  a  bus  trip  across  NSW  to  fight  for  Aboriginal  rights  -  Australia’s  version  of  the  US  civil  rights  movement’s  freedom  rides.   Carr’s  first  appointment  of  a  NSW  governor  was  Gordon  Samuels,  who  had  also  been  instrumental  in  fighting  discrimination  against  Aborigines.   ALP  figures  like  Syd  Einfeld  and   former  NSW  Environment  minister  Paul  Landa  were  role-models  for   many  people,  Carr  said,  describing  current  NSW  ALP  general  secretary  Eric  Roozendaal  as  the  “best  cam   paign  manager  Labor  has  ever  had”.   Councillor  Sam  Einfeld,  Jewish  Labor  Forum  co-founder  Robin  Shuck  and  Premier   Bob  Carr  at  the  inaugural  meeting  of  the  forum.  Photo:  Ingrid  Shakenovsky   Recalling  the  first  Labor  Friends  of  Israel  meeting  in  1977,  Carr  said  he  read  and  distributed  three  speeches  by  then-trade  union  president  Bob   Hawke  on  the  case  for  Israel.   The  simplicity  of  Hawke’s  argu  ments  were  so  compelling  that  he  still  recalled  them  25  years  later:  there  are  many  sovereign  Arab  states  but  only  one  Jewish  state;  Israel  was  estab  lished  by  international  law  by  a  Unit  ed  Nations  resolution;  Israel  has  an  independent  judiciary  and  a  multi  party  system  of  government.   Carr  described  himself  as  a   “guardian”  of  these  positions  at  many  Labor  conferences  over  the  years.   Established  to  promote  the  com  mon  goals  of  the  Jewish  community  and  Labor,  the  forum  will  promote   engagement  between  the  community  and  all  levels  of  the  party.   Founding  member  Sam  Einfeld  -  Syd  Einfeld’s  great-nephew  -  said  social  justice,  access  to  education,  health  services,  a  tolerant  and  multi  cultural  Australia  and  a  “fair  go  for  all”   were  the  common  values  which  Labor   and  the  Jewish  community  shared.   “Jews  have  been  historically  close  to  Labor,”  he  said.   People  wanting  to  see  meaningful  change  need  to  get  involved  in  poli  tics,  not  just  “whinge  at  a  Shabbat  dinner”,  Einfeld  added.   The  forum’s  next  meeting  will  feature  Shadow  Foreign  Minister  Kevin  Rudd;   Bellevue  Hotel,  159  Hargrave  Street,   Paddington,  October  23,5.30pm.

"  $10.5m  appeal   to  ensure   Jewish  centre   MONASH  University’s  Australian  Centre  for  Jewish  Civilisation  is   seeking  $10.5  million  to  secure   its  future.   “Think  of  the  Jewish   dayschool  system,  the  strength,  the  diversity,  the  quality  of  the  teachers,”  the  centre’s  director,  Professor  Andrew  Markus,  said  at  the  launch  of  it  appeal.   “And  think  about  to  what  extent  are  students  enthused  to  take  Jewish  studies  at  university  level.  The  real  task  is  in  training  teachers  and  further  developing  them  once  qualified.  There  is  a  significant  role  for  the  centre  to  work  in  teacher  development.   “There  is  a  lack  of  under  standing  of  contemporary  issues  and  a  lack  of  academics  able  to  discuss  what  is  happening  in  Israel  and  to  the  Jews  all  over  the  world.”   Emeritus  Professor  Louis  Waller  said  the  centre  is   “regarded  as  one  of  the  most  important  developments  in  teaching  Jewish  heritage”.

"  Muslim,  Jewish   students  compare  dreams  and  hopes   JACQUI  GAL   WHILE  Middle  East  politicians  are  steering  clear  of  the  negotiating  table,  a  growing  number  of  Australian  Jewish  students  are  meeting  for  discussions  with  their  Muslim  counterparts.   The  most  recent  occasion  was  an  afternoon  of  conversation,  coffee  and  cake  between  Year  11  and  12  students  from  Noor  A1  Houda  Islamic  College   in  Condell  Park  and  Emanuel  School  at  the  Emanuel  campus.   Mixing  easily,  the  students  chatted  and  mingled,  almost  indistinguishable  in  their  identical  maroon  school  uni   forms  —  the  hijab  (head  covering)  worn  by  the  female  Muslim  students  notwithstanding.   The  exchange  was  arranged  by  Emanuel  captain  Toolie  Fester  and  prefect  Michael  Edwards,  who  were  inspired  by  a  Mount  Scopus  College  outreach  program  in  Melbourne.   “There’s  something  significant  about  these  two  groups  meeting  because  we  re  both  ethnic  minorities,”  Edwards  said.  “We  both  suffer  from   being  stereotyped  and  from  ignorance,  and  we  can  try  to  break  that  down,  particularly  at  our  young  age.”   Emanuel  student  Aviva  Pinkus  -   who  participated  in  a  Moriah  College  outreach  forum  earlier  this  year,  at  which  students  from  12  schools  gath   ered  to  discuss  discrimination  -  noted  that  “in  our  normal  lives  we  wouldn’t  have  the  opportunity  to  be  one-on-one  with  students  from  an  Islamic  school”.   Two  representatives  of  Emanuel  and  Noor  A1  Houda  each  made  pre  sentations  on  being  part  of  an  ethnic  minority  in  Australia.   “Being  Jewish  is  filled  with  mixed  experiences,”  Fester  said.  “We  hear  about  the  beauty  of  our  multicultural  society,  but  there  is  no  complete  respect  for  those  who  are  a  minority”   Representing  the  Islamic  school,  school  captain  Carawan  Ghanem  agreed-  “To  be  an  ethnic  minority  in  Australia  is  not  difficult,  but  to  be  one  that  is  misunderstood  is  a  challenge.   “My  friends  and  I  have  dreams  of  rising  and  being  seen  in  the  communi  ty  with  a  positive  image  and  integrity.  We  have  the  same  hopes  and  dreams  as   other  Australians.”   Both  groups  expressed  concerns  that  their  achievements  may  be  tainted  with  negative  remarks  about  their  eth  nic  identities,  with  Emanuel  students  singling  out  stereotypes  which  lead  to   antisemitism.   “In  public  schools,  many  Jewish  students  come  across  a  lack  of  under  standing,”  Fester  added  -  “not  borne  out  of  something  sinister,  but  out  of  ignorance.  We  hope  to  minimise  this.”   “We  both  suffer  from   being  stereotyped,  and  we  can  try  to  break  that  !  down.”   i  MICHAEL  EDWARDS   Emanuel  School  prefect   Muslim  student  Chayma  Elbat  stressed  her  wish  to  see  Arabs  and  Jews  live  in  peace.  “For  thousands  of  years  Jews  and  Muslims  lived  in  peace  in  the  Holy  Land,  so  to  say  it’s  not  possible  is  to  deny  history.  It  is  my  fervent  hope  there  will  be  peace  in  the  Holy  Land.”   Noor  A1  Houda  principal  Silma  Ihram  was  one  of  the  founders  of  the   first  Muslim  school  in  Sydney,  A1  Noori,  in  1983  -  coincidentally,  the  same  year  Emanuel  opened  its  doors.   Expressing  the  hope  that  the  meet  ing  would  be  replicated,  Fester  invited  students  to  exchange  emails.  Some   Emanuel  students  have  since  had  fre  quent  on-line  contact  with  their  Noor  A1  Houda  acquaintances.

"  Obsession  with  ‘Jewish  influence’  is  offensive   VIEWPOINT   MICHAEL  DANBY   Australian  Jews  are  part  of  Australian  society  and   exert  their  influence  naturally  through  business,  the   professions,  the  political  parties.  It  is  called  democracy.   ALAN  RAMSEY’S  article  (Syd   ney  Morning  Herald,  30/8/03)  is  a  fine  display  of  his  bile  against  the  Labor  Party  -  a  grudge   which  goes  back  20  years  to  when  he  lost  his  job  as  Bill  Hayden’s  press  sec  retary  when  Bob  Hawke  became   leader  in  1983.   He  also  returns  to  his  obsession  with  these  dastardly  Israelis  and  the  influence  of  Jews  in  Australian  politics.   All  these  issues  appear  related  in  Ramsey’s  mind  because  Hawke  sup  ported  Israel  and  Jewish  causes,  such  as  the  plight  of  Jews  in  the  Soviet  Union.  Over  the  years  Ramsey’s  hatred  of  Hawke  has  fermented  into  noxious  theories  about  Israel  and  Jewish  “influ  ence”.   Support  for  Israel  has  always  been  Labor  policy,  back  to  the  days  when  Dr   H  V  Evatt  was  External  Affairs  minis   ter  in  the  Chifley  Labor  government  at   the  time  of  Israel’s  creation.  It   remained  Labor  policy  under  Whit  lam,  Hawke  and  Keating,  and  appar  ently  to  Ramsey’s  chagrin,  Hayden.   It  has  also  been  Labor  policy  that   there  should  be  a  settlement  between   Israel  and  the  Palestinians,  involving   the  creation  of  a  Palestinian  state.  This  is  what  Ehud  Barak  told  the  Labor  cau  cus  the  Israelis  offered  the  Palestinians.   That  is  the  policy  Simon  Crean  set  out  in  his  speech  last  week-  the  speech  Ramsey  dismissed  as  “blah,  blah,  blah”.   It  is  also  the  policy  that  the  majority  of  Australians,  including  Jewish  Aus  tralians,  support  Indeed,  it  is  a  reflec  tion  of  how  reasonable  most  Israelis,  and  Jewish  supporters  are,  that  despite  all  the  blood  and  gore,  the  majority  of  us  are  still  anxious  to  make  peace.   We  want  to  make  a  deal,  get  on  with  life,  have  our  kids  grow  up  without  the   threat  of  terrorists  blowing  them  up.   It  may  be  asked  why  it  has  taken  more  than  30  years  to  achieve  peace  -  a  question  to  which  Ramsey  gives  no   serious  consideration.   The  most  grievous  error  was  made  by  Arafat  in  the  ’70s  —  to  make  terror  ism  the  principal  weapon  against  Israel   and  to  continue  it  even  as  he  made  peace  after  the  Oslo  Accords.   Arafat’s  decision  has  cost  the  lives  of  thousands  of  Israelis,  Palestinians  and  other  innocent  people  all  over  the  world.  It  has  won  the  Palestinians  grief,  oppression  and  poverty.   Events  like  the  recent  bus  massacre   in  Jerusalem  (not  even  alluded  to  by  Ramsey,  with  his  blind  spot  for  Israeli  suffering)  have  made  it  difficult  for  any  Israeli  government  to  persuade  the  Israeli  electorate  that  concessions  should  be  made.   In  any  case,  when  a  government  has  offered  a  peace  plan,  as  Barak  did  at  Camp  David  in  2000,  it  has  always  been  rejected.   These  are  difficult  issues,  which  can  be  debated.  But  Ramsey  prefers  to  concentrate  on  his  phobias  about  Aus  tralian  Jews  and  their  supposed  sinister   influence  on  Labor.   His  modus  operandi  is  to  attack  people  -  in  this  case  Jeremy  Jones  (ECAJ  president)  and  Carl  Ungerer  (international  affairs  adviser  to  Crean).  In  his  last  attack  on  the  “Jewish  lobby”,  I  was  denigrated  20  times  -  without  being  spoken  to!  Where  is  the  editor  of  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald?   The  majority  of  Australian  Jews  support  Labor  because  they  have  seen  it  as  the  party  of  human  rights  and  opposition  to  antisemitism.  Some  make  substantial  donations  to  Labor,  but  many  also  donate  to  the  Liberal  Party).  So  what?   For  Ramsey  to  suggest  that  Labors  policy  on  the  Middle  East  is  the  result  of  the  manipulations  of  the  “Jewish  lobby”  or  a  desire  for  Jewish  donations  is  an  insult  to  the  party  and  to  Aus  tralian  Jews.   It  is  a  reflection  of  his  parochialism  and  provincialism,  which  infects  his  non-understanding  of  tolerant,  plural   ist,  modem  Australia.   Jewish  organisations  lobby  politi  cians  as  does  anybody  else.  The  Middle  East  is  one  of  the  subjects  they  lobby  about  But  there  are  plenty  of  people  lobbying  for  the  other  side,  and  Labor  decides  its  policy  on  merit   Australian  Jews  are  part  of  Aus  tralian  society  and  exert  their  influence  naturally  through  business,  the  profes  sions,  the  political  parties.  It  is  called  democracy.   Donations  make  up  only  a  small  part  of  Labor’s  income,  which  comes  overwhelmingly  from  public  funding   under  the  Electoral  Act  and  affiliation  fees  and  donations  from  trade  unions.   To  suggest  that  Labor  would  alter  its  policy  for  the  sake  of  a  handful  of  Jewish  donors  is  as  simplistic  as  it  is   offensive.   Finally,  Ramsey  suggests  that  Leo  McLeay  and  other  Labor  MPs  who  support  the  Palestinian  cause  have  been  “muzzled”.  This  is  nonsense;  all  forums  of  the  parliament  and  the  party,  as  well  as  the  media,  are  open  to   MPs  to  air  their  views.   McLeay  and  I  were  dropped  from  the  speakers’  list  in  the  recent  debate  on  the  Middle  East  because  it  was  decided  that  Crean  and  Kevin  Rudd  should  use  that  opportunity  to  set  out  Labor’s  policy.   It  would  not  have  been  necessary  if  people  like  Ramsey,  with  their  ancient  grudges  and  lurid  conspiracy  theories,  had  not  so  thoroughly  misrepresented   the  situation.

"  JUDY  SIEGEL-fTZKGVICH   JERUSALEM  -  An  elderly  Jewish  couple  have  died  of  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)  in  Toronto,  according  to  Deborah  Pakis,  a  student  at  the  Hebrew  University  Hadassah  School  of  Veterinary  Medicine  in  Rehovot  who  returned  this  week  from  the  Canadian  city.   Pakis  told  the  Jerusalem  Post  that  the  man  who  had  not  travelled  to  Asia  was  hospitalised  for  a  heart  condition  in  the  same  room  as  a  SARS  patient  and  apparently  contracted  it  from  him;  the  wife  was  infected  by  her  husband  and  died  as  well.  She  said  that  “Toronto  Jews  are  all  talking  about  the  epidemic”,  and  that  those  who  attended  synagogue  during  Pesach  were  advised  not  to  greet  each  other  with  kisses  or  even  to  shake  hands.  She  visited  her  family  there  during  a  10-day  stay.   But  Pakis,  who  is  “glad  to  be  back  in  Israel”,  said  she  would  not  fear  making  another  visit  to  Toronto  despite  the  SARS  epidemic,  especially  as  she  spent  her  time  in  the  suburbs  and  not  in  the   city  itself,  where  most  of  the  cases  were   reported  In  addition,  most  of  those  who  took  ill  and  died  were  elderly  and   with  chronic  diseases.   Nevertheless,  there  is  still  much  concern,  she  said.  “Some  500  Filipino   Catholics  went  to  a  funeral  that  a  SARS  patient  attended,  and  all  of  them  were  afraid  they  were  exposed.”  She  added  that  students  at  the  University   of  Toronto  Medical  School  were  instructed  not  to  go  to  hospitals  for   their  clinical  studies.   Toronto  Mayor  Mel  Lastman  was  quoted  as  saying:  “I  have  never  been  so  angry  in  my  whole  life.  If  it’s  safe  to  live  in  Toronto,  it’s  safe  to  come  to  Toronto.  This  isn’t  a  city  in  the  grips  of  fear  and  panic.”   The  Interior  Ministry  in  Jerusalem  announced  last  week  it  is  refusing  entry  to  foreign  workers  from  Hong  Kong,  Hanoi  and  parts  of  China.   The  Health  Ministry  has  advised  Israelis  not  to  make  unnecessary  trips  to  Toronto  until  further  notice  because  of  the  SARS  outbreak,  as  they  previously  did  regarding  Hong  Kong,  Beijing,  Guangdong  Province  and  Shanxi  Province  in  China,  Singapore  and  Vietnam.

"  Why  Jewish  women  cover  their  hair   BOOK  REVIEW   GAEL  HAMMER   HIDE  AND  SEEK:  JEWISH  WOMEN  AND  HAIR  COVERING  Edited  by  Lynne  Schreiber   Urim  Publications,  2003,224  pp,  $59.95   TWENTY-FIVE  writers,  including  one  husband,  have  expressed  thoughts,  feelings  and  rationale  on  the  controversial  subject  of  Jewish  women  covering  their  hair  after  mar  riage.   It  is  controversial  because  not  all  Orthodox  women  who  might  have  covered  in  the  past  are  doing  so  now.  The  wife  of  renowned  authority  Rav  J  B  Soleveichik  did  not  cover  her  hair,  setting  a  far-reaching  precedent.   Once,  decent  women  would  never  be  seen  in  public  without  head  cover  ings.  Until  recently,  it  was  a  sign  of  a  woman’s  standing.   Even  late  into  the  20th  century,  Australian  private  girls’  colleges  man  dated  that  students  wore  hats  outside  campus.   The  Torah  tells  of  the  woman  taken  in  adultery  who  was  brought  to   the  high  priest  where  her  hair  was  either  uncovered  or  dishevelled  by  him.  It  was  a  mark  of  shame  to  be  publicly  seen  that  way.   When  every  woman’s  head  was  covered,  there  was  no  issue.  Today  there  is.  What  is  the  problem  with  hair  being  seen?  Why  are  married   women  differentiated  from  unmar  ried  women?  Why  do  some  wear  scarves  or  snoods,  some  wear  hats,  some  wear  wigs  (called  shekels)  and  some  wear  both  wigs  and  hats?  Why  are  some  wigs  really  only  half  wigs?  Why  do  some  women  have  a  small  amount  of  hair  showing  and  some   have  none?   The  permutations  are  amazing,  each  with  its  own  rationale,  group  of  followers  and  rabbinic  decisors  giving  opinions,  which  seem  rather  to  be  questions  of  social  mores  than  of  modesty.   Differences  in  style  come  from  individual  communities.  Sheitels  today  are  quite  magnificent  and  fre  quently  infinitely  more  attractive   than  the  wearer’s  own  hair.   They  are  also  often  made  of  human  hair.  Can  that  be  acceptable?   One  writer  notes  that  the  last  Lubav  itch  Rebbe  said  they  are  quite  accept  able  and  that  women  should  look  very  attractive  to  their  husbands.   Other  contributors  point  out  that  some  rabbis  will  not  even  consider  wigs  and  allow  only  scarves.   Some  of  the  writers  are  witty.  A  bride  writes  of  being  colour  identified  for  her  first  wig:  “Ah,  I  felt  I  had  been  admitted  to  a  new  society,  and  this  was  my  identifying  number.  I  was  a  Jew,  a  woman,  a  lawyer  and  a  kallah  [bride]  and  now  I  was  a  four-six.”   Some  of  the  stories  are  sad.  One  woman  was  widowed  in  her  thirties  with  seven  children.  Even  so,  she  is  halachically  obliged  to  cover  her  head  for  the  rest  of  her  life,  so  that  no  potential  husband  can  see  her  lovely  red  tresses  and  eligible  strangers  assume  she  is  unavailable.  A  divorcee  has  the  same  problem.   Judaism  can  be  unyielding.  There  are  stories  here  from  wig  makers,  from  cancer  sufferers,  from  women  who  have  stopped  covering  their  heads  and  from  women  who  have  moved  to  the  most  stringent  coverings.   The  chumras  (stringencies)  of   some  Hungarian  Chassidim  are  per  plexing  for  the  uninitiated.  The  day  after  her  wedding,  the  mother  or  mother-in-law  of  the  bride  completely  shaves  all  the  hair  off  her  head.  There  after,  every  month  before  going  to  the  mikvah,  the  woman  shaves  her  head.   Why?  What  the  writers  say  is  that  shaving  means  no  hair  can  ever  show  and  that  it  is  “easier”  at  the  mikvah  for  all  their  body  to  be  immersed.   This  seems  arrant  nonsense,  as  the  dimensions  of  the  mikvah  are  more   than  adequate  for  submerging  short  hair  and  even  quite  long  hair.  It  is  also  hard  to  imagine  husbands  taking  joy  in  making  love  to  bald  women.   This  book  is  controversial,  chal  lenging  and  thought  provoking.  Only  10  per  cent  of  Jews  are  Orthodox:  a   fraction  of  those  are  head  coverers.  The  sources  are  given  for  both  cover  ing  and  not  covering.   The  jury  seems  to  come  down  on  the  covering  side,  certainly  in  syna  gogue,  but  in  Judaism,  that  is  not  nec  essarily  significant  to  most  adherents.

"  ONCE  WE  WERE  WORRIERS.   DANNY  KAU   Oy,  it's  a  Jewish  tradition!   IT  happened  at  exactly  10.14  on   Tuesday  morning.  I  was  doing  my  usual  daily  routine,  cleaning  up  the  kid's  bedrooms  -1  have  to  do  it  at  least  two  times  a  day,  and  on  weekends,  every  seven-and-a   half  minutes.   So  I  was.  bending  down  and  picking  stuff  up  from  the  floor,  plastic  animals,  ""Lego  pieces,  Beanie  babies,  a  Wiltshire  Staysharp  Knife  -  I  don't  know  what  the  kids  were  doing  with  the  Wiltshire  Staysharp,  I  mean,  they  know  they're  only  allowed  to  play  with  the  paring  knife.   Anyway,  that's  what  I  was  doing:  bending  down  and  pick  ing  up,  bending  down  and  pick  ing  up,  and  I'd  just  bent  down  to  pick  up  a  little  rubber  Gumby  man,  and  I  was  on  my  way  up  again,  when  the  incident  occurred  -  the  exertion  of  lifting  my  body  created  a  churning  deep  within  my  gut,  a  wave  of  exhaus  tion  flooded  through  my  system,  and  a  noise  came  out  of  my  mouth  ...  a  very  long  slow,  gut  tural  noise  that  sounded  very  much  like  ...  ""Oyyyyyyyy"".   Yes,  that's  right;  at  that  pre  cise  moment,  I  made  my  very  first  ''Oyyyyyyyy"".  At  first  I  couldn't  believe  it:  I  wondered  if  maybe  it  was  an  ""Aiiiiii""  and  there  was  a  bubble  in  my  throat.   I  tried  again:  I  bent  down  and  picked  up  a  Chupa  Chup  that  was  stuck  to  the  carpet,  and  as  I  rose  an  even  greater  force  welled  up  inside,  pervading  every  mole  cule  of  my  entire  being.  Out  of  my  mouth'  came  ...  ""Oyyyyyy  veyyyyyy"".   It  was  happening,  I  was  changing:  I  bent  down  to  pick  up  a  chicken  wing  lying  under  a  bed,  and  now  AN  EXTRAORDINARY  EXPLOSION  OF  JEWISHNESS  BURST  FORTH  FROM  WITHIN  MY   SOUL.  I  muttered  ""Oyyyyyyyyy   gevalt"".   There  was  no  question:  I  had  finally  come  of  age.  In  that  morn  ing,  I'd  gone  from  being  a  young,  healthy,  energetic  Jewish  guy,  to  an  old,  tired,  brow-beaten   OYYYYYY-ER.   Every  Jew  knows  that  at  some  stage  in  their  life,  they  will  become  an  Oyyyyyy-er;  it's  part  of  our  Jewish  destiny  -  one  day  everything's  so  good  and  easy  and  fun,  and  the  next  moment  you  feel  like  it's  all  too  hard,  you're  schlepping  around  every  where,  and  you've  got  a  weight  sitting  on  your  shoulders  that  feels  like  a  Subaru  Forrester  with  Tonia  Todman  sitting  in  the  dri   ver’s  seat.   “Oyyyyyy  is  the   fundamental  chant  of  the  Jewish  person”   Oyyyyy  is  an  expression  that  sums  up  the  very  essence  of  what  it  means  to  be  Jewish  -  tired,  dis  interested,  and  vaguely  irritable.   And  at  the  age  of  39,  I  had  finally  become  a  proper  Jew:  now  I've  started  oyyyying  all  the  time  -  I'm  oyyying  when  I  stand  up,  I'm  oyyyying  when  I  sit  down,  I'm  oyyyying  every  night  when  I  turn  on  SBS  news  and  see  what  outfit  Lee  Lin  Chin  is  wearing.   Oyyyyyy  is  the  fundamental  chant  of  the  Jewish  person  -  in  fact,  I've  often  wondered  if  peo  ple  in  Israel  go  to  big  sporting  events,  and  stand  in  the  stadium,  waving  their  flags  around  in  the  air,  and  yelling  ""ISRAEL,  ISRAEL,  ISRAEL,  OY,  OY,  OYYYYYYYYYYYY"".

"  I  felt  ashamed  for  denying  my  Jewish  identity   VIEWPOINT   EMIL  BLECH   Why  should  a  Catholic   be  proud  of  his  church,  a  Muslim  proud  of  his  mosque,  a  Buddhist   proud  of  his  temple,  but  a  Jew  not  proud  of  his  synagogue?   I  AM  15  and  attend  a  non-Jewish   private  school.  I  have  all  my  life.  I  have  encountered  antisemitism  in  many  different  forms.   be  it  jokingly  or  harassingiy,  I  have   always  tried  to  ignore  it,  so  people  don’t  think  I  am  “emotionally  sensi  tive”  or  that  I  “can’t  take  a  joke”   By  ignoring  it,  I  felt  that  I  would  discourage  it  I  believed  that  as  I  got  older,  people  would  leave  their  igno  rance  behind-1  was  wrong.   While  studying  the  Holocaust  dur  ing  a  history  class,  a  non-Jewish  class  mate  asked:  “Why  didn’t  the  Jews  just  convert?  Their  lives  would  have  been  saved.”   A  Jewish  classmate  replied:   “Because  of  honour”   Never  had  Jewish  honour  meant  so  much  to  me.  It  was  at  that  moment   that  I  realised  the  answer  to  that  ques   tion  was  much  more  than  honour.  It  was  identity  -  identity  as  a  Jew  and  as   a  person.   Why  should  a  Catholic  be  proud  of  his  church,  a  Muslim  proud  of  his  mosque,  a  Buddhist  proud  of  his  tem  ple,  but  a  Jew  not  proud  of  his  syna  gogue?   It  was  this  question  of  keeping  one’s  honour  that  roused  the  Jewish  spirit  in  me.  Wanting  to  understand  what  my  grandparents  and  great-grandparents  had  been  through,  yet  still  keeping  their  Jewish  identity  and  honour.   However,  I  also  felt  ashamed  of   myself  for  denying  my  Jewish  identity  and  therefore  my  very  existence.   Even  during  the  Holocaust,  when  we  were  being  killed,  we  still  kept  our  identity.  We  never  tried  to  run  away   from  who  we  were  and  what  we   believed  in.  Faith  kept  us  together  as  a  people  —  the  binds  of  family  and  the  love  of  community.   I  look  at  modern-day  antisemitism  and  I  believe  it  is  forcing  us  to  lose  our  identity.  What  we  kept  during  the  most  horrific  of  times,  we  are  now  los  ing.  Our  identity  is  being  lost  as  we  assimilate  into  wider  society.  Nowhere  is  this  felt  hardest  than  at  school.   I  used  to  mention  my  religion  only  when  absolutely  necessary,  trying  to  avoid  antisemitism.  I  felt  I  would  be   regarded  as  a  Jewish  friend,  not  just  a   friend.  But  what  I  didn’t  realise  at  the  time  was  that  by  doing  this,  I  was  denying  who  I  was.   When  I  ate  matzah  at  Pesach,  peo  ple  began  to  “catch  on”  to  my  Judaism,  and  I  became  categorised  as  “Jewish”.  Being  placed  in  this  category  meant  that  whenever  I  wouldn’t  lend  some  one  money  or  a  pen,  I’d  be  “Jewish”,  as  if  my  religion  was  some  sort  of  insult   Eventually,  I  grew  a  tough  skin  and  dismissed  any  antisemitism  in  an  off  hand  way.  Not  many  Jewish  teenagers  experience  this  kind  of  antisemitism  because  they  attend  Jewish  schools  or  schools  with  a  majority  of  Jewish  stu   dents.   I’m  not  suggesting  that  Jewish  teenagers  in  Jewish  schools  don’t  expe  rience  antisemitism  at  all,  but  most   wouldn’t  They  are  insulated,  working  and  studying  within  a  predominantly  Jewish  community.   In  fact,  I  believe  that  these  Jewish  students  do  not  realise  the  extent  of  the  threat  that  exists—that  our  identity  as  Jews  within  the  wider  community  is  under  siege  and  that  this  threat  per  vades  everyday  life.   I  don’t  see  a  solution  to  the  prob  lem  of  losing  one’s  Jewish  identity.  Instilling  honour  and  teaching  us  the  importance  of  our  Jewish  traditions  and  culture  helps,  but  I  see  a  future  when  Jews  no  longer  exist  as  a  separate  people  within  the  wider  community.   This  insulation  will  inevitably  lead  to  a  generation  of  Jews  who  will  not  realise  the  threat  that  exists  in  today’s  world  and  will  therefore  enter  the  wider  community  without  any  idea  of  what  to  expect  or  how  to  deal  with  it   As  a  people,  we  have  come  far  in  a  hostile  world,  some  of  whose  elements  want  to  extinguish  us.  This  is  my  chal  lenge  as  a  student  in  a  non-Jewish  school:  to  hold  my  head  high,  to  say  who  I  am  and  to  speak  about  what  my  religion  means  to  me.   I  don’t  want  to  be  scared  of  who  I  am,  nor  should  any  other  Jewish  teenager  be.  Being  Jewish  shouldn’t  mean  being  afraid.

"  Opening  the  door  to  Jewish  mysticism   BOOK  REVIEW   RABBI  JEFFREY  COHEN   THE  COMPLETE  IDIOT'S  GUIDE  TO  JEWISH  SPIRITUALITY  &amp;  MYSTICISM  Michael  Levin   Alpha  Press,  2002,305  pages,  $39.95   MYSTICISM  and  its  child,  kabbalah,  ^  are  fads  of  the  1990s  that  have  contin   ued  to  grow  in  popularity,  helped  by  the  involvement  of  Hollywood  stars  such  as  Madonna.   Coming  out  of  the  rationalist  world,  I  have  always  struggled  with  Mysticism.  The  true  sceptics  reject  it   outright  rather  than  accepting  that  there  are  many  ways  to  find  the  divine  and  that  mysticism  is  one  of   them.   Levin  writes  that  many  people   who  become  involved  in  Buddhism   and  New-Age  religions  in  America  have  Jewish-sounding  family  names.  One  wit  went  so  far  as  to  suggest  that  the  only  “ism”  that  Jews  don’t  try  is  Judaism.   Jewish  tradition  has  advocated  that  mysticism  should  only  be  studied  after  reaching  the  age  of  40  and  being  in  a  stable  long-term  relationship.  It  is  clear  that  this  is  no  longer  acceptable  to  jnany  and  they  turn  to  other  tradi   tions  in  their  search.  In  America,  groups  have  emerged  that  have  drawn  from  the  mystical  tradition.   This  book  has  opened  the  world  of  mysticism  to  the  novice  in  an  easy-to  read  style.   It  uses  the  techniques  made  popu  lar  in  other  volumes  highlighting  “spiritual  citations”  and  “mystical   moments”  and  the  section  called   “high  spirits”  brings  a  smile  to  your   face.   For  so  many,  when  they  hear  the  words  “Jewish  mysticism”  they  tend  to  only  think  of  Chassidism  when  there  is  a  wide  and  varied  arrange  ment  which  forms  what  can  be   described  as  Jewish  mysticism.  It  actually  begins  in  the  Bible,  is  devel  oped  in  the  period  of  the  Talmud  and  is  still  expanding  today.   Among  the  more  interesting  chap   ters  is  one  which  discusses  whether   Jews  believe  in  angels  and  also  addresses  the  key  question  of  whether  Judaism  is  in  itself  spiritual.   This  book  does  not  have  the  facile  cartoons  which  have  been  common  in  other  similar  books.  It  is  an  intro  duction  for  those  who  have  little  knowledge  of  the  subject   Rabbi  Jeffrey  Cohen  is  the  AJN   literary  editor. ",2003-05-30
"  SBS  quizzed  in  parliament  about  Jewish  program  cuts   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   SBS  Radio  head  Quang  Luu  has  been  given  30  days  to  explain  to  a  Senate  Estimates  Committee  why  SBS  is  dropping  two  hours  of  Yiddish/Hebrew  programs,  cutting  the  week’s  Jewish  programs  by  one-third.   Senate  Deputy  Opposition  Leader  Stephen  Conroy,  at  a  committee  hear  ing  on  Monday,  asked  Luu  to  explain   the  cuts  and  said  he  would  want  answers  to  more  detailed  questions.   In  response,  Luu  said  SBS  had   reviewed  schedules  on  the  basis  of  the  2001  Census.  He  said  consultations  six  months  ago  with  more  than  1000  Australians,  including  many  “of  Jew  ish  background”,  re-endorsed  criteria  for  looking  at  the  allocation  of  air  time  to  language  groups.   Criteria  included  the  number  of   people  speaking  a  language  other  than  English  at  home,  aged  people,  new  arrivals,  people  lacking  capacity  in  English  and  employment.   “When  you  apply  those  criteria  today,  you  find  that  there  are  5946  people  speaking  Hebrew  in  the  home  and  2667  speaking  Yiddish,”  he  said.   “There  are  38,731  Indonesian  speakers  and  they  are  entitled  to  three  programs.  The  Hungarian  communi   Senator  Steven  Conroy   ty  has  28,484  Hungarian  speakers  and  also  has  three  programs.   “The  [SBS]  board  agreed  with  our  recommendation  to  take  one  hour  from  the  Yiddish  program  and  the  Hebrew  program.  Even  now,  with  two  programs  each  a  week,  Yiddish  and  Hebrew  speakers  are  taken  care  of?’   Labor  MP  Michael  Danby  pre  pared  the  questions  Luu  must  answer  within  30  days.  He  has  asked  why  SBS  cut  the  Jewish  Friday  program,  which  has  a  higher  number  of  listeners  than  the  Wednesday  program.   He  also  asked  whether  SBS  consid  ered  that  the  Census  underestimated  the  Jewish  population  because  many   Jews  are  fearful  of  registering  on  official  lists  because  of  their  Holocaust  experi   ences.   Danby  said  while  the  Census  showed  the  number  of  Yiddish  speak  ers  fell  by  about  13  per  cent,  Yiddish  programs  lost  33.3  per  cent  of  air  time  and,  while  the  number  of  Hebrew  speakers  rose  slightly,  Hebrew  programs  also  lost  33.3  per   cent  of  air-time.   He  has  put  a  question  to  Commu  nications  Minister  Richard  Alston.   •  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  executive  director  Colin  Rubenstein  has  called  for  a  reversal  of  the  “crude  and  insensitive”  SBS  deci  sion  to  cut  Jewish  programming  despite  an  increase  in  Australia’s  Jew  ish  population.   He  said  an  “unsuitable  and  possibly  discriminatory  method  in  allocating  its  air-time”  neglected  the  fact  that  communities,  especially  multi-lingual  communities,  had  needs  relating  to  program  content  as  much  as  language.   “The  Jewish  community  cannot  be  characterised  solely  by  the  lan  guage  its  members  speak,”  Dr  Ruben  stein  said.  “Many  Jewish  people  would  place  the  language  of  their  country  of  birth  first,  including  Eng  lish,  with  Yiddish  or  Hebrew  second.” ",2003-05-30
"  How  Britain’s  Jewish  leaders  are  failing   VIEWPOINT   DOUGLAS  DAVIS   Labour  legislator  Tam  Dalyell,  a  ferocious   opponent  of  the  Iraq  war  and  a  passionate  proponent  of  the   I  Palestinian  cause,   accused  Tony  Blair  of   being  unduly  influenced  by  “a  cabal  of  Jewish  advisers”.   BRITISH  political  life  is  cur   rently  beset  by  a  slew  of  crises,   from  education  and  health   care  to  welfare  and  pensions.  The  domestic  agenda  is  full.  But  noth  ing  is  calculated  to  raise  the  national  blood  pressure  quite  as  much  as  the   Israeli-Palestinian  conflict.   While  mainstream  British  politics  remains  a  relatively  passionless,  under  stated  business  even  when  vital  public  services  are  in  crumbling  decay,  the  frequent  cry  in  parliament  and  at  pub  lic  demonstrations,  on  television  and  radio  current-affairs  programs,  is   “Palestine”.   It  was  an  elemental  force  in  driving  the  antiwar  movement  and  it  has  become  a  subject  that  is  debated  with  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  a  neu   rotic  obsession.   No  harm  in  supporting  the  Pales  tinians,  of  course;  many  honourable  people  throughout  the  world,  includ  ing  George  W  Bush  and  not  a  few  Israelis,  advocate  Palestinian  state  hood.  But  in  the  British  experience,  there  is  a  sinister  flip  side.   Pro-Palestinian  advocacy  is  played  as  a  zero-sum  game:  support  for  Pales  tine  is  matched  only  by  hostility  to   Israel.   For  many,  perhaps  most,  hatred  of  Israel  transcends  the  policies  of  a  par  ticular  Israeli  government  The  vilifica   tion  of  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  is  intense,  but  so  too  was  the  vilification  of  Yitzhak  Rabin  (“too  little,  too  late”  was  the  left’s  complaint  when  the  Oslo  Accords  were  unveiled).   The  obsession  with  Israel  is  a  hor   ror  at  the  very  existence  of  the  Jewish  State,  evident  by  the  rush  to  expunge  all  things  Israeli  from  British  life.  Calls  for  boycotts  academic,  commercial,  musical  are  now  almost  routine  at  trade-union  conferences.   Few  Jews  in  Britain  believe  that  the  anti-Israel,  anti-Zionist  tide  is  any  thing  but  a  cover  for  antisemitism;  and  last  week  the  cover  was  blown  by  prominent  Labour  legislator  Tam  Dalyell,  a  ferocious  opponent  of  the  Iraq  war  and  a  passionate  proponent  of  the  Palestinian  cause,  who  accused  Tony  Blair  of  being  unduly  influenced   by  “a  cabal  of  Jewish  advisers”.   In  doing  so,  he  has  given  such  pri  vate  thoughts  public  respectability.  He  has  translated  politically  correct  anti  Zionism  to  acceptable  antisemitism.  He  has  broken  the  spell,  removing  the   last  taboo  fr&amp;m  a  hatred  that  dared  not  speak  its  name.   Whether  Dalyell  is  a  practising  antisemite  or  not  (as  he  claims)  is  beside  the  point  The  image  of  a  secret  coven  of  malevolent,  influential  Jews  conspiring  to  manipulate  and  distort  the  global  agenda  for  its  own  narrow  interests  is  almost  as  old  as  anti  semitism  itself.   What  is  new  is  that  an  established,  well-bred  British  politician  did  not  bother  resorting  to  the  customary  codes  and  nuances,  winks  and  nods.  Even  in  Britain,  where  antisemitism  is  embedded  in  the  political  and  social  culture,  such  statements  have  been  rare  occurrences  outside  the  world   inhabited  by  the  far  right.  Now  they  have  become  the  everyday  language  of   the  mainstream  left.   The  reappearance  of  the  old  hatred  has  been  fuelled  by  a  substantial  sec  tion  of  the  Muslim  immigrant  com  munity,  whose  second  generation  is  mostly  undereducated,  underem  ployed,  underpaid  and  considers  itself  underprivileged.  Many  young  British  Muslims  have  sought  solace  in  reli  gion,  and  the  brand  of  Islam  they   imbibe  does  not  derive  from  their  ancestral  homes  in  India,  Pakistan  and  Bangladesh,  but  from  the  Saudi-fund  ed  mosques  and  Wahhabi-trained  imams  of  the  Middle  East,  who  preach  a  message  of  unremitting  hostility  to  America,  Israel  and  Jews.   Drip  fed  on  the  politics  of  victim  hood  and  immersed  in  the  religion  of  grievance,  young  British  Muslims  have  been  indulged  by  a  permissive  multi  culturalism  that  eagerly  embraces  the  yoke  of  post-colonial  guilt  and  excuses   excess  when  it  emanates  from  the  eth  nic  communities.   The  result  is  that  a  significant  num  ber  have  become  radicalised,  anxious  for  the  kind  of  bloody  “martyrdom”  and  vengeance  that  visited  Mike’s   Place  in  Tel  Aviv  last  week.   Most  alarming  is  the  combustible  alliance,  based  on  common  hatreds,  that  has  emerged  between  the  Muslim  radicals  and  those  who  see  themselves   as  progressive,  left-leaning  liberals.  The  old  right-wing  extremists  retain  their  potential  for  anti-semitic  menace,  but  the  real  threat  to  British  Jews,  in  word  and  deed,  is  increasingly  coming  from   the  Muslim-left  alliance.   The  dramatic  rise  in  the  incidence  of  antisemitic  attacks,  verbal  and  phys  ical,  recorded  in  the  first  quarter  of  this  year  by  the  Community  Security  Trust  indicates  where  the  hatred  is  leading.  The  effectiveness  of  the  trust,  which  monitors  antisemitism  and  advises  communal  organisations  on  security  measures,  is  likely  to  be  marginal  at   best  when  faced  with  a  determined  ter  rorist  attack.   The  weakness  lies  in  the  ineffectual,  self-selected  leaders  of  Britain’s  Jewish  community,  who  sometimes  seem  more  concerned  about  where  then  next  state  honour  is  coming  from  rather  than  upsetting  the  political   classes  with  concerns  about  anti  semitism.   In  a  curious  paradox,  Jews  are  seen  as  “the  other”  when  they  scale  the  heights  of  business,  professional  or  political  power,  but  they  are  “one  of   us”  when  the  establishment  examines   the  ingredients  of  the  rich  ethnic  soup  that  they  have  brewed  over  the  past  half-century.   British  Jews  are  regarded  as  too  sue   cessful,  too  educated,  too  rich  and  too  comfortable  to  be  in  need  of  multicul   tural  preference.  And  Jewish  leaders  are  often  only  too  happy  to  play  this  game;  only  too  happy  to  have  the  opportunity  to  reassert  their  British   ness.   Lord  Michael  Levy,  who  has  par  layed  his  fundraising  skills  for  the  Labour  Party  to  high  office  in  the  Blair  administration,  has  proved  an  effective  gatekeeper  for  the  government,  con  trolling  access  and  modulating  the  Jewish  message,  serving  as  a  barrier  rather  than  a  conduit  to  the  corridors  of  power.   The  result  is  that  the  Jewish  com  munity  has  been  left  dangerously  exposed  and  vulnerable.  What  is  urgently  needed,  and  what  is  sorely  lacking,  is  an  effective,  serious  com  munal  voice  capable  of  penetrating  the  Levy  membrane  and  persuading  the   authorities  that  manifestations  of  anti  semitism  should  be  treated  with  the  same  zero  tolerance  as  other  expres   sions  of  racism.   Antisemitism,  like  the  diplomatic  calumnies  regularly  heaped  on  Israel,  is  a  cost-free  exercise.  The  consequence  of  further  inaction  will  lead  inexorably   to  an  escalation  of  vitriol  and  violence.   British  Jewry  will  pay  a  high  price  for  this  negligence.

"  Why  women  are  marginalised  from  Jewish  history   VIEWPOINT   YVONNE  FEIN   It’s  time  to  stop   victimising  women  for  being  women.   Hiding  them  behind   ever-growing  mechitzot   is  a  nonsense.   Tbe  tide  is  flowing.   It  can't  be  stopped.   CONSIDER  this:  King   Solomon  had  700  wives  who  were  princesses  and  300  con  cubines  -  1000  females  in   total.  Using  the  methodology  of  pro  portional  equations  -  and  assuming  one  visit  per  night  -  please  calculate  the  frequency  with  which  each  of  these  women  could  expect  to  have  been  called  upon  by  the  monarch.   For  those  whose  premier  passion  was  never  mathematics,  the  short  answer  is  once  every  2.7  years.  Not  so  good  for  the  women,  but  it  certainly  rendered  the  king  an  expert  on  many  matters  feminine.  He  wrote  some   astounding  poetry  and  psalms  on  the  subject,  several  so  delicate,  so  erotic,  so  passionate,  that  they  caused  scholars  in  later  periods  to  bowdlerise  them,  removing  all  their  sensuality  and  physicality.  They  would  make  the   claim  -  one  which  survived  into  modern  times  -  that  these  poems  were  allegories,  were  nothing  whatso  ever  to  do  with  earthly,  romantic  love,  but  paeans  to  Torah  and  God’s   love  of  Israel.   And  there’s  the  rub.  At  some  point  in  the  history  of  the  Jews,  women  became  marginalised.  Their  hair  and  their  voices  —  frequently  the  subject  of  King  Solomon’s  poetic  ruminations  -  were  ordered  bound  and  gagged  respectively.   Literally.   In  an  appalling  manipulation  of  the  text,  the  famous  Song  of  Song’s  enumeration  of  the  beauty  of  a  woman’s  voice  and  hair  became  the  justification  for  rabbinical  decrees  regarding  their  suppression  or  veiling.  The  logic  went  as  follows:  if  King  Solomon  mentioned  them  in  an  erotic  context,  they  must  be  silenced   and  obscured.  Unfortunately,  there  was  an  insufficient  number  of  literate  women  around  to  say:  hang  on,  the  splendour  of  her  teeth  and  eyes  are   also  extolled  in  other  verses.  Does  that  mean  we  must  be  measured  up  for  opaque  mouth  guards  and  eye  shields  to  cover  even  more  of  our  nakedness?  Or  what  about  an  iron  mask  k  la  Dumas,  or  -  in  support  of  the  local  industry  -  Ned  Kelly  style?   From  there  it  was  surely  a  short  step  to  Rabbi  Eliezer’s  statement  that  whoever  teaches  women  Torah,  teaches  them  immorality.  Enter  the  silenced,  veiled  and  now  illiterate  women  who  are  at  the  mercy  of  auto  cratic,  undemocratic  “law”  makers.   Two  myths  arise  out  of  this  kind  of  leadership,  myths  which  are  so  patently  self-serving  and  yet  which  are  still  able  to  plunge  those  who  attempt  to  debunk  them  into  a  purgatory  (lehavdel)  of  ostracism.   Myth  one:  we  are  a  people  of  the   book.   This  book  -  and  many  of  the  commentaries  which  followed  —  was  written  by  and  for  men,  though  often   about  women,  from  matters  as  intimate  as  menstruation  to  discus  sions  which  dealt  with  the  minutiae  of  what  they  were  permitted  to  wear,  cook,  eat  and  feel.  Thus  the  entire  narrative,  never  mind  the  details  of  female  contributions  to  Judaism,  was  a  closed  book  (inadvertent  but  inevitable  pun)  to  the  women  who’d  helped  create  it  and  about  whom  it  was  composed.   Myth  two:  Jews  pay  a  unique  kind  of  respect  to  their  womenfolk  and  hold  them  in  higher  regard  than  almost  any  other  culture.   In  Orthodox  synagogues,  men  and   wmarnwr^""  n  ■—   Members  of  Women  of  the  Wall  read  from  the  torah.  Is  the  tide  turning?   Photo:  Brian  Hendler/JTA   women  are  separated  by  a  mechitzah;  women  are  not  permitted  to  read  from  the  Torah;  they  are  not  permit  ted  to  lead  services;  they  do  not  count  as  part  of  a  minyan.  Outside  the  syn  agogue,  they  are  not  permitted  to  be   witnesses  in  a  beth  din;  they  are  not  permitted  to  sing  in  public,  their  elbows  and  knees  -  at  the  very  least  -  are  considered  an  incitement  to  las  civiousness,  as  is  the  uncovered  hair  of  a  married  woman  ...   I  don’t  want  that  kind  of  respect.  And  if  I’m  a  person  of  the  book,  I  want  to  be  able  to  read  it,  down  to  the  last  footnote.   When  women  first  read  from  the  Torah,  or  learn  Gemmorah,  when  they  don  tzitzit  or  wrap  themselves  in  a  tallit  for  the  first  time,  the  male  establishment  challenges  their  integrity.  “Are  you  a  feminist  or  are  you  sincere?”  The  question  is  a  delib   erate  distraction  from  the  essence  of   the  women’s  stances:  they  are  merely  existing  inside  centuries-old  rituals  to  which  their  predecessors  have  been  denied  access  for  all  manner  of  unsound  reasons  that  have  everything  to  do  with  male  domi  nance  and  control  and  nothing  to  do  with  God.  They  are  saying,  I  don’t  want  to  stand  on  the  outside  and  sim  ply  watch  any  more.   It  is  time  for  men  to  understand  that  women  are  not  the  enemy.  Men  are  not  the  victims  of  their  own  and  women’s  rampant  sexuality.  In  nor  mal  societies,  normal  restraints  are  effectively  in  place.  It’s  time  to  stop  victimising  women  for  being  women.  Hiding  them  behind  ever-growing  mechitzot  is  a  nonsense.  The  tide  is  flowing.  It  can’t  be  stopped.

It  has  become   the  Jewish  mardi  gras,  a  day  of  revelry,  drinking  and  masquerades.  But  it  is  much   more  than  this.   Purim  is  the  holiday  in  hiding.  One  has  to  probe  beneath  the  surface  to  find  the  spiritual  dimension  that  lies  underneath.  In  fact,  the  disguises  and  masks  are  all  designed  to  underscore  the  essential  hiddenness  of  this  day.   The  very  name  of  its  heroine,  “Esther”,  derives  from  the  root  S’T’R,  meaning  “hidden”.  In  Devarim  (31:18),  God  says  to  Israel:  “I  will  surely  hide  (hastir  astir)  My  face  from  you...”  The  sages  see  this  Hebrew  phrase  as  a  subtle  suggestion  of  the  hiddenness  of  God  during  the   time  of  Esther.   Take  Esther  herself.  No-one  except  Mordechai  knows  who  she  really  is.  Even  King  Achashverosh  is  kept  in  the  dark.  “Ein  Esther  magedet  moledetah  -  Esther  did  not  reveal  her  origins.”  Concealment  is  the  theme  of  the  day.   The  lineage  of  the  protagonists  of  the  story  is  also  one  of  hiddenness.   Mordechai  and  Esther  are  descen  dants  of  mother  Rachel.  Mother  of  Yosef,  Rachel  is  the  very  essence  of  hiddenness  and  concealment.  When  her  sister  Leah  is  substituted  for  her  in   marriage  to  Yaakov,  why  does  Rachel  not  cry  out  and  protest  an  injustice?  Because  to  do  so  would  have  humili  ated  her  sister.  Rachel  knows  how  to  conceal  things,  including  her  bitter  disappointment.  Similarly  Joseph   conceals  himself  from  his  brothers.   Even  God  himself  is  hidden  in  the   Purim  story.  Search  the  megillah  -  and  you  find  no  mention  of  his  name.   Is  this  not  strange  for  a  biblical  book?   To  underscore  the  hiddenness  of  God,  the  entire  story  seems  to  be  one  of  chance  and  coincidence  -  the  very  things  that  the  Bible  tells  us  the  world  is  not!  In  the  megillah,  the  role  of  God  is  unseen,  his  hand  invisible.  Queen  Vashti  just  happens  to  refuse  to  appear  at  the  royal  feast;  the  king  just  happens  to  rid  himself  of  her  and  to  search  for  a  new  queen;  Mordechai  just  happens  to  be  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  moment  to  foil  a  plot  against  the  king;  the  king  just  happens  to  have  a  sleepness  night  and  his  courtiers  remind  him  that  Mordechai  saved  his  life;  Haman  just  happens  to  be  in  the  queen’s  chambers  when  the  king  walks  in.   Even  the  date  on  which  the  Jews  are  to  be  exterminated  is  determined  by  casting  lots  -  the  “pur”  that  gives  us  the  holiday  its  name.   The  interceding  hand  of  God  is  invisible.  It  could  easily  be  ascribed  to  happenstance,  the  way  everything  else  in  the  story  seems  to  be  happenstance.   Even  the  talmudic  dictum   (megillah  7b)  that  ordains  intoxica  tion  on  Purim  “ad  delo  yada  —  until   we  know  not  the  difference  between  cursed  is  Haman  and  blessed  is  Mordechai”  -  is  part  of  the  theme  of  hiddenness.  For  how  strange  is  the  talmudic  advice.  Ours  is,  after  all,  a  tradition  that  abhors  drunkenness.  We  are  a  people  of  the  mind,  discern  ment,  analysis  -  all  those  things  that  fall  under  the  rubric  of  data,  knowl  edge.  But  on  Purim  we  are  bidden  to  become  intoxicated  and  conceal  our  vaunted  data  —  to  the  point  of  “ad  delo  yada  —  until  there  is  no  data”.  We   Kids  dressed  in  disguise  for  Purlm  last  year.  The  masks  are  designed  to  underscore   the  essential  hiddenness  of  the  day.  Photo:  Nigel  Clements   are  to  enter  a  universe  where  reality  has  no  meaning  and  begin  to  realise  that  not  our  intellects  but  the  one  intellect  above  guides  the  world.   There  is  another  strange  hidden  ness  about  Purim.  This  is  the  most   physical  of  all  our  holidays.  The  fes  tive  Purim  meal,  the  sending  of  food  gifts,  the  encouragement  to  drink  to   excess  -  are  matters  that  deal  with  the   body.  By  contrast,  the  most  spiritual  of  holy  days  is  Yom  Kippur.  Our  observance  of  these  two  days  are  in  diametric  opposition  to  one  another.   But  upon  closer  examination  we  perceive  that  the  two  are  closely  relat  ed  in  a  very  hidden  but  real  way.  The  official  name  of  Yom  Kippur  is  Yom  HaKippurim,  literally,  “a  day  like  Purim”.  This  is  stunning.  Yom  Kippur  is  like  Purim?  How  can  this  be?   It  can  be,  because  Purim  and  Yom  HaKippurim  are  mirror  images  of   one  another.  On  one  we  are  forbid  den  to  eat  or  drink;  on  the  other  we  are  bidden  to  do  so.  Yom  Kippur  is   overwhelmingly  spiritual;  Purim  is  overwhelmingly  physical.  But  on  each  day  we  are  required  to  serve  God  fully,   with  our  bodies  and  with  our  souls.   The  lesson  is  clear:  God  can  be  served  not  only  in  the  solemnity  of  a  Yom  Kippur,  but  also  in  the  revelry  of  a  Purim.  God  is  present  not  only  in  the  open  ark  of  Yom  Kippur  when  spirituality  seems  so  close,  but  also  in  the  open  food  and  drink  of  Purim  when  spirituality  seems  so  remote.  It  is  much  more  of  a  challenge  to  remember  God  amidst  the  revelry  than  to  remember  Him  amidst  of  the   solemnity.  To  imbibe  and  to  feast  and  to  remember  the  Author  of  all;  is  perhaps  a  greater  challenge  than  any  other  holy  day.   Purim  is  the  holiday  in  hiding,  behind  a  mask.  But  its  message  need  not  be  concealed  from  us.   Rabbi  Emanuel  Feldman’s  latest  book  is   The  Shul  Without  A  Clock  Second   thoughts  from  a  rabbi’s  notebook ",2003-03-14
"  Jewish  sailors  come  to  the  surface  in  US  warships   “We  will  find  at  least  10  to  15  who  are  willing  to  participate,  and  then   you’ll  have  others  who  hide  away  and  won’t  want  to  get  involved.”   RABBI  MAURICE  KAPROW   Deputy  chaplain,  US  Navy  Sixth  Fleet   JANINE  ZACHARIA  meets  a  US  Navy  rabbi  who  moves  from   ship  to  ship  in  search  of  Jewish   sailors.   ABOARD  the  USS  Theodore   Roosevelt,  in  the  eastern  Mediterranean,  it  was  Fri  day  evening.  Rabbi  Maurice  Kaprow,  deputy  chaplain  of  the  US  Navy’s  Sixth  Fleet,  led  a  small  congregation  aboard  this  aircraft   carrier  in  a  kabbalat  Shabbat  service.   As  we  reached  the  verse  in  Lecha  Dodi  translated  as  “whose  shelter  of  peace  is  spread  over  us”,  a  jet  returning  from  an  operation  in  northern  Iraq  slammed  down  on  the  flight  deck  above  us,  sending  a  rumble  through  the  chapel.   Kaprow,  a  Conservative  rabbi  from  Florida,  had  just  arrived  aboard  for  a  three-week  stint  during  which  he  plans  to  hold  Shabbat  services,  Fri  day  night  dinners  and  a  Pesach  seder.   He  hopes  to  establish  a  Jewish  pro  gram  on  board  that  can  be  self-run   once  he  leaves.   “We  know  from  experience  that,  until  a  rabbi  comes  out,  Jews  hide,”  he  said.   Rabbi  Kaprow,  58,  said  about  one  per  cent  of  the  navy  is  Jewish,  leading   him  to  believe  that  there  could  be  as   many  as  50  Jews  among  the  crew  of  5000.  (When  I  arrived,  I  could  only  find  two;  after  three  weeks,  I  have  met  five.)   Kaprow  is  the  only  rabbi  with  the  Sixth  Fleet.  There  are  only  nine  rabbis  in  the  entire  US  Navy.   On  Friday,  three  Jews  turned  up,  besides  me  and  a  press  photographer.  There  were  a  few  non-Jews  too.   Rabbi  Kaprow  plans  to  wander  the  ship  in  search  of  more  Jews,  hoping  they  will  spot  either  his  kippa  or  the   A  warship  releases  its  deadly  payload.

We  read  from  navy-issued  prayer  books.  Rabbi  Kaprow  explained  some  of  the  prayers  and  instructed  how  to  sing  Shabbat   Shalom.   Adon  Olam  was  chanted  to  the  tune  of  It's  A  Small  World,  the  way  he  used  to  do  it  with  a  congregation  in  Orlando,  Florida.   For  kiddush,  we  were  each  given  a  thimble  of  Kedem  wine,  and  the  bottle  was  then  locked  away.  Rabbi  Kaprow  apologised  for  not  having  had  enough  time  to  arrange  for  challah  and  promises  to  have  the  bakers  prepare  it  for  next  week.   Before  the  service,  we  aired  out  a  Torah  scroll,  which  had  been  locked   away  in  a  black  case,  unused  since  the  ship’s  last  cruise  during  the  campaign  in  Afghanistan.   Rabbi  Kaprow  delivered  a  short  sermon  as  the  planes  continued  to   slam  down  above.   He  described  the  war  as  a  “milchemet  mitzvah  -  an  obligatory  war”  and  said  Purim,  which  went  unmarked  on  the  ship,  was  timely.  “Were  fighting  another  Haman.”   Rabbi  Kaprow  is  a  wandering  Jew  of  sorts.  There  are  54  ships  currently  in  the  US  Sixth  Fleet’s  area  and  he  moves  from  one  ship  to  the  other.   Before  this  ship  he  spent  three  weeks  on  the  destroyer  USS  Winston  S  Churchill  where  he  found  three  Jews  in  a  crew  of  350.   A  few  months  ago  he  was  aboard  the  carrier  USS  Harry  S  Truman,  where  there  are  now  15  active  Jews.   Rabbi  Kaprow  did  not  expect  to  join  the  navy.  He  started  out  as  a  pub   lic  school  teacher  and  administrator.   “I  had  s’micha  [ordination]  but  I  never  wanted  to  use  it,”  he  said.  In  the  late  1980s,  he  started  a  small  commu   nal  family  service  m  urianao.  Sometimes  he  visited  jails.  In  the  summer  of  1989,  a  friend  asked  if  he  wanted  to  be  a  civilian  contractor  in  the  navy  for  three  to  six  months.   Rabbi  Kaprow  accepted  and  by  the  end  of  his  stint,  he  had  50  kids  attend  ing  Shabbat  services.  He  had  also  decided  he  was  joining  up.   “I  fell  in  love  with  those  kids,”  he  said.  His  first  deployment  was  aboard  the  USS  Saratoga  in  the  Red  Sea  during  the  first  Gulf  War.   “It’s  great  that  a  rabbi  came  on  board,”  said  Nathaniel  Miller,  20,  an  electronics  engineer  from  Pennsylva  nia.  “Like  he  said,  we  were  in  hiding.”   Christopher  Schikevitz,  of  Kansas  City,  Missouri,  believes  “there’s  enough  of  us  for  a  minyan”.   And  John  David  Shelton,  who  works  in  combat  systems,  plans  to  participate  in  any  new  Jewish  programming.  Raised  Baptist,  he  has  recently  decided  to  convert  to  Judaism,  inspired  by  his  brother-in  law  who  did  so  a  year  ago.   JERUSALEM  POST ",2003-04-04
"  The  dangers  for  Jewish  soldiers,  journalists   MICHAELJJORDAN   NEW  YORK  -  It’s  now  well  known  that  just  before  Daniel  Pearl’s  captors  in  Pakistan  slit  his  throat  last  year,  they  forced  the  Wall  Street  Journal  reporter  to  admit  his  Jewish  blood.   Less  well  known  is  that  during  the  first  Gulf  War  captured  American  pilots  were  quizzed  about  their  religion  by  their  Iraqi  torturers.   “What  is  your  religion?”  a  beaten,  bloodied  and  blindfolded  marine  Captain  Michael  Craig  Berryman  was  asked,  according  to  testimony  from  January,  1991.   “Baptist,”  he  replied.   “No,  you  are  a  Jew!”  they   screamed.   The  beatings  grew  more  savage,  said  Captain  Berryman,  adding:  “They  just  went  crazy.”   Neither  the  pilots  nor  Pearl,  according  to  those  familiar  with  his  case,  were  captured  because  of  their  real  or  perceived  Jewishness.   Nevertheless,  for  the  coundess  journalists  and  soldiers  now  in  Iraq  who  are  Jews,  recent  history  indicates  that  their  faith  carries  added  risk  in  case  of  capture  or  imprisonment   There  are  crucial  distinctions  between  soldiers  and  journalists  in  hot  spots.  Soldiers  are  obeying  orders,  while  journalists  are  there  willingly.  And  soldiers  are  combatants,  whereas  journalists  are  not.   Last  month  the  British  Ministry  of  Defence  agreed  to  allow  Jewish  sol  diers  to  erase  religion  from  their  dog  tags,  out  of  concern  in  the  British  Jewish  community  that  they  may  be  singled  out  for  harsher  treatment.   In  the  first  Gulf  War,  US  Jewish  soldiers  deployed  to  the  Gulf  were  encouraged  to  shield  their  identity  and  classify  themselves  on  their  dog  tags  as  “Protestant  B”,  an  internal  code  to  let  military  chaplains  know  the  person  was  Jewish.   The  US  military  has  made  no  concessions  this  time  around,  according  to  Pentagon  spokesman  Major  Tim  Blair.   “We’re  not  looking  at  this  from  the  perspective  of  any  specific  religion,  but  from  international  law  regarding  prisoners  of  war,”  Major  Blair  said.   “We  now  have  4000  or  so  enemy  Iraqi  prisoners,  and  we’re  giving  them  proper  treatment  according  to  the   Geneva  Convention,  if  not  better.  And  we  expect  the  same  humane  treatment  from  the  Iraqis  who   Daniel  Pearl,  a  Jewish  Journalist,  was  killed  in  Pakistan  in  February  2002.   Photo:  AAP/AP   have  our  POWs.”   The  Geneva  Convention,  adopted  in  1949,  states  that  “members  of  armed  forces  who  have  laid  down  their  arms  shall  in  all  circumstances   be  treated  humanely,  without  any  adverse  distinction  founded  on  race,  colour,  religion  or  faith”.   It  is  this  passage,  among  others,  that  lawyers  for  17  American  POWs  -  and  37  of  their  family  members  -  contend  the  Iraqis  violated  in  the  first   Gulf  War.   “A  Jewish,  Baptist  or   even  a  Muslim  soldier  is  likely  to  be  treated  equally  badly  by  this  Iraqi  regime”   JOHN  WALCOTT   Journalist   In  their  $610  million  lawsuit  against  Iraq,  which  co-counsel  John  Norton  Moore  says  will  soon  come  before  the  District  of  Columbia’s  Fed  eral  District  Court,  several  POWs  describe  how  they  were  not  only  accused  of  concealing  their  religion,  but  had  their  pants  yanked  down  and  genitals  inspected.   “The  Iraqis  were  apparently  unaware  that  many  American  males  are  circumcised,  regardless  of  their  religious  beliefs,”  said  Moore.   “It  was  also  reasonably  clear  to  those  subjected  to  this  offensive  treat  ment  that  if  they’d  been  Jewish,  they  would  have  been  subjected  to  greater  danger  and  greater  torture.”   The  greater  risk  for  Jewish  soldiers  is  no  secret  to  their  families.  “It’s  a  big  concern,”  said  Allan  Rubin,  whose  son,  Daniel,  21,  is  a  marine  currently  in  Iraq.  “We  talked  to  him  and  said  he  has  to  be  extremely  careful  about  it.”   Their  son,  though,  is  full  of  youth  ful  bravado,  even  sporting  a  Star  of  David  tattoo  on  one  of  his  muscular  shoulders.   Rubin’s  father  said:  “He  kept  telling  us  not  to  worry,  that  the  Iraqis  better  watch  out  because  he’s  six  feet  two  inches  and  could  kick  their  butts.”   Judy  Ledger  is  likewise  concerned  for  her  son,  Matthew  Boyer,  who  is  also  a  marine  in  Iraq.  The  24  year  old’s  dog  tag  clearly  states  his  religion  as  Judaism.   Ledger  said:  “When  it  comes  to  POWs,  I  just  think  Daniel  Pearl  -   that’s  all  I  can  think  about.”   Despite  Pearl’s  death,  the  Wall  Street  Journal  maintains  a  long-stand  ing  editorial  policy  of  being  blind  to  religion,  said  Brigitte  Trafford,  spokeswoman  for  Dow  Jones,  the  JoumaTs  parent  company.   “We  assign  our  reporters  on  the  basis  of  their  talent  and  the  need  for  the  assignment  -  not  on  the  basis  of  their  race,  religion  or  ethnicity,”  Traf   ford  said.   “As  with  all  assignments,  if  there’s  some  perceived  element  of  risk,  the  reporters  have  to  volunteer  for   the  task”   It’s  a  policy  most  editors  and  jour  nalists  say  they  agree  with:  let  the  journalist  decide  if  their  Jewishness  makes  it  too  risky.   John  Walcott,  who  heads  up  Knight  Ridder’s  war  coverage  and  is  its  Washington  bureau  chief,  said  he  was  unaware  who  among  his  staffers  in  Iraq  is  Jewish,  though  he  acknowl  edges  they  may  face  rougher  treat  ment  should  they  be  captured.   “I  honestly  believe  that  with  the  US  gunning  for  Saddam,  those  dis  tinctions  are  rapidly  shrinking.  A  Jew  ish,  Baptist  or  even  a  Muslim  soldier  is  likely  to  be  treated  equally  badly  by  this  Iraqi  regime,”  said  Walcott   “They  are  likely  to  lump  together  all  Americans  and  Brits  together  as  ‘Jews  and  crusaders’  in  much  the  same  way  that  Osama  bin  Laden  has.”   Pulitzer  Prize-winning  journalist  Joshua  Friedman,  who  began  report  ing  from  the  Arab  world  40  years  ago,  said:  “After  the  Daniel  Pearl  murder,  I  think  journalists  who  are  Jewish  have  to  be  very  careful  about  putting  themselves  in  a  place  where  their  lives   will  be  at  risk   “We’re  vulnerable  because  we’re  Jewish,  and  I’d  never  felt  that  before.  There’s  a  fever  of  antisemitism  today  in  Muslim  countries  and  we  have  to  face  it.”   JTA ",2003-04-04
"  Why  Superwo   COUNTERPUNCH   DVIR  ABRAMOVICH   JEVE  come  a  long  way.  Believe  it  or  not,  Jewish  femi  nism  has  been  one  of  the   greatest  changes  in  Jewish  life,  creating   one  of  the  most  monumental  shifts  in   centuries  of  history.  Consciously  or  unconsciously,  feminism  has  impacted  on  Jewish  women,  whether  religiously  observant  or  not,  permeating  all  aspects  of  Judaism  and  creating  a  more  fulfilling  lifestyle  in  the  process  that  should  make  everyone  cheer.  And  the/re  doing  it  on  their  own  terms.   The  facts  on  the  ground  tell  us  that  women  have  slowly  catapulted  themselves  from  the  margins  to  the  centre  and  have  become  prime  moulders  of  the  21st  century.   [Feminism  is  not  only  about  anger,  bitterness  and   hostility;  women  don't  want  to  destroy,  they  want  to  be  included  and  respected.   I  like  people  who  rock  the  boat  and  I  refuse  to  downplay  the  significance  of  Jewish  feminism.  And  don’t  let  anyone  tell  you  that  there  hasn’t  been  a  tremendous  change  in  a  remarkably  short  time.  The  in-your-face  verbal  brickbats,  blanket  assertions  and  sweeping  generalisations  must  give  way  to  a  balanced  discussion.  Consid  er  the  yeshivot  and  Jewish  schools  where  young  women  are  fully  educat  ed,  bat  mitzvah  ceremonies,  Rosh  Chodesh  celebrations  (reclaiming  a  long-neglected  Jewish  festivity  of  the  new  moon),  new  blessings,  female  rab  bis  and  executives  holding  prominent  positions  in  the  Jewish  world.   In  large  measure,  enough  time  and  achievements  have  been  chalked  up  for  feminists  to  acknowledge  the  accomplishments.  In  a  word,  it’s  not  all   bad.   Yes,  I  know,  there  are  real  reasons  to  lament  patriarchy's  oppression  or  to  list  more  worthy  goals  or  to  contest  and  confront  -  but  the  facts  on  the   ground  tell  us  that  women  have  slowly  catapulted  themselves  from  the  mar  gins  to  the  centre  and  have  become  prime  moulders  of  the  21st  century.  Feminism  is  not  only  about  anger,  bit  terness  and  hostility;  women  don’t  want  to  destroy,  they  want  to  be  included  and  respected.   And  let’s  not  forget  the  serious  impact  the  feminist  movement  has  made  on  the  field  of  Jewish  studies.  Putting  aside  the  universal  oppression  issue,  female  scholars,  while  admitting   that  the  status  of  women  over  the  cen  turies  has  been  less  than  ideal,  have  at  the  same  time  described  the  strong,  active  visionary  women  of  Jewish  his  tory  and  have  resurrected  female  role  models  for  future  generations.   Others  have  argued  that  women  have  always  held  responsible  positions  within  the  family  and  have  never  been  the  passive  or  submissive  types  we  are  frequently  told  about  I  like  theologian   Susanna  Hesdiel’s  observation  that   women  are  more  like  an  orange  on  the  seder  plate,  not  a  rebuke  to  tradition,   but  a  fertile  addition  to  it   This  is  not  to  say  that  women  have  not  suffered  grave  injustices.  But  the  whole  truth  and  nothing  but  the  truth   is  that  even  pre-feminist  writers,  such  as  Devorah  Baron,  Yocheved  Bat  Miri  am  and  Anzia  Yezierska,  wrote  stories  about  brave  and  creative  women  who  rallied  against  the  perceived  limita  tions  of  their  religion  and  imagined  new  choices  and  ways  of  life.  Contem  porary  Jewish  women  now  have  the  choice  to  work  in  or  outside  the  home,  the  chance  to  gain  an  education,  Jew  ish  and  secular,  and  of  course  the  opportunity  to  write  about  women’s   issues.   Furthermore,  the  tales  of  pivotal  women  in  Jewish  history  are  being  unearthed.  I  read  that  countless  femi  nist  Pesach  haggadahs  are  on  sale,  that  Jewish  feminist  scholarship  has  exploded  over  the  last  20  years  (Read  ing  Ruth,  Standing  Again  at  Sinai,  Yentl’s  Revenge,  Out  of  the  Garden)  and  that  even  as  we  weep  over  Jewish  con  tinuity,  women  of  all  ages  are  finding  their  way  into  (and  back  to)  Judaism.   There  are  even  texts  dealing  with  lesbian  Jews  (Nice  Jewish  Girls,  Twice  Blessed)  and  others  tacking  the  insidi  ous  stereotype  of  the  JAP  (Jewish  American  Princess)  or  the  one  about  the  Jewish  mother.   Rather  than  reject,  women,  holding  wildly  different,  sometimes-opposi  tional  perspectives,  are  unearthing   new  room  for  innovation  minus  the  trappings  of  patriarchy.  Feminism  has  even  taught  men  new  ways  of  looking  at  themselves  as  men  -  that’s  progress  for  you.   Certainly,  in  the  Progressive  and  Conservative  congregations  women   have  gained  to  access  to  virtually  every  sphere  of  our  religion.  And  there  are  a  growing  number  of  Orthodox  women  who  are  pushing  the  limits  of  religious   tradition.   Yet  feminism’s  influence  reaches  even  far  beyond  such  issues.  It  has  meant  that  young  women  now  expect  to  participate  fully  in  the  life  of  their  religious  community.   Sure,  many  challenges  remain  for  Jewish  women  -  the  agunot  (chained  women)  issue  to  name  but  one  (femi  nists  have  spoken  about  prenuptial  agreements  that  would  force  both  hus  band  and  wife  to  grant  a  religious  divorce  in  the  case  of  a  civil  divorce)  but  in  the  spirit  of  honesty  we  must  congratulate  Jewish  women  on  the  genuine  vision  and  revision  they  have  shown  and  for  their  courage  to  strug  gle  and  acquire  a  place  in  the  sun.  In  fact,  some  believe  that  only  women   can  save  Judaism  from  decline.   About  six  years  ago  a  rabbi  at  an  American  shul  asked  the  kids  during  Purim:  “Vashti  disobeyed  the  king.   Was  she  bad?”   A  girl  of  about  eight  raised  her  arm  and  said,  “Well,  the  king  thought  she   was  bad.  But  she  was  also  kind  of  good.”  Enough  said.   Dr  Dvir  Abramovich  is  the  Jan  Randa  lecturer  in  modem  Hebrew  literature,   language  and  Judaic  studies  at  the  University  of  Melbourne’s  Centre  for   Jewish  history  and  culture.

"  Reports  of  Jewish  Labor  pains  have  been  exaggerated   VIEWPOINT   PHILIP  MENDESAND  GEOFFREY  LEVEY   The  Jewish  vote  is  not  uniform  or  correlated   solely  with  positions  on   ,  *  the  Middle  East  Nor  is  it   particularly  influential.   RECENT  reports  in  both  the   Jewish  and  mainstream  press  have  suggested  a  major  rift  between  the  Jewish  community  and   the  Australian  Labor  Party  over  Mid  dle  East  policy,  with  potentially  seri  ous  political  and  electoral  implications  for  Labor.   According  to  this  narrative,  anti  Israel  statements  by  federal  Labor  backbenchers  Julia  Irwin  and  Tanya  Plibersek  upset  the  Jewish  communi  ty,  some  pro-Labor  Jews  responded  by  threatening  to  switch  political  and  financial  support  to  the  Liberals,  other  Jewish  Labor  supporters  estab  lished  a  Jewish  Labor  Forum  to  counter  this  anti-Labor  backlash,  and  finally  Labor  leader  Simon  Crean  intervened  with  passionate  public  restatements  of  Labor’s  pro-Israel  position  to  the  Melbourne  and  then  Sydney  Jewish  communities  in  order  to  repair  the  damage.   There  was  never  much  substance  or  significance  to  this  supposed  rift.  Many  Jews  no  doubt  took  exception  to  Irwin’s  and  Plibersek’s  remarks,  and  Crean  may  well  have  acted  soon  er  to  clarify  official  Labor  policy  on   the  Middle  East   It  is  also  conceivable  that  some   Jews  -  to  use  the  AJN’s  marvellously  vague  phrase  -  might  have  considered  changing  their  voting  preference  over  the  episode.   However,  none  of  this  warrants  the  importance  commentators  have  ascribed  to  these  events.  The  Israeli   Palestinian  conflict  is  not  a  major  issue  in  Australian  politics.  The  Labor  leadership  has  far  higher  daily  priori  ties  to  address:  economic  and  budget  ary  management,  health,  education  and  welfare  policy,  family  law  debates,   industrial  relations  and  events  in  nearby  Indonesia,  to  name  a  few.   Except  in  rare  circumstances,  Israel-Palestine  doesn’t  rate  more  than  passing  attention.  The  Jewish  vote  is  not  uniform  or  correlated  solely  with  positions  on  the  Middle  East  Nor  is  it  particularly  influentiaL   The  available  evidence  suggests  that  most  Australian  Jews  follow  their  socioeconomic  interests  and  vote  conservative.   Even  without  Prime  Minister  Howard’s  strong  pro-Israel  record,  Jewish  support  for  the  coalition  is  unlikely  to  waver  much.  The  same  applies  to  the  minority  of  Jews  who  vote  Labor.  Many  of  them  are  con  cerned  about  other  issues,  such  as   Aboriginal  rights,  support  for  asy  lum-seekers,  defending  Medicare,  etc.  A  minority  of  left-leaning  Jews  may  even  support  Labor  taking  a  more  critical  position  vis-a-vis  Israel.   Exceptions,  as  always,  prove  the  rule.  The  only  parliamentary  seat  sig  nificandy  affected  by  a  Jewish  vote  is  Melbourne’s  inner-city  area  of  Mel   bourne  Ports.   There,  many  swinging  Jewish  vot  ers  currendy  support  sitting  MP  Michael  Danby  precisely  because  he  is  Jewish  and  passionately  pro-IsraeL   For  this  reason,  they  also  are  unlikely  to  change  their  vote  simply   because  some  other  Labor  MPs  express  contrary  views.   The  question  of  Jewish  donations  to  Labor  also  needs  to  be  put  in  con  text  With  few  exceptions,  the  major  Jewish  donors  appear  to  be  motivated  by  personal  business  interests  as  much  as  by  specifically  Jewish  con  cerns,  and  many  donate  to  both  sides  of  politics  accordingly.   None  of  the  major  figures  have  gone  on  record  as  threatening  to  withdraw  from  donating  to  Labor.  There  is  a  perception  that  Jewish  communal  bodies  have  the  capacity  to  exert  disproportionate  influence   on  Australian  political  debates  around  Middle  East  policy.   Certainly,  such  bodies  are  general  ly  better  organised  and  more  robust  than  their  local  Arab  and  Muslim  counterparts.   This  presumably  is  why  Simon  Crean  felt  the  need  to  reassure  the   Jewish  community.  However,  organi   sations  do  not  vote  in  Australian  elec  tions,  and  the  real  political  influence  of  such  groups  remains  a  matter  of  conjecture.   The  Labor  Party  and  the  Jewish  community  share  a  long  history  of  mutual  support  and  engagement.  While  the  degree  of  Jewish  support  for  Labor  may  have  waned  since  the  1960s,  this  productive  co-operation  is  likely  to  continue  despite  the  recent,  insubstantial  tensions  over  Middle  East  policy.

"  ArtsE   Outreach  part  of  the  picture  at  Jewish  film  festivals   Joe  Berkofsky   NEW  YORK  —  One  recent  Sunday,  1200  people  at  the  vintage  Coolidge  Corner  cinema  in  Brookline,.  Massachusetts,  nibbled  Jewish  flavoured  barbecued  wings.   Film  screenings  sandwiched  around  the  chicken  and  coleslaw  included  Shalom,  Y’all  and  Kinky   Friedman:  Proud  to  be  an  asshole  from  El  Paso.   Those  two  documentaries  about  Jews  and  the  American  South  were  among  dozens  of  offerings  at  the  recent  14th-annual  Boston  Jewish  Film  Festival.   Though  not  exactly  glatt  kosher,  the  films  —  and  meat  —  were  a  fun   way  to  do  something  more  at  the  fes  tival,  says  executive  director  Sara  Rubin.   Perhaps  much  more,  when  it  comes  to  filling  Jews’  appetite  for  greater  identity,  according  to  a  new  report  by  the  Jewish  Outreach  Institute  (JOI)  in  New  York.   The  study,  titled  Can  watching  a  movie  lead  to  greater  Jewish  affilia  tion?  insists  that  the  burgeoning   Jewish  film  festival  scene  holds  not   only  big  box-office  potential  but  the  possibility  of  moving  unaffiliated  Jews  “along  the  continuum  of  Jewish  involvement”.   The  institute  examined  46  festi   vals.  One-quarter  of  them  were  inde  pendently  run,  while  the  others  had  some  kind  of  sponsorship  by  Jewish  institutions  or  organisations.   “Film  festivals  serve  as  an  entry  into  the  Jewish  community,”  said  JOI  spokesman  Paul  Golin.  For  no  Jewish  obligation  or  commitment  stricter  than  the  price  of  admission,  any  Jew  can  explore  new  Jewish  worlds  in  the  anonymity  of  a  darkened  movie  cine   ma.   JOI  program  officer  Hannah  Greenstein,  who  was  co-author  of  the  report,  said  festivals  should  view  their  audiences  in  the  same  way  that  advertisers  would  target  buyers.   “Jewish  film  festivals  must  have  an  outreach  goal,  they  must  seek  out  marketing  opportunities  to  the  unaf  filiated  or  the  disengaged,”  she  said,  adding  that  the  opportunities  were  booming.   America’s  first  Jewish  film  festival  was  launched  in  San  Francisco  in   1980  and  has  spawned  more  than  60  similar  events  annually  around  the  country.   Another  half-dozen  are  held  in  Canada,  and  about  two  dozen  global   ly,  from  London  to  Hong  Kong  to  Sao   Paulo  and  in  Australia.   In  one  sure  sign  that  the  festivals  have  arrived,  the  National  Foundation  for  Jewish  Culture  (NFJC)  sponsors  an  annual  Jewish  film  festi   val  conference.  The  third  such  con   ference,  to  be  held  in  San  Diego  in  February,  will  explore  issues  such  as  curating  films  about  Israel  in  the  Diaspora.   The  NFJC  also  receives  up  to  70  applicants  each  year  for  the  $US150,000  it  awards  annually  for  Jewish  documentary  film  making.   “Jewish  film  festivals  are  one  sig  nal  of  a  Jewish  renaissance  cultural  ly,”  said  NFJC  executive  director  Richard  Siegel.  “They’re  multiplying,  so  clearly  they’re  hitting  a  responsive   chord.”   The  box  office  is  heating  up  too,  opening  the  doors  to  even  wider  Jewish  involvement.  San  Francisco  has  grown  into  the  biggest  event,  attracting  34,700  people  watching  nearly  50  films  in  2002.   During  2002  Toronto  was  next  with  some  15,000  people  seeing  more  than  60  films,  while  Boston  drew  a  record  13,000  people  year,  up  18  per  cent  from  the  previous  year.   Among  the  larger  festivals,  Boston  has  grown  from  10  films  at  its  incep  tion  to  45  films  from  14  countries  and  a  $US400,000  budget.   The  Boston  film  festival  also  hosts   Jewish  films  throughout  the  year  that  attract  some  10,000  viewers.   Officially,  the  Boston  festival  aims  to  showcase  the  best  contemporary  films  from  around  the  world  dealing   with  Jewish  themes.   But  Rubin  said  the  festival  also  “pushes  the  envelope  on  what  is  Jewish  and  hopes  to  spark  debate  about  Jewish  themes”.   “Jewish  film  festivals  must  have  an  outreach  goal,  they  must  seek  out  marketing   opportunities  to  the   unaffiliated  or  the   disengaged.”   Hannah  Greenstein,  Jewish  Outreach  Institute  “The  festival  is  a  comfortable   place  to  be  uncomfortable  about  your  Jewishness,”  she  said.   The  barbecue  held  at  a  trendy  art  house  for  the  most  recent  festival  echoed  the  kind  of  non-traditional  twist  that  the  JOI  applauded  as  a  cre  ative  way  to  promote  Jewish  interest.   But  JOI  director  of  research  Gail  Quets,  who  is  a  co-author  of  the  study,  said  anyone  expecting  people  to  walk  out  of  such  events  with  a  new   Jewish  identity  was  deluding  himself.   “Outreach  is  a  sequence  of  activi  ties.  People  don’t  see  a  Jewish  film  and  run  out  and  join  a  synagogue,”   she  said.   The  JOI  report  urges  festivals  to  program  “next  steps”  to  greater  Jewish  activity.  Ideas  include  infor  mation  tables,  panels  of  experts  around  film  topics  or  even  crossover  events  to  other  communities  featured  in  some  of  the  films.   Synagogue  affiliation  or  ties  to  organised  Jewry  might  come  later.  But  Siegel  said  traditional  notions  of  Jewish  affiliation  —  such  as  syna  gogue  membership  or  federation  donations  —  must  be  expanded  as   well.   “Jewish  film-going  is  not  affiliation,  it’s  participation  in  an  active  and  meaningful  way,”  he  said.  “Why  should  a  synagogue  member  who  attends  three  times  a  year  be  consid  ered  more  engaged  than  an  active  participant  who  debates  films  at  a  fes   tival?”   What’s  more,  the  film-going  expe  rience  —  a  collective  act  that  is  expe  rienced  individually  —  is  “essentially  what  the  prayer  experience  is”,  he   said.   If  Jewish  film  festivals  are  becom   ing  the  spiritual  realm  of  the  barely  initiated,  then  film  topics  run  a  gamut  almost  as  wide  as  the  great  Jewish   texts.   From  gay  Chassidic  Jews  in  Trembling  Before  God  to  the  prob  lems  in  Jewish  suburbia  in  Blue  Vinyl  to  Tel  Aviv  twentysomethings  in  Giraffes,  Jewish  film-making  is  blos  soming,  in  part  to  meet  the  demands   of  the  festival  scene.   In  San  Francisco,  for  example,  fes  tival  officials  screen  240  films  a  year,  selecting  about  50  for  the  annual  event,  according  to  executive  direc   tor  Janis  Plotkin.   In  Boston,  Rubin  said  festival  offi  cials  screened  450  films  before  pick  ing  the  final  selections.   But  Sharon  Pucker  Rivo,  executive  director  of  the  National  Centre  for  Jewish  Film  at  Brandeis  University  and  an  associate  professor  of  Jewish  film,  said  there  was  a  down  side  to  the  Jewish  film  explosion.   “Jewish  film  festivals  often  show  films  that  didn’t  make  it  commercial  ly:  either  they’re  really  lousy  films  or  they’re  inaccurate,  historically,”   she  said.   “But  the  imprimatur  of  a  film  festival  gives  it  legitimacy.”   Just  what  makes  a  good  Jewish  film  remains  a  matter  of  dispute:  San  Francisco,  for  instance,  gave  the  thumbs  down  to  the  film  Schmelvis:  Searching  for  the  king’s  Jewish  roots,  while  Toronto  hosted  the  film’s  world  premiere.   Not  all  Jewish  film  festivals  even  list  “outreach”  as  part  of  their  picture.  But  San  Francisco’s,  among  others,  seeks  not  only  to  celebrate  Jewish  “diversity”  but  to  “reach  out  to  the  young  and  unaffiliated”,  Plotkin  said.   In  fact,  she  was  “thrilled”  by  the  outreach  report,  which  “validated”  her  festival  experience.   An  audience  survey  at  last  year’s   San  Francisco  festival  found  that   nearly  60  per  cent  of  the  34,000  patrons  said  they  were  returning  for  the  third  consecutive  year.   A  2001  survey  found  that  five  per  cent  had  been  returning  each  year  for  a  decade  while  30  per  cent  were  new   comers.   Those  results  reflected  what  other   festival  officials  sensed:  they’re  attracting  old  and  new  audiences  who  are  prime  outreach  targets.   In  San  Francisco,  the  2001  survey  found  80  per  cent  of  film-goers  were  Jews,  while  64  per  cent  were  married   to  non-Jews.   “Secular  Jews  come  to  the  Jewish   film  festival  as  it  if  were  their  high  holy  day,  said  Plotkin.

"  Miller’s  Jewish  tragedy,  with  laughs   BROKEN  GLASS   Ensemble  Theatre  until  September  27   Reviewed  by  Peter  Morrison   ARTHUR  Miller  said  Broken  Glass   (the  title  obviously  alluding  to  Kristall  nacht)  is  a  tragic  play,  but  it  contains  a  lot  of  jokes.   He  was  not  wrong,  and  the  Ensem  ble’s  production,  directed  by  one  of  Australia’s  best,  Adam  Cook,  brings  out  the  humour  more  strongly  than  any  staging  this  reviewer  has  seen.   That,  incidentally,  also  applies  to  Ensemble  supremo  Sandra  Bates’  direction  last  year  of  Miller’s  The  Price.   Importantly,  Cook’s  approach  to  Glass,  written  as  recently  as  1994,  when  Miller  was  79,  does  not  in  any  way  diminish  the  dramatic  impact  or   Miller’s  overall  serious  intent.   Some  may  argue  that  Miller  has  been  unkind  in  some  of  his  images  of  the  attitudes  of  some  Jews,  not  exclud  ing  what  might  be  seen  as  paranoia.   But  we  must  surely  accept  his  right  to  paint  aspects  of  humanity  as  he  sees  them,  as  a  Jew  and  one  of  the  world’s  greatest  playwrights.  His  integrity,  compassion,  intellect  and  clarity  of  vision  surely  cannot  be  challenged.   Miller  established  himself  as  a  cre   ator  of  stage  classics  from  1947  until  1955,  with  All  My  Sons,  Death  of  a  Salesman,  The  Crucible  and  View  from  the  Bridge.   Scene  from  Broken  Glass.   His  later  output  was  relatively  checkered,  but  there  were  gems  in  that  lot,  too,  including  The  Price  and  Bro   ken  Glass.   So,  what  is  Glass  about?  Several  issues,  all  intensely  interesting,  some  disturbing  and  the  sum  of  them  both  dramatically  engaging  and  entertain  ing.   It  is  set  in  Brooklyn,  1938.  Phillip,  a  mortgage  company  executive  (Bran  don  Burke)  consults  his  doctor  (Sean  Taylor)  about  his  (Phillip’s)  wife,  Sylvia  (Lynette  Curran)  who  is  bed-ridden,  unable  to  move  her  legs,  although  there  is  no  evidence  of  a  physical  cause.   Why,  then?  She  is  profoundly  dis  turbed  by  reports  in  the  New  York  newspapers  about  the  growing  horror   of  Nazi  persecution;  and  by  the  appar  ent  apathy  of  her  fellow  American  Jews,  not  to  mention  the  US  adminis  tration.   Her  husband  and  the  doctor  share  the  all-too-common  view  that  what  is   happening  in  Germany  is  an  aberra   tion.  It  will  blow  over.   More:  the  relationship  between  Sylvia  and  Phillip  is  far  from  ideal  and  the  problem  goes  back  many  years.  Can  her  hysterical  paralysis  (so  diag  nosed)  be  attributed  to  either  or  both  of  her  problems?   Then  there  is  Phillip’s  deep-seated  insecurity,  his  over-consciousness  of  being  a  Jew  and  of  his  perhaps  precar  ious  position  as  the  only  Jew  ever  employed  by  the  old  establishment  firm  he  works  for.  More  than  a  few  traces  of  self-hatred  and  paranoia   emerge.   This  a  complex  play,  but  thanks  to  Miller’s  genius  and,  at  the  Ensemble,  highest-standard  acting  and  directing,  it  is  also,  if  you’ll  forgive  the  phrase,  crystal  clear.   The  two  major  sources  of  Miller’s  intended  laughs  are  Sylvia’s  caring  sis  ter  (great  comedy  actor  Genevieve  Curran  at  her  best)  and  the  doctor’s  non-Jewish  wife  cum  assistant  (the  less  well-known  but  brilliant  Wendy  Strehlow).  Rounding  off  the  cast  is  Michael  Craig  as  Phillip’s  boss  (not  much  of  a  part,  but  well  played).   Recommendation:  must  see,  but  be  prepared  to  be  both  disturbed  and   amused. ",2003-08-22

"  What  is  the  Jewish  attitude  to  war?   THE  Jewish  greeting  is  shalom   and  our  ideal  is  peace.  In  the  end  of  days  “nation  shall  not  lift  up  sword  against  nation,  nor  shall  they  learn  war  any  more”  (Micah  4:3).   But  believing  in  peace  does  not  require  pacifism.  We  must  seek  peace  and  pursue  it  (Psalm  34:15),   but  an  unredeemed  world  some  times  needs  the  interim  ethic  of  war.  If  peace  talk  is  seen  as  a  sign  of  weak  ness,  there  can  be  a  case  for  resort  ing,  with  immense  reluctance  and  responsibility,  to  war.   But  any  war  must  be  controlled,  contained  and  constrained.  Even  if  necessary,  its  objectives  and  methods  must  be  limited,  the  human  dignity  of  the  enemy  respected  and  the  environment  not  wilfully  devastat  ed.  The  morale  of  the  troops  must  be  protected  and  the  awfulness  of  killing  must  be  acknowledged.   The  rabbis  made  a  seminal  distinction  between  milchemet  mitzvah,  a  “commanded”  or  defen  sive  war,  and  milchemet  reshut,  a  “permitted”  or  voluntary  war.   For  most  of  Diaspora  history,  these  principles  were  probably  unknown  to  Jews  involved  in  mili  tary  activity  in  the  armies  of  other  nations,  though  they  sometimes  reached  high  rank  and  contributed  to  the  history  of  warfare.  But  Eastern  European  Jews  were  more  tradition  al,  and  in  1881  the  Chafetz  Chayyim   ASK  THE  RABBI   RABBI  RAYMOND  APPLE   wrote  a  book  of  halachic  principles  to  guide  Jewish  soldiers  anxious  to  remain  loyal  to  Judaism.  During  World  War  II  the  Jewish  Welfare  Board  of  America  set  out  detailed  answers  to  servicemen’s  questions  as  agreed  by  Orthodox,  Conservative  and  Reform  chaplains.   Israeli  Chief  Rabbi  Shlomo  Goren  and  others  produced  guide  lines  for  the  Israeli  military.  Even  those  not  personally  observant  agree  on  the  ethic  of  military  service  that  has  come  to  be  known  as  “purity  of  arms”.  Proven  infractions  are  subject  to  severe  discipline.   Despite  all  this,  the  Jewish  ideal  remains  the  elimination  of  war  and  the  transformation  of  weapons  into  implements  of  peaceful  construc  tiveness.  “The  world  rests  on  three   things  -  on  justice,  peace  and  truth”  (PirkeiAvot  1:18).  The  Jerusalem  Tal  mud  adds  (Ta’anit  4:2),  “All  three  are  one,  for  where  there  is  justice,  there  is  also  truth  and  peace.”   Rabbi  Mendel  of  Kotzk  said:  “Peace  without  truth  is  a  false  peace.”  He  would  have  said  the  same  thing  about  peace  without  justice.  The  way  to  peace  is  through  justice  and  truth.  Find  the  way  to  justice  and  truth  and  you  will  know  peace.

"  Jewish  MP,  left-wing  groups   express  support  for  Ashrawi  prize   AVIVA  BARD  AND  DAN  GOLDBERG   TWO  left-wing  Jewish  organisa  tions  and  NSW  Greens  MP  Ian  Cohen  -  the  only  Jewish  MP  in  State  Parliament  -  have  spoken  out  in  support  of  the  award  of  the  Syd  ney  Peace  Prize  to  Palestinian  activist  Dr  Hanan  Ashrawi.   “She  should  be  given  the  prize;   she’s  been  a  strident  advocate  of  peace,”  Cohen  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.  “If  anyone  thinks  we’re  going  to  have  peace  without  social  justice,  they’re  deluded.  In  terms  of  the  event,  I’ll  be  there.”   Acknowledging  that  Dr  Ashrawi’s  comments  on  suicide   bombing  were  of  concern  -  they   should  cease  because  “we  do  not  see  results  from  these  actions”,  not  because  they  are  immoral  -  Cohen  said  her  contribution  to  peace  should  be  judged.   “It’s  a  constant  disappointment  to  me  that  the  Sydney  Jewish  com  munity  is  so  narrow-minded.  The  debate  is  far  less  open  and  the  people  here  are  far  less  generous  than  peo  ple  I  communicate  with  in  Israel   “I  condemn  it  [suicide  bomb  ing]  ,  but  understand  the  warped  feet  that  it’s  happening.  Health,  educa  tion  and  quality  of  life  are  the  only  way  to  stop  suicide  bombing.  That’s  what  I  understand  she  is  saying.   “I’m  appalled  at  the  saccharine  campaign  against  her.”   Voicing  similar  support  is  Jews  Against  the  Occupation  -  a  group  which  formed  six  months  ago.   NSW  Greens  MP  Ian  Cohen.   lews  Against  the  Occupation  member  Annie  Pflngst   “I’m  dismayed  at  the  attack  on  her,”  group  member  Annie  Pfingst  said.  “She’s  committed  to  dialogue.   “She  brings  to  the  process  for  peace  a  recognition  of  the  need  to  deal  with  issues  honestly.  Until  there’s  recognition  that  occupation  is  a  major  block  to  peace,  there  isn’t  the  possibility  of  real  movement   “Ashrawi  brings  to  dialogue  an  experience  of  Palestinians  under  occupation.  We  have  to  understand  what  their  conditions  are.   “Because  of  our  experiences  in  the  Holocaust  sometimes  it  seems   not  possible  to  acknowledge  some  one  else’s  suffering,”  she  added.   “It’s  important  to  acknowledge  another  people’s  suffering.  The  only  way  to  resolve  the  conflict  is  through  acknowledgement  and  recognition  on  the  Israeli  side.   Palestinians  have  conceded  that  Israel  exists.  We  should  have  it  in   our  hearts  to  say  this  is  enough”   Melbourne’s  Australian  Jewish  Democratic  Society  (AJDS)  has  slammed  what  it  calls  the  “demonis   ing”  of  Dr  Ashrawi  by  some  mem  bers  of  the  community.   In  a  letter  to  Premier  Bob  Carr,  AJDS  members  Renate  Kamener  and  Steve  Brook  supported  his  decision  to  present  the  prize,  saying  they  “dis  agree  with  tiie  campaign  by  some  in  the  Jewish  community  who  are  demonising  Dr  Ashrawi”.  While  not  necessarily  endorsing  her  selection  for  the  prize,  they  said  they  opposed  the   “unbalanced”  attack  on  her.   In  2001  members  of  the  AJDS  joined  Palestinians  to  protest  Binyamin  Netanyahu’s  visit  to  open  Joseph  Gutnicks  Caulfield  Chabad  House  in  2001  -  two  days  after  the  Jerusalem  bombing  in  which  Mel  boume-born  Malki  Roth  and  14  others  were  killed.

"  PARTISAN   SAM  UPSKI   I  For  Rosenzweigthe   shul  onYom  Kippur   had  indeed  been  the   way  station  to  renewal,  the  beginning  of  a  journey.   JUST  90  years  ago,  on  Yom  Kippur   1913,  Franz  Rosenzweig  went  to  an  Orthodox  shul  in  Berlin.  The  worshippers  seeking  forgiveness   through  their  prayers  moved  him  profoundly.  As  anniversaries  go  in  the  history  of  20th-century  Judaism,  it  is  worth  more  than  a  passing  mention.   So  if  it  were  not  so  improbable  a  title,  I  might  have  called  this  column,  “A  tale  of  two  Franzs”  -  Kafka  and  Rosenzweig.   Now  everybody's  heard  of  Kafka,  even  if  they  haven’t  read  him.  He  even  has  a  word,  “Kafkaesque”.  But  Rosenzweig?  Somehow  “Rosen  zweigesque”  doesn’t  work.  Outside  of  those  with  a  particular  interest  in  20th-century  Jewish  thought,  he’s  hardly  known  at  all.   So  why  write  about  him?  I  could  say  that  Franz  Rosenzweig  has  been  cited  as  the  most  influential  -  and  complex  -  Jewish  philosopher  theologian  of  the  20th  century,  a   non-rabbi  who  has  influenced  more  rabbis,  particularly  non-Orthodox  rabbis,  than  anybody  else.   But  as  others  will  want  to  nomi   nate  Mordechai  Kaplan,  Abraham  Joshua  Heschel,  Joseph  Soloveitchik  or  Avraham  Yitzchak  Kook,  I  won’t  offer  that  as  the  sole  explanation.   No,  it’s  really  because  on  the  Shab  bat  before  Rosh  Hashanah,  Geoff  Garber,  a  fellow  congregant  in  Mel  bourne’s  Kehilat  Nitzan,  led  an  inter  esting  shiur  in  which  he  referred  to  Rosenzweig’s  classic  work,  The  Star  Of  Redemption.   Then,  serendipitously,  in  last  week’s  AJN  Rosh  Hashanah  maga  zine,  Monash  University’s  Dr  Michael  Fagenblat  nominated  Franz  Kafka  as  one  of  his  favourite  charac  ters  in  modem  Judaism  and  present  ed  the  intriguing  argument  that  Rosh   Hashanah  was  Kafka’s  festival   “Intriguing”  because  the  extract  from  Franz  Kafka’s  Letter  To  His  Father,  which  Dr  Fagenblatt  coinci  dentally  also  showed  me  last  week,  suggests  that  Kafka  detested  shul,  and  that  the  high  holy  days  bored,  even  disgusted,  him.  Even  more  starkly,  in  In  Our  Synagogue,  a  short  story,  Kafka  depicts  God  as  a  strange,  capri  cious  beast  that  lives  in  shul,  feared  only  by  the  women,  and  to  whom  the   men  are  indifferent   Nevertheless,  I  can  still  accept  Dr  Fagenblatt’s  notion  that  Kafka’s  estrangement  from  his  tradition  is  both  sad  and  funny,  and  that  many  modem  Jews  can  readily  identify   with  it   While  I  recognised  Dr  Fagenblatfs   Franz,  it  made  me  think  about  the   other  Franz,  who  grappled  with  many  of  the  same  dilemmas  and  demons,  but  who  ended  up  in  another  place.   Of  course,  there  are  explanations  for  their  differences.  But  whatever  those  explanations,  Kafka  made  his  impact  on  western  culture  as  the  quintessential  Jewish  outsider,  the  marginal  man.  But  he  left  no  lasting  imprint  on  Jewish  thought.  But  Rosenzweig’s  impact  on  Jewish  thought  once  he  became  an  insider  has  been  magisterial   The  “other”  Franz  was  the  son  of  a   cultured,  assimilated  Jewish  family  in  pre-World  War  I  Germany.  A  bril  liant  student  struggling  with  moder  nity  and  a  vague  Jewishness,  he  was  about  to  convert  to  Christianity.  But  then  he  had  his  Yom  Kippur  epiphany.  He  no  longer  had  to  seek  salvation  outside  his  own  tradition.  He  had  begun  his  journey  home.   First  came  learning  and  intellectu  al  discovery.  Within  four  years  he  was  writing  some  of  The  Star  Of  Redemp  tion  in  the  form  of  postcards  sent  from  the  trenches  of  World  War  I  during  1917,  while  serving  in  the  German  Army.   But  he  was  not  today's  conven   tional“chozerbitshuvah&gt;&gt;  (returner  in  repentance)  who  finds  faith  and  at  once  becomes  “frum”.  In  fact,  Franz  Rosenzweig’s  return  journey  contin  ued  until  his  death  in  1929  at  43.   A  paralysing  illness  for  his  last  eight  years  meant  he  could  write  only  on  a  special  typewriter.  He  pointed  to  each  letter  with  a  finger  or  his  eyes,  while  his  wife  typed  the  manuscripts.  Despite  this  disability,  he  wrote  prolifically,  lec  tured  and  translated  large  sections  of  the  Bible  (with  Martin  Buber)  and  all  ofYehuda  Halevi’s  poetry.   Gradually  his  return  journey  also  involved  adopting  ritual  command  ments,  one  day  expecting  he  would  become  fully  observant  When  some  one  asked  whether  he  put  on  tefillin,  he  replied  “Not  yet”   It  was  a  typical  answer.  For  Rosen  zweig  the  shul  on  Yom  Kippur  had  indeed  been  the  way  station  to  renewal,  the  beginning  of  a  journey.  Unless  I  have  misread  him,  Kafka  saw  shul  on  Rosh  Hashanah  as  the  last  station  on  the  track.  So  this  Yom  Kip  pur  it’s  Franz  Rosenzweig,  rather  than  Franz  Kafka,  who  comes  to  mind,  and  heart   Sam  Lipski  is  a  former  editor  of  the  AJN.   His  column  appears  monthly.

Every  child,  from  Year  3  onwards,  is   expected  to  own  and  use  a  personal  copy  of  Tanakh  as  an  on-going  resource  for   exploring  Judaism.  As  the  students  move  to  more  senior  years,  Rabbinic  and   contemporaiy  Jewish  text,  including  Internet  resources  inform  their  learning.   Students  are  consciously  invited  to  develop  an  honest  and  healthy  relationship  to   Judaism.  Students  have  the  right  to  express  freely  their  informed  opinions  about  their   perceptions  of  Jewish  identity.

"  JEWISH  OLYMPIANS   AN  English  Olympic  historian  sug  gests  in  a  book  that  had  Jews  compet  ed  as  a  nation  in  the  first  modern  Olympics  in  1896,  they  would  have  finished  fourth  in  the  medal  count.   Paul  Yogi  Mayer  reveals  in  Jews  and  the  Olympic  Games  that  the  nine  medals  won  by  the  Jewish  competi  tors  from  44  events  in  Athens  1896  would  have  placed  them  as  a  nation  ahead  of  France  and  Germany.   These  facts  were  highlighted  by  the  Jewish  Telegraph  (Manchester)   last  month.   It  reports  that  German-born   Mayer,  92,  was  one  of  the  Jewish  ath  letes  banned  by  Hitler  from  compet  ing  at  the  1936  Berlin  games.  With  his  wife  and  baby,  they  fled  Germany  and  settled  in  England  in  May  1939.  He  joined  the  British  Army  and  vol  unteered  for  the  Special  Operation   Executive.   He  became  youth  director  of  the  [Jewish]  Brady  Clubs  and  continued  a  journalistic  career.  He  established  the  Primrose  Jewish  Youth  Club  to  help  absorb  young  Jews  who  had  sur  vived  the  Holocaust  and  received  the  MBE  in  recognition  of  his  services  to  youth.   According  to  the  Jewish  Telegraph,  Mayer  wrote  the  book  “to  present  the  achievements  of  Jews  at  the  Olympics  for  the  inspiration  of  the  young  in  order  to  oppose  anti  semitism  wherever  it  is  manifested...  sport  can  serve  as  a  springboard  towards  the  emancipation  of  all  minority  groups,  as  I  believe  it  has  been  for  the  minority  to  which  I  belong”.   Mayer  says  that  just  before  the  1936  Olympics,  he  wrote  about  Jews  in  sport  and  published  lists  of  Jewish  champions  of  the  time  in  The  Jewish  Sportsbook.  In  2000  he  penned  another  book  to  assist  those  involved  in  research  on  German  Jews  before  the  Berlin  games.   MIKE  GOLLAND   Sydney,  NSW ",2004-08-27

"  JEWISH  VIEWS   STEPHEN  Rothman  apparently  is  now  in  the  business  of  trademarking  the  word  “Jewish”.   He  contends  (AJN  18/6/04)  that  the  Australian  Jewish  Democratic  Society  has  no  right  to  present  itself  as  a  “Jewish”  organisation  or  as  having  a  “Jewish  viewpoint”.   He  offers  two  reasons:  the  AJDS  is  only  a  small  minority  group  within  the  Australian  Jewish  community,  and  its  views  diverge  from  the  latter’s   “overwhelming  view”   Whether  taken  separately  or  together,  these  reasons  constitute  a  bad,  even  dangerous,  argument.   If  minority  membership  is  defin  itive,  most  Jewish  organisations  will  need  to  scrub  “Jewish”  from  their  letterheads.   If  divergence  from  the  main  stream  view  is  what  denies  entitle  ment  to  self-identification,  then  heaven  help  minority  groups  like  Australian  Jews,  who  wish  to  be  considered  Australian  just  like  the  overwhelmingly  Christian  majority.   Was  it  not  One  Nation  that   insisted  that  Australian  meant  being   Christian?   We  have  a  way  of  accommodat  ing  Rothman  s  concern  that  works  perfectly  fine:  we  distinguish  between  “representative/unrepre   sentative”  or  “official/unofficial”   views.

"  Playing  Spot  the  Jew   BEYOND  WORDS   RUTH  WAJNRYB   I  In  Spot  the  Jew,  the  less   likely  (more   camouflaged?)   examples  of  Jews   produce  the  bigger  thrill.  Actors  with  non-Jewish  names  (acquired)  stay  camouflaged  for  longer  -  Kirk  Douglas  was  Izzy  Demskyjony  Curtis  was   I  Bemie  Schwartz.   THERE’S  a  game  we  all  play  -  it’s   called  Spot  the  Jew.  A  jokey  ver   sion  is:   Jew  1:  “Have  you  heard  that  X  is  Jewish?”   Jew  2:  “No!  Not  X!  You’re  kidding!  Really?  How  did  you  find  out?”   Jew  1:  “I  read  it  in  (heard  it  from,  saw  it  on)...”   Jew  2:  “Jesus!  Really?  Imagine  that!”  The  American  version  is  Locate  the  Landsman,  where  landsman  translates  roughly  as  “a  member  of  our  tribe”.  For  reasons  that  we  don’t  usually  contemplate,  we  seem  to  enjoy  uncovering  fellow  Jews,  though  it  has  to  be  said  that  in  nature  and  purpose,  this  is  wholly  different  from  the  gay  “outing”.   Our  enjoyment  is  doubtless  con  nected  to  being  a  minority  communi  ty.  You  couldn’t  imagine  Anglo-Australians  playing  Spot  the  Anglo-Australian.  And  I  bet  Italians,  Greeks,  Armenians,  Argentineans  etc.  all  play  a  version  of  the  game  -  a  kind  of  spot  the  paisan  (or  equivalent).   However,  I  suspect  the  Jewish  ver  sion  is  slightly  more  piquant  precisely  because  of  the  history-driven  tenu  ousness  of  our  community  's  relation  ship  with  its  “hosts”.   In  Spot  the  Jew,  the  less  likely  (more  camouflaged?)  examples  of  Jews  produce  the  bigger  thrill.  Actors  with  non-Jewish  names  (acquired)  stay  camouflaged  for  longer  -  Kirk  Douglas  was  Izzy  Demsky,  Tony  Cur   tis  was  Bernie  Schwartz.   And  of  course,  actors,  producers,  journalists,  professors  and  scientists  don’t  have  the  same  thrill  value  as  Jews  discovered  to  be  in  those  domains  not  usually  associated  with  Jewishness.   Who’s  not  surprised  to  hear  of  Jewish  Olympic  athletes  or  Jewish   army  generals?  (What  kind  of  job  is  that  for  a  nice  Jewish  boy?)   One  reason  we  play  the  game  is  emotional.  It’s  a  thumb-nosing:  see,  world,  what  we  can  do,  even  after  you’ve  beaten  us  down,  chased  us  out  of  our  homes,  forced  us  to  go  to  new  shores,  we’ve  still  managed  to  recoup  and  come  up  with  the  goods.  So   there.   There’s  also  a  migration  demo  graphic  element  —  how  outsiders  manage  to  survive  in  a  new  society.  If  you’re  fearful  that  you  won’t  get  through  the  employment  gate  keeper,  you  go  create  your  own  business,  where  you  work  harder  than  anyone  ever  did  for  an  employer.   And  you  go  into  fields  where  your  origins  won’t  be  held  against  you  -  Hollywood  success  is  by  box  office,  not  birth.  When  you  go  into  an  area  where  Jews  are  not  welcomed  or  con  sidered  ill  equipped,  then  you  try  harder,  and  often  succeed  harder.   As  for  those  fields  in  which  Jews  were  rarely  participants  -  the  athletic,  the  military,  the  criminal  -  there’s  a  particular  relish  in  discovering  that  one  of  us  has  made  it.  Even  Jewish  gangsters  (“tough  Jews”)  have  a  retro  spective  romantic  appeal  for  their,  well,  gutsiness.   No  doubt,  there’s  a  Spot  the  Jew  factor  in  the  number  of  internet  web  sites  offering  lists  of  Jews.   Some  of  these  sites  (e.g.  www.jew  hoo.com)  are  devised  by  Jews  and  one  can  only  assume  they’re  collectors,  the  way  people  collect  miniature  dolls  or  antique  furniture.   Others  are  produced  by  non-Jews  and  these  can  generate  an  uneasy  post  Holocaustal  creepiness.  Think:  local  mayor  compliantly  (gleefully?)  hands  over  list  of  town’s  Jews  to  occupying   Nazis.  You  have  to  wonder:  are  there   listings  called  Cathhoo,  Buddhoo  or   Mushoo?   Clearly,  intention  is  primary  If  it’s  a  tribal  pride  in  achievement,  then  listing  Jews  as  Jews  may  be  valid.  If  it’s  to  show  Jews  control  the  world,  then  it’s  not.  But  even  intention  has  to  be  considered  in  a  larger  context.  An  “outing”  may  not  be  intended,  but  may  still  result.   Reading  the  lists  makes  you  ques  tion  -  when  is  a  Jew  a  Jew?  Why  make  a  point  of  flagging  converts  and  part  Jews?  Why  include  Karl  Marx,  the  classic  self-hating  antisemite  whose  own  statements  about  Jews  read  like  extracts  from  Mein  Kampf?  And  would  Noam  Chomsky  want  his   name  on  a  Jew  list?  Come  to  think  of  it,  do  we  want  it  there?   Fame  is  one  thing,  notoriety  another.  Who  doesn’t  cringe  when  the  mainstream  news  breaks  with  a  Jew  related  scandal?  A  friend  of  mine  recently  wrote  to  the  Australian  fol  lowing  an  article  on  a  certain  Russian  billionaire:  “I  found  your  article  (21/8)  disturbing  for  two  reasons.  The  first  is  that  this  man  is  obviously  a  sleazoid  who  has  swindled  Russia  out  of  billions.  The  second,  is  that  you  saw  fit  to  describe  his  maternal   KRPN  grandparents  as  Jewish.   “I  wonder  whether  this  is  because   of  a  new  policy  of  your  paper  to  give  the  religion  of  all  maternal  grandpar  ents  of  all  people  featured  in  your  paper.  If  so,  I  did  not  notice  this  in  relation  to  anyone  else  in  today’s   edition.   “Would  you  have  given  their  reli  gion  if  they  were  Orthodox  or  Presby  terian?  Would  you  have  given  their  religion  if  he  was  not  a  sleazoid,  but  a  saintly  man  who  had  done  many  good  deeds?   “I  am  all  for  giving  details  of  peo  ple’s  background  when  it  adds  some  thing  of  substance.  However,  it  is  hard  to  see  your  actions  as  other  than  say  ing  that,  by  the  way,  this  thoroughly  unwholesome  person  is  Jewish.”   He  signed  the  letter  “Yours  disap  pointedly”.

"  Why  would  an  Aboriginal  woman  decide  to  convert  to  Judaism?   JACQUI  GAL  meets  Dr  Lisa  Jackson  Pulver,  who  says  she  has  been  able  to  learn  more  about  who  she  is  as  an  Aboriginal  through  her  practice  of  Judaism.   “Look  at  people  like   [NSW  Chief]  Justice   [Jim]  Spigelman  going  on  the  freedom  rides.   Those  guys  could  have  been  killed  on  that  bus  but  that  didn't  deter  them.  I  have  always   seen  Jews  stand  up  [for  Aboriginal  rights].”   DR  USA  JACKSON  PUUflER  Aboriginal  convert  to  Judaism   EVERY  Friday,  after  a  busy   working  week,  Dr  Lisa  Jackson  Pulver  doses  the  front  door  of  her  Newtown   home,  in  Sydney’s  inner  suburbs,  and  begins  kneading  dough   to  make  challah.   Lighting  her  Shabbat  candles,  Dr  Jackson  Pulver,  a  member  of  the  Wirajuri  people,  welcomes  “the  quiet  zone”  that  is  her  home  for  25  sacred  hours.   But  Dr  Jackson  Pulver  wasn’t  bom  into  Judaism;  it  was  her  choosing.   “I  was  brought  up  in  a  Christian  environment;  my  father  was  Catholic,  my  mother  was  Church  of  England.   “In  the  early  years  my  sister  and  I  did  Bible  study  and  we  went  to  Sun  day  school.  I  always  had  difficulty  with  this  baby  Jesus  perception.  He  was  this  blue-eyed,  white-skinned  person  who  wanted  to  convert  black  people.   “And  what  I  realised  was  that  Jesus  was  a  Jew  and  not  many  Jews  that  I  had  met  -  not  that  I  had  met  very  many  -  were  blue-eyed  and  white  skinned,”  says  Dr  Jackson  Pulver.   “What  I  also  realised  was  that  the  priests,  ministers  and  other  religious  leaders  in  our  community  behaved  very  badly  and  would  say  bad  things  about  my  grandmother  and  our  peo  ple,  when  they  were  supposed  to  be  delivering  faith.   “I  also  found  it  difficult  having  to  go  through  a  middle  man  to  connect   with  God.  I  also  had  trouble  with  the   concept  of  the  Holy  Trinity,”  she  says.   “In  those  days  you  were  expected  to  hide  yourself  and  when  my  grand  mother  came  to  pick  us  up  it  was   obvious  that  we  weren’t  what  we   seemed  and  it  changed  the  way  peo  ple  saw  us.  It  was  horrible.”   Growing  up,  Dr  Jackson  Pulver  began  looking  at  “other  paths”.   “I  knew  that  there  was  a  great  spir   Dr  Jackson  Pulver  sews  klppas  with  fabric  designed  by  Northern  Territory  Aboriginal   artists.   it,”  she  says.  “And  in  the  Aboriginal  culture  there’s  a  great  monotheistic  being  that  created  the  land  and  from  there  came  the  animals  and  the  people.”   A  chance  meeting  in  Surry  Hills  seven  years  ago  brought  Dr  Jackson  Pulver  one  step  closer  to  Judaism.   “I  met  a  guy,  one  of  those  black  hat  fellas,  he  sort  of  looked  lost.  He  had  the  side-locks  and  spoke  in  a  funny  accent  and  everything  about   him  was  different”   Helping  the  man  to  find  the  address  he  was  seeking,  Dr  Jackson  Pulver  asked  him,  “Where  are  you   from?”   The  pair  struck  up  a  conversation  and  Dr  Jackson  Pulver  attended  a  lec  ture  he  was  giving  on  Torah,  mysti  cism  and  Judaism.   “I  found  it  really  interesting  and  I   wanted  to  learn  more  about  it  so  he  gave  me  the  names  of  some  books.  I  went  to  Dymocks,  but  they  didn’t   have  them.”   A  few  years  later  she  travelled  to  Jordan  for  short-term  employment.   “The  first  opportunity  I  had,  I  hopped  across  the  border  to  Jerusalem  and  went  to  find  those  books,”  recalls  Dr  Jackson  Pulver.   “When  I  started   observing  Shabbat  it   was  the  first  time  in  my  life  where  there  was  a   total  and  utter  consent  to  do  nothing  for  25  hours.”   DR  USA  JACKSON  PUU/ER   1  Aboriginal  convert  to  Judaism   “It  introduced  me  to  a  depth  that  was  beyond  the  rhetoric  of  religion  and  beyond  the  superficial  practice.   “When  I  came  back  I  was  involved   with  the  reconciliation  process  and  met  some  stunning  Jewish  people,  including  Mark,  who  is  now  my   husband.”   As  a  self-described  “angry  young  woman”,  Dr  Jackson  Pulver  says  that  Judaism  naturally  spoke  to  her.   “I  was  involved  with  a  lot  of  the   land-rights  marches.  And  I  came  across  a  lot  of  Jews  who  were  in  the  rank  and  file.  I  was  always  impressed  by  their  ability  to  stand  with  us.  You  would  have  thought  that  after  World  War  II,  they’d  want  some  peace  in  this  country.   “But  look  at  people  like  [NSW  Chief]  Justice  [Jim]  Spigelman  going  on  the  freedom  rides.  Those  guys  could   have  been  killed  on  that  bus  but  that   didn’t  deter  them.  I  have  always  seen  Jews  stand  up  and  say  that’s  not  okay.   “And  it  was  an  Aboriginal  man  who  went  to  Canberra,  concerned  about  what  was  happening  to  the   Dr  Lisa  Jackson  Pulver...  bom  on  the  land  of  the  Cadlgal  people,  she  converted  to  Judaism  last  year.   Jews  in  Europe  in  World  War  II,  and  put  forward  a  motion  that  they   should  come  here.  I  think  from  that  perspective  we  have  a  lot  in  common.   But  there  are  real  differences.”   IN  2001  Dr  Lisa  Jackson  and  Mark   I  Pulver  were  married  in  a  civil  serv  iice  by  an  Aboriginal  preacher,  which  included  an  Aboriginal  smok  ing  ceremony  and  Jewish  rituals.   “Mark  insisted  we  get  married  under  a  chuppah  and  that  he  break  a  glass.  I  thought  it  was  funny  that  for  someone  who  said  religion  is  not  important  in  his  life,  it  mattered  to   him  so  much  that  we  do  that”   Dr  Jackson  Pulver  began  attending  Newtown  Synagogue  and  approached  the  Sydney  Beth  Din  to  convert  She  completed  the  process  a  few  days  prior  to  Rosh  Hashanah  last  year.  A  week  later  the  couple  had  a  second  wedding  ceremony  at  Newtown  shul.   “When  I  started  observing  Shab  bat  it  was  the  first  time  in  my  life  where  there  was  a  total  and  utter  con  sent  to  do  nothing  for  25  hours.   “Friday  afternoon  I  stop  every  thing,  make  challah  and  once  the  can  dles  are  lit  my  friends  know  -  don’t  bother  calling,  because  I  won’t  answer.  Come  over  here  and  play  if  you  like,  there’s  always  plenty  of  food,  but  my  house  goes  into  quiet  zone.”   Last  week  Dr  Jackson  Pulver’s  family  hosted  some  of  her  family   from  Adelaide  for  Shabbat   “They  love  helping  light  the  can  dles  and  say  the  blessings  for  the  wine  and  the  challah.  It’s  like  the  way  we   used  to  have  Christmas  but  we  have  it  every  week.   “People  always  ask  me  about  a  conflict  between  my  Aboriginally  and  my  Judaism  and  I  say  there’s  no   conflict  whatsoever.  I  often  get  sur-  v  prised  at  how  people  like  to  generalise  about  Aboriginal  people,  as  I  do  about  how  people  enjoy  generalising  about  Jews.  There’s  diversity  in  my   communities  and  that  should  never   be  forgotten.   “People  sometimes  say  to  me,  ‘Why  would  you  convert  to  Judaism,  don’t  you  have  enough  trouble  in  your  life?’   “But  I  feel  I  satisfied  in  my  practice   and  it’s  a  way  that  makes  sense  to  me  ;  to  express  aspects  of  my  spiritual  understanding.   “I  feel  as  though  I  have  been  able   to  learn  more  about  who  I  am  as  an   Aboriginal  woman  through  my  prac  tice  of  Judaism.  And  that  for  me  is  a  sacred  dreaming.”   Dr  Lisa  Jackson  Pulver  was  bom  on  the   land  of  the  Cadigal  people.

"  GREEN,  AND  JEWISH   PETER  Kohn,  in  his  article  “Green,  blue  and  white”  (AJN  10/9),  implies  that  there  are  only  a  “small  number  of  Jews”  in  the  Greens.  In  fact  there  are  quite  a  number.  Three  of  the  13  mem  bers  of  the  current  Victorian  State  Executive  are  Jews,  as  are  10  per  cent  of  the  State  Council.  Other  Jewish  mem  bers  are  active  in  working  groups  and  campaigns.  Few,  if  any,  of  these  mem  bers  would  be  in  the  party  if  they  believed  that  Greens  policies  were  detrimental  to  the  survival  of  Israel.  On  the  contrary,  they  believe  that  the  ongoing  cycle  of  reprisals  and  counter  reprisals  has  made  Israel  less  safe.  They  do  not  believe  that  the  exercise  of  force  can  produce  a  solution.   A  fundamental  tenet  of  the  Greens  is  the  principle  of  non-violent  resolu  tion  of  political  conflict  If  Kohn  is  dis  turbed  that  our  opposition  to  suicide  bombings  is  only  mentioned  once  in   Greens  policy,  he  should  read  Bob  Brown's  speech  to  the  Senate  debate  on  proscribing  Hamas  (7/11/03)  in  which  he  unequivocally  condemned   such  acts  of  terrorism.   Contrary  to  some  misconceptions,  the  Greens  clearly  advocate  a  two-state  solution  that  will  ensure  both  security  and  justice  for  both  peoples.  So  while  the  Greens  position  is  certainly  very   different  to  that  of  the  Sharon  Govern  ment,  it  is  closely  aligned  with  that  of  the  Israeli  peace  movement,  and  shows  a  striking  similarity  to  the  Geneva   Accord.  This  accord  was  achieved   between  Israelis  and  Palestinians  nego  tiating  in  good  faith  and  aware  of  their  responsibilities.  It  has  been  endorsed  by  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  Israeli  population,  as  well  as  Bill  Clin  ton,  Bob  Hawke  and  Malcolm  Fraser.

"  REFLECTION   Jewish  New  Year  resolutions   Humourist   Vanny  Katz   makes  plans  for  the  forthcoming   year.   B  ewish  New  Year  is  nothing  like  non   fl  Jewish  New  Year:  it’s  not  a  big  partying,   B  drinking,  staying-up-past-midnight  kind  f  of  thing  -  nobody’s  dancing  on  the  table,  singing  “Tonight  I’m  gonna  party  like  it  was  5765.”  No,  it’s  a  more  low-key  affair  where  families  get  together,  have  a  nice  meal,  dip  a  bit  of  apple  in  honey,  and  then  sit  around  staring  at  each  other,  thinking,  “So  what  now?”  —  for  that  reason,  I’ve  always  felt  it  should  be  called  Jewish  Nu?Year.   So  because  it’s  not  a  big  extravagant  kind  of  day,  my  Jewish  New  Year’s  resolutions  are  not  going  to  be  big  and  extravagant  either;  I’m  not  vowing  to  lose  weight,  or  be  a   better  husband,  or  travel  to  Guinea-Bissau   and  help  poor,  starving  villagers  by  teaching  them  a  few  newspaper-column-writing  skills.  No,  I’m  just  going  for  small,  easily   attainable  stuff  this  year,  so  here  are  my  10   Rosh  Hashanah  resolutions.   ONE:  I  vow  to  stop  being  such  a  bagel   tyrant:  no  more  will  I  force  people  to  only  put   cream  cheese  and  smoked  salmon  on  their   bagels  —  from  now  on,  they  can  put  avocado  on  their  bagels  if  they  want,  or  strawberry   jam  on  their  bagels,  or  even  peanut  butter  on  their  bagels,  although  just  the  act  of  writing   the  words  “peanut  butter”  and  “bagels”  in  the  same  sentence  is  making  me  dry  heave.  I  will,  however,  continue  to  smack  anyone   who  even  THINKS  about  usingVegemite.   I’ve  been  out  of  control  on  the  booze  lately,  drinking  anything  up  to  four  or  five  sips  of  Bailey’s  Irish  Cream  every  second  Saturday  night.   TWO:  I  promise  to  finally  use  the  Hebrew  Alphabet  Cookie-Cutter  Set  that  my  Aunty  Zena  sent  from  Canada  30  years  ago  -  but   I’ve  decided  not  to  use  the  tub  of   homemade  cookie  batter  that  came  with  it.  THREE:  I’m  going  to  write  up  that  great  idea  for  a  TV  series  about  a  bunch  of   crime-solving  Chassids  who  listen  to  rap  music  (note:  must  write  myself  in  as  MC  Snoop  Doggy  Katz).   FOUR:  I  vow  to  stop  feeling  uncomfortable  about  buying  the  normal  cocktail  franks   from  the  local  delicatessen  -  as  a  Jewish  man,  I’ve  always  felt  this  ridiculous  obligation  to  buy  the  ones  that  say  “skin  off”.   FIVE:  This  year  I’m  determined  to  find  out  if  my  father  is  really  entided  to  claim  the   “afikomen  ransom”  from  Passover  as  a  tax  deduction.   SIX:  I’m  going  to  continue  my  noble   quest  to  become  the  first  Jewish  alcoholic  in  history:  I’ve  been  out  of  control  on  the  booze  lately,  drinking  anything  up  to  FOUR  or  FIVE  sips  of  Bailey’s  Irish   Cream  every  second  Saturday  night.  And  last  Tuesday  I  actually  managed  to  finish  a  WHOLE  GLASS  OF  BEER,  although  I   did  have  to  sweeten  it  up  with  lemonade  -  enough  lemonade  so  that  it  tasted  like  creaming  soda.   SEVEN:  I  vow  to  finally  stop  singing   annoying  parodies  of  pop  songs  based  on   the  word  “Jew”:  I’m  going  to  stop  singing   Elton  John’s  “Jew  eyes,  baby’s  got  Jew  eyes.”   And  no  more  will  I  belt  out  a  heartfelt   rendition  of  Olivia  Newton-John’s  “I  love  Jew,  I  honesdy  love  Jew.”  But  I  will  never  EVER  stop  singing  Diana  Ross  and  The  Supremes’“Shtup!  In  the  name  of  love.”  EIGHT:  And  for  my  eighth  and  final   resolution  in  my  list  of  10,  this  year  I  vow   to  be  a  litde  more  ambitious.

"  Proudly  black  and  Jewish   BLACKS  have  no  anthropological  imperative  to  claim  a  Jewish  iden  tity,  said  Jewish  scholar  Graenum  Berger  when  asked  about  black   Jews.   What  would  he  have  done  when  confronted  by  blacks  in  Nigeria,  Uganda,  Zimbabwe  and  other  places  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  who  are  re-evaluating  their  heritage  through  a  Jewish  prism?   What  would  he  have  said  about  the  communities  in  India,  South-East  Asia  and  Peru?  And  what  would  he  have  thought  about  DNA  studies  which  find  genetic  connections  between  Jews  and  people  in  places  where  there  have  never  been  recorded  com  munities?   The  Shalom  Institute’s  upcom  ing  eight-week  Mosaic  program  on  “Neither  Ashkenazi  or  Sephar  di:  Communities  on  the  Edge  of  the  Jewish  World”  will  examine  these  and  other  issues  surround  ing  communities  which  don’t  fit  into  the  generally-accepted  per  ceptions  of  Jews.

"  Greens’  first  Jewish  senator?   MICHAEL  CAVANAGH   EVEN  though  he  could  well  be  the  only  Jewish  senator  after  October  9,  Greens  for  the  Senate  John  Kaye  accepts  that  many  fellow-Jews  disagree   with  his  stand  on  various  issues.   Melboume-bom  Kaye  occupies  the  party’s  number  one  spot  on  its  NSW  Senate  ticket,  giving  the  lecturer  a  strong  chance  of  entering  parliament   He  is  the  fourth  Jewish  candidate  in  the  election,  after  incumbent  Member  for  Melbourne  Ports  Michael  Danby  (Labor);  Danby’s  Liberal  Party  chal  lenger,  David  Southwick;  and  David  Ritter  (Labor),  who  is  contesting  the   West  Australian  seat  of  Pearce.   Green  policies  on  the  Middle  East,  defence  and  education  all  have  the  potential  to  alienate  Kaye,  49,  from  members  of  the  Jewish  community.   His  party  is  “telling  the  truth  here”,  he  insists,  and  he  is  willing  to  accept  the  consequences.  “We  have  always  taken  a  stand,”  he  says.  “We  listen  to  people,  but  in  the  end  we  have  to  do  what  we  believe  is  right.”   The  recent  bombings  in  Beersheva  which  left  16  dead  “again  highlight  the  tragedy  of  a  conflict  where  it  is  inno  cent  civilians  who  pay  the  price  for  the  failure  of  the  peace  process”,  he  added.   A  Melbourne  University-trained  engineer,  with  postgraduate  work  at  the  University  of  California  and  ANU,  Kaye  said  peace  would  be  achieved  only  if  there  were  separate  Israeli  and   Palestinian  states.   “I  was  brought  up  as  a  Jew  with  the  story  of  the  Holocaust  and  the  Exodus.   iohn  Kaye...  “We  would  take  away  all  the  money  from  wealthier  schools,  regardless  of  religious  orientation.  Ybur  readership  won’t  like  that,  but  that’s  the  reality.”   That  led  me  to  a  commitment  to  peo  ple  who  were  dispossessed,  people  who  don’t  have  a  homeland,  people  who  are  victimised,  individuals  who  are  not  allowed  self-determination.  That’s  where  my  heart  lies.   “Leaving  aside  the  Palestinian  lead   ership  and  the  violence,  the  average  Palestinian  is  getting  a  raw  deal.”   Israel’s  security  fence  will  “entrench  the  bitterness”  and  make  it  more  diffi  cult  to  find  peace,  Kaye  added.   He  described  the  US-Australia   alliance  as  being  “out  of  kilter”,  with   ramifications  for  Canberra’s  relations   with  countries  throughout  the  region.   “The  idea  that  Australia  describes   itself  as  Deputy  Sheriff  is  dangerous  and  immoral.  It  reduces  our  ability  to  engage  with  neighbouring  nations  and  it’s  immoral  because  we  have  an  obli  gation  to  make  our  own  decisions.”   Educated  at  Scotch  College  in  Mel  bourne,  Kaye  is  a  strong  supporter  of  public  education.

"  Number-one  Google   result  for  ‘Jew’  is  hate  site   JOE  ESKENAZI   SAN  FRANCISCO  -  Online   searchers  typing  the  word  “Jew”  into  the  Google  search  engine  may  be  surprised  at  the  results  they  get.   In  fact,  the  number-one  result  for  the  search  entry  “Jew”  turns  out  to  be  www.jewwatch.com,  a  fanati  cally  antisemitic  hate  site  which  is   ranked  first  in  relevance  of  more  than  1.72  million  web  pages.   Google,  like  other  online  search  engines,  is  utilised  by  web  users  to   locate  information  on  the  internet.   Typing  “George  W  Bush”,  for  example,  yields  more  than  four  mil   lion  sites.   The  number-one  ranking  of  Jew  Watch  came  as  a  surprise  to  David  Krane,  the  director  of  corporate  communications  for  the  San  Mateo-based  web  giant.   Such  a  page  might  not  pop  up   for  Google  searchers  in  European  countries,  where  Holocaust  denial  is  illegal.  But  Krane  said  that  Google  has  no  plans  to  manually  alter  the  results  of  their  ranking  system  to  knock  Jew  Watch  from  its  top  spot.   “No,  we  don’t  do  that.  Google  merely  reflects  what  is  on  the  web  and  does  its  best  to  algorithmically  rank  pages.  Unless  [a  web  page]  vio  lates  a  country  or  local  law,  we  don’t  make  any  tweaks,”  he  said.   While  Google  will  not  alter  the  results  of  its  own  search  engine,  Krane  promised  to  alert  the  firm’s  engineers  to  further  refine  the  search  algorithm,  which  might  alter  the  findings  for  the  term  “Jew”.   He  invited  users  concerned  about  search  results  to  contact   help@google.com.  User  feedback  is  fed  directly  to  engineers,  he  said.

"  Russia  names  Jewish  prime  minister   LEV  KRICHEVSKY   MOSCOW  -  The  Jewish  man  named  as  Russia’s  new  prime  minister  is  lit  tle  known  to  the  country’s  Jewish  community.   But  Jewish  leaders  welcomed  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin’s  selection  this  week  of  Mikhail  Frad   kov,  currently  Russia’s  envoy  to  the  European  Union  in  Brussels.   Jewish  leaders  said  Fradkov,  who  was  expected  to  be  approved  by  the  pro-Putin  majority  in  the  Russian  parliament  later  this  week,  has  had  no  interaction  with  the  organised  Jewish  community.   If  approved,  Fradkov  would  be  the  first  identified  Jew  to  serve  as  Russia’s  prime  minister.  His  father  is  known  to  be  Jewish,  and  while  the  back  ground  of  his  mother  is  unclear,  he  was  profiled  in  a  biographical  vol  ume  of  the  Russian  Jewish  Encyclope  dia  that  was  published  in  1997.   Berel  Lazar,  one  of  Russia’s  two  chief  rabbis,  said  he  has  met  Fradkov  in  the  past.  “He  is  very  knowledge  able  about  economics.  He  hopefully  will  direct  his  cabinet  toward  resolv   ing  Russia’s  most  serious  problems  such  as  poverty,”  said  Rabbi  Lazar.   Russian  experts,  whom  the  choice  of  Fradkov,  53,  has  taken  by  surprise,  describe  him  as  a  civil  servant  who  is  likely  to  become  a  bureaucratic  prime  minister  devoted  to  Putin.   Whether  he  will  serve  in  his  post  for  very  long  is  unclear.  Russian  vot  ers  go  the  polls  on  March  14  in  an   election  that  is  believed  to  be  a  rub   ber  stamp  for  Putin,  and  a  new  cabi  net  has  to  be  approved  after  the   election.   But  most  experts  believe  Fradkov  will  remain  in  office  for  at  least  a  year.   Fradkov  has  been  a  foreign  trade  offi  cial  since  1972,  when  at  the  age  of  21  he  got  a  job  as  an  economic  adviser  with  the  Russian  Embassy  in  New   Delhi.   He  first  joined  the  Russian  Gov  ernment  in  1992,  shortly  after  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union,  when  he  was  deputy  foreign  trade  minister  in  the  reformist  government  headed  by  Yegor  Gaidar.   He  served  as  trade  minister  for  less  than  a  year  in  1997,  and  was  named  foreign  trade  minister  two  years  later.  He  lost  his  job  when  Putin  was  elected  president  in  2000.   Before  this  week’s  appointment,  Fradkov’s  high  point  came  in  March  2001  when  he  was  made  head  of  the   tax  police,  charged  with  ending  Rus  sia’s  massive  tax  evasion.  The  agency  was  disbanded  during  a  government  reshuffle  in  2003  and  Fradkov  was  sent  to  Brussels  to  represent  Russia  in  the  European  Commission.   For  some  Russian  Jewish  leaders,  Fradkov’s  Jewishness  is  welcome.  “This  nomination  sends  a  clear  signal  to  everyone,”  said  Yevgeny  Satanovsky,  president  of  the  Russian  Jewish  Congress.   “Can  a  Jew  become  Russian  prime  minister?  The  answer  is  yes.  The  next  question  can  only  be  whether  a  Jew  can  be  Russia’s  president.  But  this  nomination  basically  means  that  in  today’s  Russia  a  Jew  can  be  anything.  And  this  is  very  positive,”  Satanovsky   said.   “Of  course,  this  is  an  overall  posi  tive  thing  to  Jews,”  said  Lyudmila  Krasnopolskaya,  an  English-language  instructor  at  a  Moscow  college.  “Yet  I’m  not  sure  this  choice  will  necessar  ily  make  all  Russians  that  haDDV.”   JTA   Russian  prime  minister-designate  Mikhail  Fradkov  sits  in  front  of  Lenin's  bust   during  a  recent  parliamentary  meeting  in  Moscow.

"  MUSEUM  HONOURS  JEWISH  BOXERS   A  NEW  exhibit  at  the  National  Museum  of  American  Jewish  History  aims  to  draw  attention  to  a  little-known  episode  in  modem  Jewish  life:  when  Jews  dominated  the  ring  in  professional  boxing.  Entitled  Sting  Like  a  Maccabee:  The  Golden  Age  of  the  American  Jewish  Boxer,  the  exhibit  opened  last  week  at  the  Philadelphia  museum  in  Pennsylvania  and  catalogs  the  period  from  1910-40,  when  there  were  26  Jewish  world  boxing  champions.  The  display  includes  a  rare  collection  of  boxing  apparel,  posters  and  photographs,  along  with  training  equipment  title  belts,  films,  and  original  radio  broadcasts  of  bouts  involving  Jewish  champions.  Among  those  being  celebrated  by  the  exhibit  are  greats  such  as  Benny  Leonard,  who  held  the  lightweight  championship  title  for  eight  years  beginning  in  1917  and  lost  just  three  out  of  his  191  fights.  Others  include  Lew  Tender,  who  was  considered  one  of  the  best  left-handed  fighters  in  the  sport’s  history,  and  was  elected  to  the  Boxing  Hall  of  Fame  in  1961.

"  CNN  apologises  to  Lieberman  over  ‘Jewish  question’   WASHINGTON  -  A  CNN  anchor   man  apologised  to  Senator  Joseph  Lieberman  this  week  for  asking  him  to  answer  a  question  “as  a  Jew”.   “Senator,  as  a  Jew,  do  you  believe  the  construction  of  the  security  wall  in  Israel  is  the  right  path  to  peace?”  Bill  Hemmer  asked  Lieberman  last  Friday.

Lieberman  said  the  US  should   respect  Israel’s  right  to  defend  itself  against  terrorism  and  said  he  thinks  “the  wall  will  help”.  He  also  described  it  as  “temporary”,  and  said  the  US  has  “a  right  as  [Israel’s]  ally  to  talk  to  them  about  where  that  wall  goes”.   Referring  to  Hemmer’s  original  question,  Lieberman  added:  “But  I  want  to  repeat,  it’s  the  American  way  not  to  judge  candidates  by  their  faith,  but  by  their  policies.  That’s  the  way  we  do  it  in  this  country  and  that’s  the  way  I  know  the  American  people  will  judge  me.”   Senator  John  Kerry  of  Massachu  setts  was  the  surprise  victor  in  the  January  19  Iowa  caucus.  Even  if  he  does  poorly  in  this  week’s  New  Hampshire  vote,  Lieberman  hopes  to  salvage  his  bid  for  the  presidency  by  winning  some  of  the  February  3  pri   maries  where  he  has  invested   resources,  including  Delaware,  Ari  zona,  New  Mexico  and  Oklahoma.

"  Jewish-gypsy  dispute  resolved   RUTH  ELLEN  GRUBER   ROME  -  A  historic  Serbian  Jewish  cemetery  that  for  decades  has  been  home  to  hundreds  of  gypsies  is  get  ting  a  facelift  after  an  agreement  negotiated  by  the  head  of  the  tiny  Jewish  community  in  the  town  of  Nis.   The  cemetery,  which  has  been  at  the  centre  of  a  dispute  between  local  Jews  and  Roma  gypsies,  will  be  reno  vated  by  30  soldiers  from  the  Serbian  Army  in  coming  weeks.

Earlier  this  year,  tensions  between  Jews  and  gypsies  grew  heated  over  whether  the  gypsy  village  should  be  officially  sanctioned  by  the  munici   pality  or  whether  the  gypsies  ought  to  be  removed  from  the  cemetery  site.

"  Jews  who  hated  being  Jewish   BERELWEIN   THE  history  of  the  Jewish  people  is  replete  with  descriptions  of  Jews  who  hated  themselves  for  being  bom  Jew  ish  and  who  hated  Judaism,  other  Jews  and  in  many  instances,  all  of  humankind.   These  self-haters  were  traditionally  recognised  in  the  Jewish  world  as  trai  tors  and  as  a  danger  to  Jewish  survival.   In  the  Bible,  we  read  of  such  peo  ple  as  Ravshake,  the  Jewish,  Hebrew  speaking  spokesman  for  Sanheriv,  the  Assyrian  king  and  besieger  of  Jerusalem.   The  Greeks  found  many  willing  collaborators  among  the  Jews  in  their  attempt  to  eradicate  Judaism  and  install  their  more  “enlightened”  pagan  culture  in  Israel.   These  Hellenist  Jews  hated  their  brethren  and  openly  sided  with  the  enemies  of  Israel.  They  hated  them  selves  for  being  Jewish  and  even  resorted  to  painful  cosmetic  surgery  to  remove  any  trace  of  Jewish  appear   ance.   Pork  was  the  meat  of  choice  in  their   diet  Naturally,  the  victory  of  the  Mac  cabees  over  the  Greeks  was  a  great  dis  appointment  to  them.   The  Romans  also  found  Jews  will  ing  to  help  them  in  their  destruction  of  Jewish  sovereignty  and  the  Temple.   Traditional  Jews  viewed  such  Jews  as  people  who  had  been  stricken  with  a  malady  of  the  soul,  a  sickness  of  mind  and  spirit.   In  the  Middle  Ages,  Jewish  self  haters  converted  to  Christianity  and  volunteered  their  services  to  the  Church’s  attempts  to  convert  all  Jews.   Jewish  scholars  such  as  Rabbi  Moshe  ben  Nahman  (Nahmanides)  and  Rabbi  Yosef  Albo  were  forced  to  debate  Jewish  apostates,  whose  hatred  of  Jews  and  Judaism  was  even  more  fanatical  than  that  of  their  new  Chris  tian  coreligionists.   Followers  of  false  messiahs  in  the  Jewish  world  also  turned  into  self  haters  after  their  utopia  failed  to  be   realised.   The  Church  eventually  tired  of  using  Jews  to  destroy  Judaism  and  the  Jews  eventually  tired  (though  never  fully)  of  false  messianism  as  well.   But  the  greatest  damage  done  by  Jewish  self-haters  was  reserved  for  modem  times.  From  the  beginning  of  the  19th  century  until  today,  Jewish  self-haters  abound  and  are  given  great  publicity,  in  both  the  Jewish  and  non  Jewish  world.   The  Bolshevik,  Communist  Jews  were  the  greatest  antisemites,  hating  all  other  Jews  and  determined  to  exterminate  any  vestige  of  Judaism  or  the  “old  Jew.”  In  reality,  they  hated  themselves  and  could  not  forgive  themselves  or  their  ancestors  for  hav  ing  been  bom  Jewish.   Walter  Rathenau,  a  German  Jew  who  rose  to  be  the  foreign  minister  of  Germany  in  the  Weimar  Republic  and  who  was  later  assassinated  for   being  Jewish,  wrote  an  essay  called  “Hear  O  Israel,”  in  which  he  “con  firmed”  that  all  of  the  antisemitic  canards  against  Jews  were  true.   The  self-haters  still  exist  among  us  today.  There  are  political  parties  in  Israel  whose  sole  platform  is  hatred  of  other  Jews  and  of  Judaism’s  laws  and  traditions.   All  of  this  is  cloaked  as  “humanis  tic  values”  and  “individual  freedoms,”  but  the  end  result  is  hatred  of  Jews  and  Judaism.   Today,  many  of  these  self-haters  have  the  luxury  of  being  able  to  say  that  they  are  only  anti-Israel  or  anti   Zionist.   But  the  truth  is  these  “enlight  ened”  intellectuals  hate  themselves,  and  in  their  minds  have  created  justi  fications  to  hate  the  Jewish  people   and  the  Jewish  state  as  well.   The  19th-century  wags  in  Vienna  stated  that  antisemitism  was  going  nowhere  until  the  Jews  themselves  took  up  its  cause.  The  present-day  Europeans  who  so  piously  accuse  Jews  of  every  wrong  imaginable  state  that  they  are  only  repeating  what  visiting  Israeli  professors  and  much  of  the  Israeli  media  themselves  are  saying.   I  don’t  know  the  exact  cause  of  Jewish  self-hatred,  and  I  have  no  magic  pill  to  cure  it,  but  at  least  the  disease  should  be  recognised  for  the  pathology  it  is.

"  Jewish  fundamentalism   ASK  THE  RABBI   RABBI  RITCHIE  MOSS   Are  there  Jewish   fundamentalists  paralleling  those  in  Christianity  and   Islam?  If  so,  what  per  cent  of  Jews  would  or  could  be   classified  as  fundamentalist?  And  what  would  be  their  core  beliefs?   I’M  not  sure  what  your  definition   of  fundamentalist  is,  but  here’s  mine:  a  fundamentalist  is  some  one  who  believes  that  theirs  is  the   only  true  path  and  anyone  who  does  not  follow  their  ways  is  evil.  The  fundamentalist  sees  only  two  options  for  the  rest  of  humanity  -  join  us  or  suffer  the  consequences.   Other  nations  are  there  to  either   “colonise”  or  destroy  and  any  belief  system  that  does  not  conform  to   theirs  is  to  be  eradicated.   A  fundamentalist  is  not  the  same  as  an  extremist.  There  are  those   who  are  passionate  or  even  extreme  about  their  own  beliefs,  whether  a  born-again  Christian,  devout  Mus  lim,  radical  liberal,  or  die-hard  atheist.  We  can  debate  the  pros  and  cons  of  each  of  these  belief  systems,  but  a  strong  conviction  alone  doesn’t  make  you  a  fundamentalist.   It  is  when  you  cannot  accept  that  there  may  be  another  road  to  truth  or  that  not  everyone  has  to  fit  in  to  your  own  world  view  that  you  have  strayed  into  the  realm  of  funda   mentalism.   For  this  reason,  Judaism  can  never  tolerate  fundamentalism.   Quite  simply,  we  don’t  believe  that  Judaism  is  for  everyone.  Jewish  thought  is  comfortable  with  the  belief  that  there  are  many  paths  to  God.  Judaism  is  the  path  for  Jews,  and  non-Jews  can  find  God  in  dif  ferent  ways.  They  can  live  a  moral  and  good  life  without  keeping  the  laws  or  sharing  the  beliefs  of  Judaism.   Anyone  can  join  Judaism  by  con  verting,  but  this  is  not  necessary.  A  non-Jew  can  be  fulfilled,  dose  to  God,  and  earn  a  place  in  heaven  without  becoming  Jewish.  I  think  it  is  this  universal  approach  that  has  saved  Judaism  from  the  plague  of   fundamentalism.   There  are  certainly  Jewish  extremists,  ratbags,  troublemakers  and  wackos,  but  I  don’t  know  of  any  significant  group  of  Jewish  fundamentalists.  Judaism  poses  a  challenge  to  the  fundamentalist:  if  you  really  love  God  so  much,  shouldn’t  you  also  love  all  of  God’s   children?

"  Lowy  vs  Brogden:  only  the  Jew  is  a  ‘Judas’   VIEWPOINT   STEPHEN  ROTHMAN   Let  us  be  under  no   illusions:  the  attack  by  John  Brogden  on  Frank   Lowy,  and  the  manner  of  the  attack,  was   fundamentally  because   he  is  Jewish.   SHAVE  followed  with  growing  con   cern  the  statements  made  by  John  Brogden  about  Frank  Lowy  (AJN  3/12)  and  with  even  more  alarm  the  seeming  silence  of  the  community  (including  in  theAJN)  in  response.   As  Jews,  we  encourage  a  certain  level  of  conduct  on  members  of  the  community  because,  while  no-one  is  an  island,  we  know  only  too  well  that  conduct  by  any  one  of  us  leads  to  the  denigration  of  all  of  us.  The  quid  pro  quo  is  that  we  see  an  unjustified  attack  on  one  of  our  members,  because  of  her/his  Jewishness,  as  an   attack  on  us  all.   Let  us  be  under  no  illusions:  the  attack  on  Frank  Lowy,  and  the  man  ner  of  the  attack,  was  fundamentally  because  he  is  Jewish.   True,  you  may  say,  he  has  sufficient  resources  to  defend  himself.  But  is  he   less  entitled  to  our  support  than  a  member  of  our  community  who  has   no  resources?   Here  is  a  member  of  our  commu   nity  who  has  supported  and  contin  ues  to  support  our  community,  not  only  with  money  but  with  moral  sup  port,  and  from  whom  the  comm  unity  has  drawn  enormous  nachas.  Here  is  a  family  which  has  pursued  our  interests  and  funded  our  pro  grams  at  significant  cost  and  for  no   personal  benefit  And  how  do  we  repay  that?  By  treating  them  worse   than  others!   Of  course,  if  any  corruption  has  occurred  in  relation  to  the  Orange  Grove  affair,  then  it  should  be  investi  gated  and  the  leader  of  the  Opposi  tion  is  entided,  dare  I  say  required,  to  raise  issues  in  an  appropriate  manner  about  the  involvement  of  the  NSW  premier.   But  do  not  be  deluded.  There  are  many  allegations  of  corruption,  made  almost  daily,  throughout  Australia;  yet  only  when  a  Jew  is  allegedly  involved  is  there  a  reference  to  “Judas”.   For  those  unfamiliar  with  the  story,  Judas  was  the  disciple  who  sold  out  Jesus  for  30  pieces  of  silver.  The  analogy  itself  shows  that  the  only  link  between  Judas  and  Lowy  is  their  Jew  ishness.  Judas  is  the  “reviled  Jew”  whose  traitorous  disloyalty  led  to  the  death  of  Jesus.  What  other  analogy,  other  than  Jewishness,  applies?  There   is  none!   When  the  necessarily  pejorative   connotation  of  the  statement  on  the  community  was  drawn  to  Brogden’s  attention,  we  received  a  disingenuous  explanation  that  there  was  no  inten  tion  to  denigrate  the  Jewish  commu  nity  and,  somewhat  unbelievably,   because  it  was  a  reference  to  Bob  Carr.  The  anti-vilification  laws  in  this  country  are  drafted,  deliberately,  to  render  irrelevant  the  intention  of  the  vilifier  to  cause  offence.  A  statement  is   considered  vilification  when,  objec  tively  viewed,  it  is  insulting  and  the   statement  has  been  made  because  of   the  ethnicity  of  the  person  or  group   defamed.   Is  our  gratitude  to  the  Federal  Government  for  its  support  for  our  community  and  the  State  of  Israel  such  that  we  are  prepared  to  turn  a  blind  eye  to  a  blatant  insult  to  the  community  by  the  state  Opposition   leader?   Is  our  support  for  long-term  sup  porters  in  the  NSW  Shadow  Ministry  such  that  we  should  ignore  this  slight  by  their  leader?   And  do  we  think  it  is  just  coinci  dence  that  Brogden  supported  a  com  mittee  of  investigation  on  which  sat  One  Nation  MP  David  Oldfield  and  Greens  MP  Lee  Rhiannon?   If  the  slur  was  truly  unintended,  then  we  have  seen  in  the  Opposition  leader  someone  who  is  insensitive  to  the  issues  of  the  community  and  unable  to  express  himself  without  causing  offence.   It  is  appropriate  that  we  express  genuine  gratitude  for  the  phenome   nal  support  from  our  Federal  Gov  ernment  and  those  genuine  support  ers  within  the  State  Opposition.  But  let  us  not  bury  our  heads  in  the  sand.   I  have  had  occasion,  from  time  to  time,  to  complain  about  statements  from  some  members  of  the  AT  P  fed  eral  caucus  for  their  anti-Israel  com  ments.  With  the  exception  of  One  Nation,  we  have  never  before  had   leaders  of  a  political  party  issuing  statements  that  are,  at  face  value,  bla  tantly  vilifying  of  members  of  the  Jewish  community  and  resurrecting  the  spectre  of  the  betrayal  and  death  of  Jesus  as  exemplifying  the  actions  of  leaders  of  the  Australian  Jewish  community.   I  have  no  connection  with  Frank  Lowy  and  neither  he  nor  any  mem  bers  of  his  family  are  aware  of  this  let  ter.  But  someone  needs  to  say  something!   Whether  or  not  there  has  been  corruption,  the  statement  by  Brogden  must  be  recognised  for  what  it  is,  and  the  prejudiced  tendencies  which  underpin  it  must  be  dealt  with  now.  The  community  must  not  remain   silent   Stephen  Rothman  is  the  immediate  past   president  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies.  He  is  a  member  of  the  ALP. ",2004-12-10

"  WWI  Digger  Albert  Levy  was  one  of  more  than  2300  Jews  enlisted.   JEWISH  DIGGERS   DOWN  THE  DECADES   IN  World  War  I,  more  than  2300  Jew  ish  men  enlisted  as  Diggers  out  of  an  Australian  Jewish  population  of  less  than  18,000.  Twelve  per  cent  of  Jew  ish  Australians  enlisted,  three  per  cent  higher  than  the  national  aver  age.   A  total  of  176  Jewish  soldiers  held  commissioned  officer  rank,  the  most  famous  being  General  Sir  John  Monash.   In  World  War  II,  more  than  3800  Jewish  men  and  women  served  in  the  Australian  armed  forces,  significantly  higher  than  the  national  enlistment  rate.  During  both  world  wars,  the  ratio  of  Jewish  soldiers  that  paid  the  supreme  sacrifice  was  slightly  above  the  national  average.

"  Republicans  woo  Orthodox  Jewish  vote   MATTHEW  BERGER   NEW  YORK  -  There  is  a  standard  pitch  that  Republicans  make  to  a  Jewish  audience,  and  it  usually  centres  around  the  support  Israel  has  received  from  the  Bush  administration  and  the  Republican  controlled  Congress.   But  put  Republicans  in  front  of  a  group  of  Orthodox  Jews,  and  the  dis  cussion  becomes  more  intimate.   “You  represent  a  set  of  views  and  values  that  are  beautiful,  that  are  courageous  and  that  are  right  for  mankind,”  Senator  Sam  Brownback  told  Orthodox  leaders  at  a  Bush/Cheney  meeting  for  observant  Jews.  “We  want  you  as  part  of  this  party.”   While  the  Bush  administration  and  re-election  campaign  have  been  focused  on  getting  Jews,  seen  as  a  traditionally  Democratic  voting  bloc,  to  consider  supporting  President  Bush  this  November,  they  think  longer-term  when  they  talk  to  the  Orthodox  community.   Sensing  that  Orthodox  Jews  may  share  more  values  with  Christian  conservatives  than  with  less   observant  Jews,  Republican  strate  gists  think  they  can  get  more  Ortho  dox  voters  to  support  Republicans,  both  in  November  and  in  the  future.   That  would  mean  more  than  just   Anti-Bush   demonstrators  outside  the  US  Embassy  in  Tel   Aviv,  protesting  against  US   involvement  in   Iraq  and  Israel’s  settlement   policy,  among  other  issues.   Photo:  Isranet   votes:  Being  able  to  showcase  men  with  kippot  and  side-locks  would  help  bolster  the  Republicans’  argument  that  they  are  a  party  of  diversity.   The  conversation  touched  on  Israel,  and  Brownback  even  suggest  ed  that  now  that  Bush  has  changed  the  US  position  on  settlements,  he  should  take  the  issue  of  Jerusalem  off  the  table  by  declaring  that  it  belongs  only  to  Israel.   Talk  also  focused  on  preventing  the  legalisation  of  gay  marriage  and   preserving  the  preciousness  of  all  life,  including  the  unborn.  Those  subjects  are  strictly  taboo  in  meetings  with  non-Orthodox  Jews  because  most  Jewish  voters  disagree  with  the  Republicans  on  those  topics.   Two  other  Republican  senators,  Norm  Coleman  and  Rick  Santorum,  toured  an  Orthodox  social  service  institution  in  the  ultra-Orthodox  neighborhood  of  Boro  Park,  Brooklyn,  touting  their  support  for   faith-based  initiatives.   The  effort  to  reach  out  to  the   Orthodox  community  has  not  always  been  there.   Religious  Jews  traditionally  were   seen  as  more  concerned  about  local   politics,  and  as  aligned  with  the  Democratic  Party.   The  Democrats  also  seem  to  regard  the  Orthodox  community  as  a  voting  group.  Cameron  Kerry,  brother  of  Democratic  presidential  nominee  John  Kerry  and  his  surro  gate  in  the  Jewish  community,  met  with  Orthodox  leaders  in  New  York   last  week.

Photo:  ap/aap   Jewish  graves  desecrated  in  France   PARIS  -  One  hundred  and  twenty  seven  tombstones  were  desecrated  at  a  Jewish  cemetery  in  France  last  week.  An  additional  20  graves  were  desecrated  in  a  Catholic  cemetery  but  police  believe  the  two  acts  are   unrelated.   Meanwhile,  antisemitic  attacks  in  France  rose  sharply  during  the  first   quarter  of  2004.  Figures  released  last  Saturday  by  the  Interior  Ministry,  which  collates  statistics  in  co-opera  tion  with  Jewish  groups,  showed  there  were  67  acts  of  violence  against  Jewish  persons  or  property  since  the  beginning  of  the  year,  up  from  42  incidents  in  the  last  quarter   of  2003.   The  number  of  overall  incidents  against  Jews  however  fell  from  191  to  160  over  the  same  period.  The  rise  in  the  number  of  recorded  antisemitic  acts  could  stem  from  increased   police  activity  and  the  Jewish  com  munity’s  efforts  to  encourage  vic  tims  to  report  attacks,  the  Interior   Ministry  said.

"  Supporting  Jewish  youth,  Perth-style   DEBBY  VILENSKY   PASSIONATELY  Zionist  with  a  mix  of  social,  cultural  and  educational  events,  Perth's  four  main  youth  groups  cater  for  the  diverse  interests  of  the  younger  generation.   The  Australian  Union  of  Jewish  Students  (AUJS),  Bnei  Akiva,  Habonim  Dror  and  Young  United  Israel  Appeal  (YUIA)  each  have  a  strong  following  in  Perth,  celebrating  Jewish  culture,  histo-  ry  and  festivals  in  an  individual  way.   AUJS  in  WA  with  more  than  350  members  was  recently  nationally  recog-  nised  for  its  great  emphasis  placed  on  student  politics  and  support  for  Israel.   AUJS  WA  president  Paul  Levitt  said  the  state's  political  campaign  made  the  other  states  sit  up  and  take  notice.   ""Over  the  last  three  years,  AUJS  WA  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  AUJS'  national  political  campaign,  running  the  first  ever  Israel  Week  in  2003  and,  was  the  first  to  shift  the  emphasis  of  Jewish  Awareness  Weeks  on  campus  to  incorporate  petting  zoos  and  other  entertaining  demonstrations  represent-  ing  kibbutz  life  and  other  aspects  of   Israeli  culture,""  he  said.   Bnei  Akiva  is  a  modern  orthodox  youth  group  with  40-60  children   Paul  Levitt,  Danit  Maor  and  Greg  Weinstein  in   Purim  costume.   attending  weekly  meetings.    Bnei  Akiva  Perth  director  Osher  Gutnick  said  lead-  ers  provided  information  on  the  politi-   cal  issues  within  Israel.   ""As  a  general  rule,  politically,  Bnei  is  non-partisan,  that  is  we  look  at  each  situation  individually  and  take  a  stance  on  a  case-by-case  basis,""  he  said.   Habonim  Dror  follows  the  idea  that  going  on  aliyah  is  the  ultimate  expres-   sion  of  Judaism.   ""We  provide  more  informal  educa-   tion  for  youth  about  world  issues  affecting  Jewish  people,  the  history  of  the  Jews  and  Zionism,""    Habonim  Dror  WA  secretary  Mark  Lowenthal  said.   Weekly  meetings  along  with  camps  kept  the  'Habo  family'  tight  knit,   Lowenthal  said.   YUIA  is  a  branch  of  the  UIA  for  peo-  ple  aged  18-25,  which  exists  to  raise  money  for  Israel.   Social  event  co-ordinator  Ciara  Schneiderman  said  YUIA  incorporated  the  social  side  of  Jewish  life  with  edu-  cation.   YUlA's  Shabbat  dinners  catered  for  the  older  crowd  in  a  formal  but  fun  environment.   ""It's  about  creating  an  awareness  of  the  issues  Jews  around  the  world  and  in  Israel  face  with  a  hope  of  supporting  them  and  offering  assistance  wherever  possible,""  Schneiderman  said.   The  youth  groups  serve  an  impor-  tant  role  in  the  lives  of  young  Jews  in  the  community,  giving  them  a  voice,  an  avenue  to  confront  discrimination,  cel-  ebrate  their  religion  and  have  a  whole   lot  of  fun.   Perth  might  have  the  smaller  Jewish  population  but  there  is  no  shortage  of  cultural,  educational,  religious  and  social  stimulation. ",2004-06-11
"  Eriksson  coaches  Jewish   Arab  team   ENGLISH  soccer  coach  Sven  Goran  Eriksson  last  week  did  his  bit  for  Middle  East  relations,  coaching  a  Jewish-Palestinian  team  competing  in  the  Gothia  Youth  Cup  in  Sweden.   According  to  a  report  in  the  Jewish  Chronicle,  Eriksson,  a  native  of  Sweden,  devoted  part  of  his  hol  iday  to  working  with  the  squad  of  10-  and  11-year-olds  from  the  Peres  Centre  for  Peace.  Eight  are  Jews  from  Negev  development  towns,  eight  are  Palestinians  from  Jericho  and  Issawiya,  east  of  Jerusalem.   Eriksson  played  down  his  role,  suggesting:  “I  just  wished  them  good  luck.  The  team  already  has   two  coaches  and  I  do  not  want  to   take  the  job  away  from  a  col  league.”   The  boys’  final  record  was  two   victories  and  two  defeats.  Some  1525  teams  from  60  countries   competed  in  this  year’s  Gothia  Cup,  which  concluded  on  Satur  day.   Eriksson  stressed:  “I  am  just  a   football  fan.  I  never  make  state   ments  about  politics.  To  me  this  is  not  politics,  this  is  commonsense.   It  must  be  better  that  the  children   are  playing  football  than  throwing   bombs  at  each  other.”   The  Peace  Team  was  “a  good  example  of  people  trying  [to  co  exist  harmoniously]”.   Ericksson’s  involvement  with  the  Peace  Team  is  linked  to  Lon   don  charity  Truce  International,  led  by  his  partner,  Nancy  Dell’O  lio.  Truce  promotes  peace  through   football  and  Dell’Olio  has  visited  the  West  Bank  in  its  cause.   She  said  that  the  organisation  had  been  instrumental  in  getting  the  Peace  Team  invited,  Eriksson  helping  matters  along  through  his  friendship  with  Gothia  Cup  chief   Dennis  Andersson.   The  Jewish-Palestinian  team’s  manager  Shahar  Eidelman  said  “the  kids  were  overwhelmed  by  Mr  Eriksson’s  presence  during  the  first  game.  During  the  match,  one  of  the  players  ran  to  the  sidelines  to  have  his  picture  taken  with  him.   “He  gave  them  a  pep  talk  before  the  match  and  congratulated  them   after  it  had  finished.  He  is  a  won   derful  man  and  took  a  genuine  interest  in  the  program.”   Eidelman  also  applauded  the  “excellent  spirit”  between  the  young  Jews  and  Palestinians.   “If  someone  scores,  they  give  each  other  high  fives  and  if  some  one  gets  injured  they  all  gather  round  in  concern.

"  Jewish  candidates  out  in  force   AVIVA  BARD   THERE  may  not  be  a  “Jewish  vote”,  but  an  unprecedented  number  of  Jewish  candidates  are  standing  in  next  week’s  NSW  council  elections.   At  least  30  have  nominated  in  Randwick,  Waverley,  Woollahra,  Ku  ring-gai  and  Botany:  three  groups  of  three  Jewish  independents  are  contest  ing  Randwick’s  three  wards,  while  10  Jewish  candidates  are  standing  in  Waverley,  seven  in  Woollahra,  three  in  Ru-ring-gai  and  one  in  Botany.   Waverley  Councillor  George  New  house  takes  some  of  the  credit,  saying  his  establishment  of  the  Jewish  Labor  Forum  last  year  has  been  a  source  of  inspiration  for  a  number  of  young  Jews  “to  take  action  politically”.   “I  have  been  very  active  in  encour  aging  young  people  to  run,”  he  said.   “Until  recendy,  the  Jewish  commu  nity  has  distanced  itself  from  politics  -  that’s  a  dangerous  position  to  be  in.   “The  Iraq  war  and  the  way  Israel  is  portrayed  in  the  media  are  of  concern.  Local  government  is  not  where  the  Middle  East  is  debated,  but  it’s  the  first  port  of  call  for  young  politicians.   “The  best  way  to  be  effective  is   from  the  inside.”   Solicitor  and  fourth-generation   Councillor  George  Newhouse   Randwick  resident  Andrew  Hamil   ton,  32,  is  running  with  Yael  Basser  abie  and  Debbie  Javen,  while  the  other  Randwick  teams  comprise  Arthur  Hurwitz,  Shani  Gabai  and  Stan  Sacht,  and  Sharon  Parry,  Jenni  Cantori  and  Michael  Romm.   With  priorities  which  include  sus  tainable  development,  environmental  awareness  and  improved  services,  Hamilton  also  plans  to  promote  Jew  ish  affairs  and  combat  antisemitism.   “There’s  been  a  dramatic  increase  in  antisemitic  incidents,  with  people  attacked  in  the  streets  and  graffiti  on  the  University  of  NSW  campus,”  Hamilton  said.  “Council  has  to  create  an  environment  where  people  don’t  feel  able  to  do  these  things.”   The  prevalence  of  Jewish  candi   Candidate  Andrew  Hamilton   dates  stemmed  from  dissatisfaction  with  the  Greens,  who  were  behind  an  anti-Israel  policy  adopted  by  the  State  Greens  two  years  ago,  he  said.   “They  called  for  sanctions  against  Israel.  Many  people  voted  for  Greens  because  they  wanted  to  stop  over  development,  but  were  unaware  of  the  ideological  baggage.”   Long-time  candidate  Arthur  Hur   witz  left  the  Greens  in  2002  over  its   position  on  Israel.  “I  was  disillu  sioned.  It  was  a  shock  that  they  could  pass  such  a  vindictive  policy.  I’m  a  passionate  environmentalist,  but  they  had  a  much  broader  agenda.  I  want  to  keep  the  Greens  out  of  council.” ",2004-03-19
"  Jewish  roots   on  the  Murray   JACQUIGAL   MORE  than  35  Jewish  families  live  in  the  Albury-Wodonga  region  on  the  NSW-Victorian  border,  and  until  recently  many  believed  they  were  the  only  ones.   That  was  until  Rabbi  Yehudo  and  Rebbetzin  Leah-Miriam  Hei  dingsfeld  made  a  connection  with  Jews  in  the  area.  In  an  effort  to  enrich  Jewish  life  outside  of  Aus  tralia’s  urban  centres,  the  Mel  bourne  couple  -  who  are  affiliated  with  the  Chabad  movement  -   advertised  a  Jewish  support  group  in  local  publications  several  years  ago,  hoping  for  a  response.   As  Jewish  families  emerged,  the  Heidingsfelds  began  organis  ing  regular  Jewish  functions.  The  group  now  meets  approximately  six  times  a  year  -  including   Purim,  Succot  and  Chanukah.   “We  span  a  lot  of  areas,  helping  out  for  chagim,”  Leah-Miriam  Heidingsfeld  told  the  AJN.   “Unfortunately  we  have  been  involved  with  some  funerals  and   also  provide  counselling  -  what   ever  is  needed.”   The  next  function  is  the  annual   public  Chanukah  menorah-lighting  ceremony  in  Albury’s  QEII  Square,   on  Thursday,  December  9.

"  Remembering  Jewish  soldiers  on  ANZAC  Day   ORYANA  KAUFMAN   WITH  a  dog-tag  stating  name,  number  and  religion,  Jewish  soldiers  were  clearly  among  the  brave  commemorated  on  ANZAC  day.   The  annual  NSW  Association  of  Jewish  Ex  servicemen  and  Women  (NAJEX)  service,  held  in  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum,  commemorated  the  Jewish  soldiers,  sailors  and  airmen  who  gave  their  lives  in  World  Wars  I  and  II.   The  only  Jew  of  1200  soldiers  in  his  battal  ion,  Morris  Lewis,  79,  was  a  frontline  fighter  during  the  war  and  has  participated  in  ANZAC  marches  for  some  25  years.   ""It's  very  important  to  have  these  remem  brance  services,  it's  important  for  our  children  and  grandchildren  to  hear  what  happened,""   Lewis  told  the  AJN.   NAJEX  deputy  president  Jack  Stern,  79,  served  in  the  Royal  Australian  Air  Force  for  three  years  as  a  wireless  telegraphist  before  having  to  return  to  Australia  with  dengue  fever,  malaria  and  dermatitis  in  his  ears.   Stern,  who  was  based  in  Dutch  New  Guinea  and  Northern  Australia,  was  one  of  12  Jewish  telegraphists  serving  in  different  units.   ""It's  very  important  to  let  young  people  know  why  we  are  marching.  For  the  sake  of  peace,""  Stern  said.   Wreaths  were  laid  in  commemoration  by  major  communal  organisations,  schools  and  synagogues.  The  guest  speaker,  former  gover  nor  of  NSW,  Gordon  Samuels,  laid  the  first  wreath,  followed  by  NAJEX  president  Brian  Nebenzahl  and  the  oldest  member  of  NAJEX,  Major  General  Paul  Cullen.   Representatives  from  Mount  Sinai,  Moriah  and  Masada  Colleges  and  Emanuel  School   attended  the  service.   NAJEX  life  member  Hanry  Leslie.

"  in  three  overwhelmina  weeks   JACQUI  GAL   SINCE  it  began  five  years  ago,  Birthright  Israel  has  brought  60,000  youth  to  Israel  on  educational  pro  grams.  And  the  results  are  no  less  than  spectacular.   A  hall  filled  with  3000  voices  resounded  with  cries  of  ""Is-ra-el!  Is-ra  ell"",  on  the  closing  night  of  the  pro  gram  at  a  Birthright  mega  event  in  Jerusalem.  It  was  evidence  of  the  sup  port  and  the  warmth  that  these  par  ticipants  had  developed  for  the  country.   Hailing  from  Argentina,  Brazil,  Canada,  Colombia,  England,  the  Former  Soviet  Union,  France,  Germany,  Hungary,  Mexico,  Uruguay,  US  and  Australia,  the  groups  spend  10-17  days  seeing  as  much  of  Israel  as  is  humanly  possible  in  that  confined  time.   Rushing  through  museums,  dragged  away  from  tourist  sites,  par  ticipants  frequently  complained  at  the  lack  of  time  to  savour  the  experiences.   To  which  the  madrichim  countered:  ""It's  just  a  taste!  You'll  have  to  come  back.  Then  you  can  see  all  the  sites  and  stay  as  long  as  you  like.""   Many  participants  agreed.   ""I  always  had  a  love  for  Israel  because  of  school  and  the  youth  movements,""  commented  one,  ""but  I  didn't  know  why.  Now  I  understand  and  I  can't  get  enough  of  it.  Now  I'm  trying  to  get  back,  any  way  I  can.""   ""I  wasn't  brought  up  with  Zionism,  but  I  found  it  on  this  trip,""  said  anoth  er.  ""Being  here,  I  feel  a  connection  with  the  land,  the  people  and  the  meaning  behind  it.""   Asked  which  experience  affected  them  most,  many  cited  their  first  Friday  in  Israel  as  being  particularly  powerful.  They  spent  the  morning  vis  iting  Yad  Vashem,  returning  to  their  hotel  to  prepare  for  Shabbat  and  join  all  257  Australian  AUJS  program  par  ticipants  at  King  David's  Citadel  for  a   Kabbalat  Shabbat.   ""Spending  the  last  night  of   Chanukah  at  the  Kotel  was  the  most  fulfilling  experience  of  my  life,""  said  Sydneysider  Arsen  Ostrovsky,  23.  ""Singing,  praying  and  dancing  with  the  others  in  our  group  made  me  feel  so  alive,  so  Jewish!   ""I  remember  seeing  rabbis,  old  people  and  ultra-Orthodox  looking  at  us  and  smiling.  I  thought  'they  must  be  so  proud  of  us,  seeing  a  bunch  of  young  Jews  so  happy  and  passionate,  continuing  the  Jewish  and  Zionist  dream'.   ""It  epitomised  the  essence  of  Jewish  history  -  so  much  sadness,  suf  fering  and  violence,  yet  also  so  much  happiness,  joy  and  camaraderie.""   II  have  been  an  investor   for  most  of  my  life,  but   I  no  investment  has  been  |  more  worthy  My  dear  ;  young  friends,  it  has   been  worth  every  cent”   MICHAEL  STEJNHART   Birthright  Israel  co-founder   The  groups  participated  in  a  mif  gash  -  an  opportunity  to  meet  Israeli  youth  of  similar  age,  many  from  the  army.  The  Israelis  joined  their  Diaspora  counterparts,  travelling  on  their  buses,  sleeping  in  their  hotels,  exchanging  ideas  and  life  experiences.   The  Israelis  often  expressed  surprise  at  how  close-knit  the  Australian  Jewish  communities  are;  the  Australians  began  to  grasp  the  true  nature  of  a  sabra.   ""Before  I  got  here,  I  thought  all  Israelis  were  rude,""  commented  an  Australian;  ""I  don't  think  that  any  more.  They  are  so  warm  and  friendly.""   But  the  Australians  came  to  discov  er  more  than  love  of  the  country;  it  was  also  a  discovery  of  the  Jewish  world  within  them.   ""It  made  me  more  determined  to   AUJS  Birthright  Israel   participants  at  the  Israel  Museum  sculpture  park.   be  a  better  Jew  and  a  better  person,""  one  participant  explained.  ""Coming  here,  I  see  that  there  are  all  types  of   Jews.""   ""Now  I  know  there  are  nice  Jewish   girls  out  there,""  added  another.   By  interacting  with  peers  from  a  range  of  backgrounds,  participants  were  nudged  to  reflect  on  their  approaches  to  Judaism.  What  attitude  should  they  take  towards  Shabbat?  How  do  they  feel  about  intermar  riage?   For  many  it  was  a  chance  to  pause,  ponder  and  move  forward.  Some  began  wearing  a  kippa.   The  brainchild  of  North  Americans  Charles  Bronfman  and  Michael  Steinhart,  Birthright  Israel  was  launched  in  February  2000  after  the  pair  approached  the  Israeli  Government,  philanthropists  and  Diaspora  communities.  Their  proposal  was  to  enable  every  Jew  between  18  and  26  who  had  never  visited  Israel  on   a  program  to  do  so  and  enrich  their  Jewish  identity.   For  the  pilot  program,  Bronfman  and  Steinhart  put  forward  a  third  of  the  necessary  funds,  committing  $US8  million  each  to  the  project.  For  each  of  the  next  four  years  they  contributed  a  further  US$5  million.   Addressing  the  crowd  at  the  mega  event  in  Jerusalem,  Steinhart  said:  ""I  have  been  an  investor  for  most  of  my  life,  but  no  investment  has  been  more  worthy.  My  dear  young  friends,  it  has  been  worth  every  cent.   ""These  are  tough  times.  Israel  needs  its  friends.  In  this  room  there  are  3000.""   By  touring  Israel,  the  participants  had  collectively  contributed  $90  mil  lion  to  the  country's  economy,  he  said.  ""You  have  filled  its  hotel  rooms  -  but   more  importantly,  you  lift  the  spirits  of  the  Israelis  you  meet.""   The  benefits  extend  far  beyond  the  borders  of  Israel.  On  their  return  to  Australia,  participants  often  seek  greater  involvement  in  the  communi  ty,  says  AUJS  Israel  Programs  director   Sari  Goldman.   ""Whether  it's  through  attending  community  events  or  lighting  Shabbat  candles  every  week,  the  trips  have  strong  individual  effects.   ""One  of  the  most  important  tools  they  get  is  information  about  Israel,  so  they  can  combat  antisemitism.  They  are  inspired  to  learn  more,  get  the  facts  straight  and  see  that  the  media  doesn't  always  get  it  right.   ""It  also  establishes  a  connection  to  Israel  and  the  Jewish  people  world   wide.""   More  than  that,  Birthright  Israel  worldwide  has  seen  couples,  mar  riages  and  even  a  ""new  generation  of   Jewish  babies""  eventuate.   But  as  the  Israeli  Government  has  announced  its  financial  withdrawal  from  the  program,  the  future  of  Birthright  Israel  is  less  than  certain.   The  financial  burden  now  falls  to   philanthropists  and  individual  Diaspora  communities  to  ensure  the  survival  of  what  is  an  overwhelmingly  successful  project. ",2004-02-06
"  Jewish  News   On  poverty,  and  charity   BRW’s  annual  Rich  200  list  is  greeted  with  ambivalence  by  many   Jews.  For  some  it  is  a  source  of  pride;  for  others  unease.  Pride  because  many  of  the  Jews  on  the  list  are  true  rags-to-riches  tales.  People  such  as  Westfield  chief  Frank  Lowy,  who  arrived  here  as  a  refugee  from  the  war  in  1952  with  hardly  a  cent  to  his  name  and  barely  able  to  speak  English,  or  cardboard  king  Richard  Pratt,  whose  father  opened  a  small  business  in  Fitzroy,  Melbourne,  in  1948  which  Pratt  has  now  built  into  a  multi-billion-dollar  international  recycling  and  packaging  company.   And  unease  because  the  incommensurate  number  of  Jews  -  especially  in  the  top  10  -  may  be  manipulated  by  some  to  fuel  anti-Jewish  stereotypes.   While  the  BRW  list  grabs  the  media  headlines  on  an  annual  basis,  those  who  exist  on  the  margins  of  society  remain  in  the  shadows  precisely  because  they  are  at  the  opposite  pole  of  the  economic  spectrum.   It  is  these  people  who  have  been  spotlighted  this  week  through  Anti  Poverty  Week,  an  Australian  initiative  that  aims  to  promote  the  plight  of  this  country’s  poor  to  the  top  of  the  national  agenda.   While  there  is  no  disputing  the  relative  affluence  of  the  Australian  Jewish  community  as  a  whole,  living  in  our  midst  are  many  who  exist  close  to  or  below  the  poverty  line.   According  to  a  survey  just  released  by  the  Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victoria,  4.4  per  cent  of  Jewish  households  exist  on  a  gross  weekly  income  of  just  under  $200.  The  survey  also  revealed  that  39  per  cent  of  single-par  ent  families  with  dependent  children  earn  less  than  $600  per  week.   In  NSW  too,  a  demographic  survey  issued  in  2003  by  the  Jewish  Com  munal  Appeal  revealed  that  Jewish  families  in  Sydney  are  also  caught  in  the  poverty  trap,  especially  new  immigrants  from  the  former  Soviet  Union.  But  the  largest  group  in  financial  strife  is  the  elderly,  with  an  estimated  4230  people  existing  on  an  income  below  $400  per  week.   In  the  wider  Australian  community,  poverty  is  an  affliction  that  has  become  increasingly  entrenched  over  the  years.  A  Senate  report  on  poverty  released  earlier  this  year  found  that  about  2.5  million  Australians  -  includ  ing  750,000  children  —  live  below  the  poverty  line.   Titled  “A  hand  up  not  a  hand  out:  Renewing  the  fight  against  poverty”,  the  report  blasts  the  Federal  Government’s  seeming  indifference  to  those  who  live  on  the  margins  and  calls  for  a  national  strategy  to  fight  poverty  -   an  initiative  which  has,  to  date,  fallen  on  deaf  ears.   BUT  the  full  story  of  the  Jews  on  the  BRW  Rich  200  list  is  not  simply   whether  their  accrued  annual  wealth  has  risen  or  dipped.  What  the  headlines  often  fail  to  acknowledge  is  that  most  of  the  Jews  on  the  list  are  among  the  greatest  philanthropists  in  the  country.  Moreover,  they  don’t  just  donate  to  Jewish  causes.   Witness  the  Besen  family’s  $25-miliion  TarraWarra  Museum  of  Art  in  the  Yarra  Valley,  Australia’s  first  privately-owned  art  gallery.  Witness  too  Frank  Lowy’s  $50-million  Institute  for  International  Policy,  his  “gift”  to  Aus  tralia  on  the  50th  anniversary  of  his  arrival  in  this  country.   Charity,  according  to  Judaism,  is  not  just  a  commandment,  but  an  ingrained  norm  that  is  expected  of  an  individual  as  part  of  a  community,  dating  back  to  the  temple  when  Jews  donated  a  tithe  of  their  harvest  to  the  poor.  The  Hebrew  for  charity,  tzedakah,  comes  from  tzedek,  meaning  justice.  As  such,  giving  charity  is  not  just  considered  an  act  of  altruism,  but  an  act  of  justice  to  help  redistribute  resources  to  achieve  an  economic  equilibrium.   The  Australian  Jewish  community  has  a  long  history  of  donating  to  char  ity,  both  here  and  in  Israel.  And  while  we  take  great  pride  in  raising  funds  for  organisations  -  currently,  for  example,  Sydney’s  Masada  College  is  aim  ing  to  raise  $3.65  million,  and  Melbourne’s  Jewish  Holocaust  Museum  Foundation  has  set  a  target  of  $7  million  -  we  should  not  forget  the  indi  viduals  among  us  who  have  fallen  on  hard  times  or  who  have  arrived  as  new  immigrants  or  whose  poverty  is  defined  by  their  social,  not  economic,  isolation.  They  too  merit  our  help,  our  support,  our  charity.   The  burden  of  care  for  those  people  falls  largely,  but  not  exclusively,  on  the  shoulders  of  the  welfare  and  aged-care  organisations  in  this  community,  and  it  behoves  us  during  this  Anti-Poverty  Week  to  redouble  our  efforts  to  help  those  organisations  help  Jews  who  exist  on  or  below  the  poverty  line.   According  to  Maimonides,  who  identified  eight  levels  of  tzedakah,  the  greatest  form  of  charity  is  to  help  another  Jew  so  that  s/he  no  longer  needs  to  beg.  It  is  an  ideal  worth  striving  for. ",2004-10-22
"  Fine  selection  at  Jewish  film  festival   The  annual  Festival  of  Jewish  Cinema  opens  next  week  in  Sydney  with  18  films  over  18   days  being  screened  at  the  GU  Bondi  Junction  cinemas.  Film  critic  JAN  EPSTEIN  previews  her  selection  of  five  of  the  best  films  in  the  festival.   LOST  EMBRACE   OR   THE  GREAT  ROLE   AMEN   ARGENTINIAN  cinema  is  flourish  ing,  and  there  is  no  greater  evidence  of  this  than  Daniel  Burman’s  Lost  Embrace,  a  well-scripted,  naturalistic  &amp;lt;  '■  drama  which  is  a  worthy  successor  to   the  young  director’s  much  acclaimed  Waiting  for  the  Messiah.   The  audience  is  introduced  to   Burman’s  characters  through  the  eyes  of  Ariel  (Daniel  Hendler),  an  intense,  brooding  young  man  whose  divorced  mother  Sonya  (Adriana  Aizenberg)  owns  the  mall’s  lingerie  shop,  still  named  Elias’  Lingerie  for  the  father   that  Ariel  has  never  known.   Personalities  abound  in  the  mall,  among  them  the  Levin  brothers  who  k  ’  deal  in  fabrics,  a  Korean  couple  who   run  the  Feng  Shui  stall,  an  Italian  radio  repairman  whose  wife  runs  the  beauty  salon  next  door,  Ariel’s  older  brother  Joseph  who  wanted  to  become  a  rabbi  but  now  imports  nov  elties,  his  best  friend  Mitelman,  and  Rita,  who  absconds  from  her  internet  caf£  to  dally  with  Ariel  in  the  lingerie  shop  cubicles.   But  what  ails  Ariel,  and  prompts  him  to  apply  for  Polish  nationality  despite  his  grandmother  (Yiddish  actor  Rosita  Londner)  being  a  Polish  Holo  '  ’  caust  survivor,  is  revealed  gradually.   Burman’s  canvas  is  small  and   seemingly  banal,  yet  through  vivid  characterisations  and  a  sympathetic  understanding,  Burman  succeeds  in  making  Lost  Embrace  both  memo  rable  and  touching.   Lost  Embrace  screens  on  November  11,13  and  18.   ISRAELI  cinema  has  come  of  age  in  the  past  few  years,  with  a  spate  of  films  by  young  film-makers  depicting   Israel  as  a  secular  state.   Some  of  these  films  show  Israel  suf   fering  similar  problems  to  other  nations  participating  in  the  global  economy.   But  few  have  been  so  austerely  honest  as  Keren  Yedaya’s  Or  (My  Trea  sure),  which  deservedly  won  awards  this  year  at  both  the  Cannes  and  Jerusalem  film  festivals.   Seventeen-year-old  Or  (Dana  Ivgy)  is  a  student  at  the  local  high  school.  At  night  she  works  in  a  neigh  bour’s  restaurant,  and  by  day  she  col  lects  empty  cans  and  bottles  in  an  attempt  to  prevent  her  prostitute  mother,  Ruthie  (Ronit  Elkabetz),  from  going  back  onto  the  streets.   When  Ruthie  comes  out  of  hospi  tal,  weakened  by  years  of  whoring,  Or  makes  her  mother  promise  that  she  will  stick  with  the  cleaning  job  she  has   found  for  her  and  not  succumb  to  her  old  ways.   In  the  meantime,  Or  has  fallen  in  love  with  her  school  friend  Ido   (Meshar  Cohen).  But  when  a  past  boyfriend  on  leave  from  the  army  calls  on  her,  things  fall  apart.   Or  shocks  because  Yedaya  tells  her  bleak  story  with  such  power  and  skill.  The  director  is  a  political  activist  and  feminist,  but  her  anger  at  a  political  culture  that  betrays  women  and  allows  the  weak  to  fall  through  cracks  in  the  system  is  largely  mitigated  by  examples  of  its  sublime  opposite.   Or  screens  on  November  17  and  21.   FRENCH  cinema  is  notable  for  the   light  and  easy  way  Jewish  themes  are  woven  into  essentially  Gallic  stories,   and  Steve  Suissa’s  Le  Grand  Role  is  no  exception.   What  makes  this  film  so  reward   ing,  however,  is  the  use  Suissa  makes  of  The  Merchant  of  Venice,  which  for  Jews  is  Shakespeare’s  most  problem  atical  play.   Le  Grand  Role  begins  with  a  short,   clever  introduction  to  French  anti   semitism  and  apart  from  a  gratingly  loud  song  (a  la  A  Man  and  a  Woman)  that  announces  we  are  about  to  watch   a  love  story,  launches  immediately  into  the  film’s  appealing  saga.   Five  male  friends,  all  Jewish  and  determined  to  become  actors,  are  excited  by  the  news  that  a  famous  Jewish  Hollywood  director,  Rudolph  Grishenberg  (played  by  cult  actor  Peter  Coyote)  has  come  to  Paris  to  cast  actors  for  a  Yiddish  film  version   of  The  Merchant  of  Venice.   Front  runner  for  the  role  of  Shy  lock  is  Maurice  Katz  (Stephane  Freiss),  a  serious  man  in  his  mid-thir  ties  who  is  married  and  deeply  in  love  with  his  non-Jewish  wife  Perla  (Berenice  Bejo).  Maurice  is  offered  the  part,  but  when  Perla  begins  to  recoil  from  him,  the  aspiring  actor   becomes  frantic  to  find  out  the  cause.   If  an  impressive  Freiss  uttering  Shylock’s  famous  words  “I  am  a  Jew  ...”  in  Yiddish  doesn’t  bring  a  tear  to  the  eye,  then  nothing  will.   Le  Grand  Role  screens  on   November  23  and  27.   Directed  in  2002  by  Greek-born  film  maker  Constantin  Costa-Gavras,  whose  credits  include  Z,  Missing  and  The  Music  Box,  Amen  is  a  deeply  unset  tling  drama  about  the  Holocaust.   It  examines  the  main  historical   controversies  surrounding  this  terri  ble  event  as  objectively  as  possible.   Costa-Gavras  and  co-writer  Jean  Claude  Grumberg  (The  Sandwich  Years)  have  based  Amen  on  Rolf  Hochhuth’s  1963  play  The  Representa  tive  which  created  controversy  by  exposing  the  complicit  silence  of  Pope   Pius  XII  and  the  Catholic  Church  in   the  genocide  of  European  Jewry.   This  issue  is  still  central  to  the  film.   However,  by  building  his  drama  around  a  true  character,  the  con  science-stricken  Nazi  officer  Kurt  Gerstein  (Ulrich  Tukur),  who  over  saw  the  production  of  Zyklon  B,  and  a  fictional  composite  character,  Father  Riccardo  (Mathieu  Kassovitz),  a  young  Jesuit  who  is  secretary  to  the  Papal  nuncio,  Costa-Gavras  broadens  the  controversy.   He  tackles  the  issue  of  how  much  was  known  at  the  time  about  what   was  happening,  and  by  whom.   Most  importantly  the  film  asks  whether  anything  could  have  been  done  to  stop  the  slaughter.   Amen  is  made  with  great  intelli  gence  and  skill,  and  opens  up  the  deepest  questions  of  moral  ambiva  lence  confronting  the  perpetrators  and  observers  once  the  Shoah  gath   ered  momentum.

"  The  desecrated  solitary  Jewish  headstone  which  stands  in  the  cemetery  of  the  tiny  town  of  Wanganui,  200  kilometres  north  of  the  country’s  capital,  Wellington.   Photo:  Mike  Regan   More  Jewish  graves   desecrated  in  NZ   HENRY  BENIAMIN   TWO  more  Jewish  cemeteries  have  been  desecrated  in  New  Zealand.   Red  swastikas  were  discovered  last  week  painted  on  the  solitary  Jewish  headstone  honouring  14  Jews  which  stands  in  the  cemetery  of  the  tiny  town  of  Wanganui,  200  kilometres  north  of  the  country’s  capital,  Wellington.   The  stone  itself  had  also  been  smashed.  Only  a  handful  of  Jews  live  in  Wanganui  today.  The  memorial  pays  tribute  to  those  Jews  who  lived  there  as  early  settlers  when  it  was  a  bustling  community.   New  Zealand  Jewish  Council  presi  dent  David  Zwartz  told  the  AJN:  “We  have  no  idea  when  the  desecration  took  place.  There  is  little  we  can  do  until  the  damage  is  repaired  ...  at  that  time,  we  will  hold  a  rededication  service.”   The  Wanganui  District  Council  has   assumed  responsibility  for  the  repairs.   Meanwhile,  the  Symonds  Street  Cemetery  in  New  Zealand’s  largest  city,  Auckland,  has  been  the  scene  of  yet  more  desecration.  The  tiny  Jewish  cemetery  has  not  seen  a  burial  since  1923,  but  four  of  its  120  headstones  were  toppled  over.  A  board  member  of  the  city’s  Chevra  Kadisha  said:  “We  do  not  believe  this  is  the  work  of  anti  semites.  There  was  no  daubing  and  no  other  damage.  We  would  like  to  believe  this  is  no  more  than  wanton  vandalism.”   Five  weeks  ago,  113  headstones  were  overturned  in  Wellington’s  Makara  Cemetery.  Two  weeks  earlier,  Wellington’s  Bolton  St  Cemetery  was   also  desecrated.  The  Bolton  St  attack   occurred  during  the  night  following  the  jailing  of  two  Israelis  who  had  been  sentenced  for  fraudulently  attempting  to  obtain  a  New  Zealand  passport.

"  Stark  choice  for  Jewish  voters   THE  pending  election  presents  a  stark  choice  for  many  Jewish  voters  —   John  Howard’s  foreign  policies  versus  Mark  Latham’s  domestic  policies.   On  one  hand,  the  government’s  unstinting  support  for  Israel  is  peerless,  eclipsing  Labor’s  somewhat  equivocal  stance  on  certain  issues  regarding  the   Israeli-Palestinian  conflict.   Most  Australian  Jews  feel  a  deep  sense  of  gratitude  to  Prime  Minister  Howard  for  his  support  of  Israel,  especially  his  decision  to  join  the  war  on  Saddam  Hussein  and  more  recently  when  Australia’s  became  one  of  only  five  nations  to  support  Israel  at  the  UN  over  the  security  barrier.   Indeed,  the  Iraq  war  deposed  the  tyrant  who  had  bankrolled  the  families  of  Palestinian  suicide  bombers  to  the  tune  of  $US25,000  each.  As  such,  the  SAS’  role  in  neutralising  his  Scuds  resonated  with  Australian  Jews.   Many  Jews  endorse  the  government’s  stance  on  the  war  on  terror,  acutely  aware  of  the  threat  with  which  Israelis  contend.  Howard’s  foreign  policy  is  closely  tied  up  with  the  US  —  a  coalition  most  Australian  Jews  support.   Labor’s  equivocation  on  some  Middle  East  issues  would  propel  most  Jews  to  support  the  Coalition  on  this  issue.  That  said,  Mark  Latham  is  not  Simon  Crean  —  but  neither  is  he  Bob  Hawke.  Indeed,  a  question-mark  for  Jewish  voters  is  the  fact  that  he  has  been  largely  reticent  on  the  Middle  East.   To  his  credit,  he  has  drafted  Kim  Beazley,  a  vocal  Israel  supporter,  to  Defence,  which  will  go  some  way  towards  assuaging  Jews  who  are  concerned  with  Labor’s  position  on  Israel.  In  addition,  he  appears  to  have  quelled  the  anti  Israel  criticisms  which  emanated  from  the  Labor  backbench  under  Crean.   N  the  other  hand,  the  government’s  performance  in  three  key  areas  —  refugees,  reconciliation  and  a  republic  -  has  been  suspect  at  best,   woeful  at  worst.   Its  hardline  stance  on  refugees  and  asylum-seekers,  specifically  its  policy  of  mandatory  detention,  is,  to  borrow  from  Rabbi  Chaim  Gutnick,  reminis  cent  of  the  White  Australia  policy.  The  government  rightly  argues  that  it  has  stopped  the  boatloads  trying  to  reach  our  shores,  but  Australia  has  earned  a  reputation  as  a  fortress  state  which  imprisons  child  asylum-seekers.   Howard  refuses  to  apologise  to  indigenous  Australians,  standing  by  the  argument  that  the  injustices  of  the  past  were  not  carried  out  by  this  govern  ment.  This  virtual  impasse  has  done  little  to  address  Australia’s  most  long  standing  social  issue  and  remains  a  stain  on  our  society.   Finally,  the  resistance  to  the  notion  of  a  republic  is  anachronistic  for  a  country  which  has  come  of  age.  Most  Australians  appear  willing  to  shake  off  the  shackles  of  Westminster,  and  in  everything  but  name  this  nation  stands  on  its  own  as  an  independent  country  and  a  multicultural  success  story.   It  is  in  these  three  areas  that  Labor  offers  a  more  humane  and  progressive  option  at  the  ballot  box.  Thus,  in  its  starkest  form,  the  election  throws  up  the  following  conundrum  for  many  Jewish  voters:  the  Coalition’s  foreign  policies,  specifically  on  Israel,  as  against  Labor’s  policies  on  refugees,  recon  ciliation  and  a  republic,  which  suggest  a  more  caring  Australia.   Clearly,  there  are  other  issues  -  interest  rates,  education  and  health  -  which  are  also  battlegrounds.  And  there  are  local  issues  -  Wentworth,  where  Labor’s  David  Patch  has  a  chance  of  wresting  the  seat  from  the  Liberals  because  of  Peter  King’s  unpredictable  presence;  and  Melbourne  Ports,  where  Labor  incumbent  Michael  Danby  faces  Liberal  challenger  David  Southwick  -  the  first  time  Jews  from  the  major  parties  are  contesting  an  electorate.   All  things  considered,  it  appears  to  be  the  competing  claims  of  Labor’s  domestic  policies  and  the  Liberals’  foreign  policies  which  will  weigh  most  heavily  on  Jewish  voters  on  October  9.

"  Argentinean  president  caught  in  Jewish  spat   FLORENCIA  ARBISER   BUENOS  AIRES  -  A  communal   squabble  over  the  investigation  of  the  1994  bombing  of  the  AMIA  Jewish  community  centre  here  has  broken  out  in  full  view  of  Argentina’s  president.   Argentinean  President  Nestor  Kirchner  decided  to  go  to  Washington  to  accept  an  honour  last  week  from  the  American  Jewish  Committee  (AJC)  for  his  commitment  to  the  investigation  of  the  AMIA  bombing  and  his  public  inquiry  into  Argentina’s  history  of  har  bouring  Nazis  after  World  War  II.   But  Argentina’s  main  Jewish  polit  ical  umbrella  group  sent  Kirchner  a  very  different  message.   Speaking  at  the  AJC  annual  din  ner,  Kirchner  gave  his  country’s  “most  firm  commitment  to  ascertain  the  truth  of  these  events,  and  we  will  not   give  up  until  we  achieve  truth  in  both  die  embassy  and  the  AMIA  case”.   But  in  a  news  release  dated  May  5,  the  umbrella  organisation  of  Argen  tinean  Jews,  DAIA,  expressed  its  “deep  concern  for  the  stagnation  that  the  investigation  of  the  July  18,  1994,   attack  suffers  from”.   Eighty-five  people  died  when  a  bomb  ripped  through  the  AMIA  cen   tre  in  Buenos  Aires.   The  DAIA  said  it  was  “aggravated  by  recent  political  decisions  and  devi  ations  produced  by  the  oral  court”  investigating  the  involvement  of  local  Argentinians  in  the  attack,  which  many  community  members  believe  was  sponsored  by  the  government  of  Iran.  Jewish  officials  repeatedly  have  maintained  that  the  investigation  is  seriously  flawed.   “DAIA  considers  that  it  is  not  time  for  honours  and  that  the  cause   requires  a  real  political  will  for  finding  the  truth,”  the  statement  concluded.   “It  is  not  time  for   [receiving]  honours...  the  cause  requires  a  real  political  will  for  finding  the  truth”   DAIA  STATEMENT   The  statement  was  seen  as  a  polit  ical  broadside  at  the  president,  whose  government  has  taken  pains  to  push  the  AMIA  investigation  forward.   Argentina’s  largest  newspaper,  Clarin,  put  the  internal  Jewish  con  troversy  on  its  front  page.  In  the  story,  AMIA’s  current  president,  Abraham  Kaul,  defended  Kirchner.   Argentinean  President  Nestor  Kirchner  addresses  a  memorial  service  in  Buenos  Aires  last  year  marking  the  ninth  anniversary  of  the  bombing  of  the  AMIA  Jewish  community  centre.  Photo:  JTA   “Kirchner  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  state  of  the  investigation,”  Kaul  was  quoted  as  saying.  “The  president  has  done  all  he  could  for  the  investigation,  even  though  some  do  not  like  this.”   The  Argentinean  Foreign  Ministry  tried  to  keep  matters  calm.  This  is  an  “internal  Argentinean  issue”,  said  For  eign  Minister  Rafael  Bielsa.   Last  December,  the  judge  presid  ing  over  the  AMLA.  investigation  was  dismissed  for  allegedly  bribing  a  wit   ness  in  the  case.   Several  former  police  officers  are  accused  of  carrying  out  the  bombing.   Local  Jews  charge  that  the  court  is  investigating  the  investigation  rather  than  focusing  on  the  actual  defen   dants  and  those  behind  the  planning  of  the  bombing.   The  long-running  trial  of  the  for  mer  police  officers  is  scheduled  to  wrap  up  in  the  next  few  weeks.   Argentina’s  president  said  his  country  was  committed  to  finding  those  responsible  for  anti-Jewish  ter   rorist  attacks  in  the  1990s.   JTA ",2004-05-14
"  Jewish  leader  killed  in  Moscow  shooting   LEV  KRICHEVSKY   MOSCOW  -  The  motive  behind  the   killing  of  a  prominent  Jewish  leader   from  the  Caucasus  Mountains  is  unknown.   Zaur  Gilalov,  a  successful  business  man  and  the  head  of  the  World  Con   gress  of  Mountain  Jews,  was  shot  to  death  here  last  Friday.   He  was  killed  in  broad  daylight  by  two  unidentified  gunmen  not  far  from   his  office.   Gilalov  was  to  be  married  next  month  and  he  was  killed  while  leaving  a  tailor  shop  where  he  was  ordering  his  wedding  attire.   Jewish  leaders  and  GilaloVs  friends  say  antisemitism  was  not  the  motive  of   the  crime.  “I  don’t  believe  this  had  any  thing  to  do  with  his  religion,”  said  Pin  chas  Goldschmidt,  Moscow’s  chief  rabbi  and  a  friend  of  the  slain  Jewish  leader.  “We  don’t  have  a  clue  as  to  the  motives  of  this  crime.”   Dmitriy  Zagranichniy,  the  manag  ing  director  of  the  World  Congress  of  Mountain  Jews  agreed,  saying:  “No  one  knows  why  or  who.  He  hardly  had  any  enemies  at  all.”   Many  believe  that  Gilalov,  29,  was  a  victim  of  a  contract  murder  related  to  his  business  operations.   But  a  police  official  in  charge  of  the  investigation  told  a  news  agency  that  Gilalov  could  have  been  killed  by  members  of  a  rival  dan,  who  may  have  dedared  a  vendetta  on  Gilalov’s  family.   Seven  years  ago,  Gilalov’s  father  was  shot  to  death  in  Moscow;  that  case  remains  unsolved.   Gilalov  and  his  younger  brother,  Akif,  were  founders  of  the  Zar  Group,  a  company  that  develops  retail  malls  in  the  Russian  capital.   Jewish  leaders,  members  of  the  business  community  and  ordinary  Jews  were  among  the  hundreds  who  attended  Sundays  funeral  for  Gilalov  at  the  Jewish  section  of  Moscow’s  Vostryakovskoe  Cemetery.   Most  were  members  of  the  “Moun  tain  Jewish”  community,  which  origi  nated  in  the  eastern  Caucasus.  Like   many  members  of  this  group,  Gilalov  was  a  native  of  Azerbaijan,  and  many  of  the  mourners  at  the  funeral  flew  in   Zaur  Gilalov  (left)  meets  Rabbi  Yona   Metzger  in  Israel  last  year.

"  Kerry  reaches  out  to  Jewish  voters   RON  KAMPEAS   WASHINGTON  -  Now  that  John  Kerry  has  proven  that  he’s  electable,  he  is  ready  to  tell  Americans  why  he   should  be  elected.   Only  in  recent  days  has  the  Massa  chusetts  senator  started  to  outline  detailed  policy  positions.  Some  of  these,  which  deal  with  foreign  policy  and  terrorism,  have  been  of  particular  interest  to  Jewish  voters.   One  measure  of  his  new  serious  ness  was  a  New  York  meeting  on  Sun   day  with  about  40  Jewish  communal   leaders,  where  Kerry  spoke  at  great  length  on  his  Middle  East  policies.   “It  would  be  impossible  for  any  one  to  leave  that  meeting  not  impressed,”  said  Hannah  Rosenthal,  the  executive  director  of  the  Jewish  Council  for  Public  Affairs.   Until  now,  Kerry  has  had  litde  breathing  room  for  such  explanatory  encounters  because  of  the  gruelling  primary  schedule.   Cameron  Kerry,  the  candidate’s  brother  and  one  of  his  closest  advisers,  said:  “It’s  been  a  whirlwind  five  weeks   in  which  we’ve  been  trying  to  stay  a  half-step  ahead  of  the  next  stage.”   Kerry  has  hired  a  Jewish  co-ordi  nator  for  New  York,  Lisa  Gertsman.  But  Cameron,  who  converted  to  Judaism  20  years  ago  when  he  mar  ried  a  Jewish  woman,  is  the  key  to  the  '  campaign’s  Jewish  outreach  effort.   Participants  at  the  New  York  meet  ing  said  they  were  surprised  by  how  long  Kerry  had  taken  to  reach  out  to  Jews.  But  they  accepted  his  explana  tion,  noting  that  recent  changes  to  the  primary  schedule  —  front-loading   contests  to  the  first  three  months  of   the  year  -  had  created  a  “crushing”  campaign.   “It  was  the  first  time  we’ve  had  to  test  these  issues  and  it  was  an  impor  tant  exchange,”  said  Malcolm  Hoen  lein,  the  executive  vice-chairman  of  the  Conference  of  Presidents  of  Major  American  Jewish  Organisations.   A  come-ffom-behind  victory  on  January  19  in  Iowa  propelled  Kerry  -  who  as  late  as  November  was  subject  to  “when  will  he  drop  out”  specula   ;tjon  —  to  18  of  20  victories.

"  Jewish  News   The  post-Arafat  era   IT  is  the  fate  of  the  Israelis  and  Palestinians,  to  an  extent  unmatched  by   any  other  warring  peoples,  that  they  have  to  act  out  the  drama  of  their  conflict  on  a  world  stage.  There  are,  of  course,  many  reasons  for  the  quite  disproportionate  attention  paid  to  their  conflict.  But  the  international  media  frenzy  surrounding  Yasser  Arafat’s  dying  days,  and  the  accompanying  diplomatic  flurry  in  many  capitals,  reminds  us  that  Arafat  himself  has  been  one  of  the  reasons.  More  than  any  other  key  player  in  the  drama  for  the  past  four  decades,  he  has  worked  desperately  to  globalise  and  dramatise  the  con  flict,  and  thus  perpetuate  it.   This  suited  Arafat,  and  those  who  supported  him,  because  it  kept  them  in  power  and  because  it  prolonged  the  “armed  struggle”  against  Israel  while  enabling  him  to  say  he  was  pursuing  peace.  Yet  to  greater  and  lesser  degrees,  four  Israeli  prime  ministers  -  Yitzhak  Rabin,  Shimon  Peres,  Binyamin  Netanyahu  and  Ehud  Barak  -  and  the  majority  of  Israelis  accepted  Arafat’s  leadership,  and  either  overlooked  his  duplicity  and  chameleon-like  illusion  ism,  or  suppressed  their  scepticism.  They  -  and  many  friends  of  Israel  -  did  so  because  they  desperately  hoped  for  peace.  But  the  hopes  were  misplaced  and  eight  years  of  Oslo  gave  way  to  Arafat’s  four  years  of  intifada.  The  results  were  bitter  for  Israel,  and  disastrously  tragic  for  the  Palestinians.   Among  the  long-term  challenges  facing  the  Palestinians,  therefore,  is  to  overcome  the  Arafat  legacies  of  corruption,  abuse  of  power,  hatred  of  the  Jews,  and  the  poisonous  fantasy  of  destroying  Israel  by  terror  or  by  insisting  on  the  right  of  return  for  the  Palestinian  refugees.  Which  is  another  way  of  saying  that  finally,  after  all  their  failures,  Palestinian  society  must  learn  from  history,  as  in  its  own  way  must  the  Israeli  leadership  -  on  the  left  and  right.   INEVITABLY  at  this  time  speculation  about  the  future  is  rife,  but  not  very   helpful.  What  can  be  said  is  that  of  all  the  damage  Arafat  and  the  intifada  inflicted  on  Palestinian  society,  “the  gravest...  is  the  growing  prevalence  of  a  negative  culture  that  glorifies  death  and  treats  reality  as  predestined  fate,   from  which  one  cannot  extract  oneself”.   That  conclusion  came  recently,  not  from  an  Israeli,  but  from  Ashraf  Al  Ajrami,  a  columnist  for  the  Palestinian  daily,  Al-Ayam  (1/10/04).   However  difficult,  eliminating  the  extremist  death  culture  Arafat  promot  ed  in  the  Palestinian  media  and  in  the  Palestinian  schools  must  be  the  first   order  of  the  day  for  any  moderate  Palestinian  leadership,  alongside  fighting  and  defeating  their  own  terrorists.   Of  all  the  damage  Arafat  and  the  intifada  inflicted  on  Israeli  society,  the  gravest  was  the  widespread  erosion  of  trust  in  any  Palestinian  negotiating   partner.   That  any  hope  still  persists  speaks  to  the  deep  longing  for  peace  among  Israelis.  Yet  as  Uri  Dromi,  a  former  spokesman  for  Yitzhak  Rabin,  recalled  this  week,  Arafat’s  speeches  in  Arabic  as  far  back  as  1994  made  it  clear  he  did  not  intend  to  honour  the  Oslo  agreements.  Dromi  asked  pointedly:  “[Has  Arafat]  been  the  sole  obstacle  to  peace  or  [has]  he...  simply  been  represent  ing  ...  all  Palestinian  leaders?  Can  we  sit  down  with  people  who  ...  will  for  once  keep  their  word?  Personally,  I’m  not  holding  my  breath.”   Dromi’s  questions  and  fears  are  timely  and  valid.  But  as  Arafat’s  whole  life  demonstrated,  the  Middle  East  conflict  is  not  always  about  objective  analysis  and  historical  justice.  In  a  media  age  it  is  also  about  perceptions,  illusions  and   audiences.   Against  that  background,  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  faces  chal  lenges  of  his  own,  among  them,  it  should  be  hoped,  are  lessons  learned  from  the  abortive  handover  of  power  by  Arafat  to  Abu  Mazen  last  year,  a  transition  which  even  Sharon’s  closest  supporters  admit  he  could  have  done  more  to  support.   So  when  the  post-Arafat  dust  settles,  Sharon  will  have  to  tread  a  fine  line.  He  must  proceed  with  his  disengagement  plan,  yet  engage  moderate  Pales  tinians  in  working  it  out.  He  will  want  to  seize  the  high  ground  as  the  peace  maker  while  protecting  the  lives  of  Israel’s  citizens.  And  he  will  have  to  avoid  direct  intervention  in  the  Palestinians’  internal  conflicts,  and  yet  strive  to  strengthen  the  moderates.   Only  when  those  moderate  Palestinian  leaders  emerge  and  show  they  care  about  their  own  people  more  than  Arafat  did,  can  Israel  again  give  peace  a   chance. ",2004-11-12
"  Edwardian  artists  and   wealthy  Jewish  ladies   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   JEWISH  artists,  Australian  and  Eng  lish,  and  rich  and  poor  Jewish  fami  lies  in  Britain  have  a  prominent  place  in  a  new  exhibition  of  140  paintings,  sculptures  and  ballet  cos   tumes  called  The  Edwardians:  Secrets  and  desires  at  the  National  Gallery  of  Australia  (NGA)  in  Canberra.   The  Edwardian  period,  from  1901  to  just  before  World  War  I,  was  a  time  when  many  in  Britain  sought  to  shake  off  the  sombre  stuffiness  of  the  reign  of  Queen  Victoria  to  create  a  new  life  of  glamour,  opulence  and  artistic  and  social  change.   The  Jewish  contributions,  to  what  NGA  director  Brian  Kennedy  says  is  the  first  major  exhibition  of  Edwardian  art  anywhere  in  the  world  for  20  years,  include  six  works  by  Emmanuel  Phillips  Fox,  bom  in  1865  in  Melbourne  to  a  Jewish  pho  tographer  and  his  artist  wife.   Fox’s  paintings  include  nudes   and  attractive  scenes  of  comfortable  middle-class  life  in  London  and  Paris.   In  sharp  contrast,  the  works  of  Mark  Gertler,  bom  in  Spitalfields,  in  London’s  East  End,  portray  the  dep  rivation  and  isolation  of  Jewish  immigrants  in  Britain.

One  of  Britain’s  best-known  artists,  Sir  William  Rothenstein,  helped  Gertler  escape  the  ghetto   and  to  achieve  success  as  an  artist   among  the  well-to-do  intellectuals  of  the  Bloomsbury  group.   Among  famous  personalities  portrayed  in  this  exhibition  are  composer  Percy  Grainger,  Dame  Nellie  Melba  and  author  Virginia  Woolf;  but  two  of  the  biggest  and  most  glamorous  portraits  are  of  wealthy  Jewish  women  perhaps  not  so  well  known  to  the  general  public.   John  Singer  Sargent’s  vision  of  Almina,  daughter  of  Asher  Wertheimer,  a  wealthy  art  dealer  in  London’s  Bond  Street,  portrays  her  following  a  highly  fashionable  trend  in  the  early  1900s.

"  Can  I  quit  being  Jewish?   ASK  THE  RABBI   RABBI  RITCHIE  MOSS   Q  ALTHOUGH  I  was  raised  in  a   traditional  home,  had  a  brit  milah  and  a  bar  mitzvah,  I  have  never  had  any  faith  or  “religious”  belief.  I  am  now  aged  34,  and  would  describe  myself  as  an  atheist.  I  have  no  wish  to  be  buried  in  a  Jewish  cemetery  (and  my  will  makes  this  clear)  and  have  married  a  non-Jew  in  a  civil  ceremony.   My  question  is,  can  I  consider  myself  officially  non-Jewish,  by  effectively  opting-out,  or  do  I  need  some  sort  of  form  or  dispensation  to  be  officially  no  longer  Jewish?   u  Many  thanks  for  your  help  with   what  is  perhaps  an  unusual  ques   tion.   EDWARD   A  I  WOULD  like  to  help  you,  but   I  feel  there’s  nothing  I  can  do.   According  to  your  question,  you  have  done  everything  possible  to  negate  your  Jewishness:  in  practice  you  do  not  keep  Jewish  tradition;  in  belief  you  are  an  atheist;  in  family  life  you  have  married  a  non-Jew  and  thus  won’t  have  Jewish  children;  and  even  in  death  you  are  determined  not  to  be  buried  in  a  Jewish  ceme  tery.   One  would  think  that  all  this   would  be  enough  to  confirm  your  un-Jewishness.  But  no!   For  some  reason,  you  are  still  unsatisfied:  you  still  feel  Jewish!  So  much  so,  you  feel  you  need  official  dispensation!   And  so,  being  an  atheist,  who  do  you  turn  to  to  solve  this  problem?  A  doctor?  A  psychiatrist?  The  civil  celebrant  that  married  you?  No!  ...   You  turn  to  a  rabbi!   I’m  reminded  of  the  child  who   ran  away  from  home,  but  ended  up  just  going  around  and  around  the  block  because  his  parents  told  him  never  to  cross  the  road  by  himself.   I’m  sorry,  Edward.  There  is  nothing  more  you  can  do.  You  are  as  Jewish  as  Moses,  Ariel  Sharon  and  the  Chief  Rabbi  of  Wales.  In   fact,  it  seems  that  being  Jewish  is  the  most  dominant  (albeit  nega  tive)  factor  of  your  personality.  It  is  even  influencing  the  place  you  want  to  be  buried!  (Why  would  an  atheist  care  about  where  they  are  buried?)   Edward,  Jewishness  is  not  a  belief,  a  feeling,  a  conviction  or  a  lifestyle.  It  is  who  we  are.  We  can  either  celebrate  it  or  fight  against  it.  But  it  will  always  be  there.  So  why   not  celebrate  it?   Ritchie  Moss  is  rabbi  of  the  Chinuch   Foundation,  Sydney.

"  Shul  opens  in  Stalin’s  Jewish  ‘homeland’   btalin  has  long  been  dead,  but  his  Jewish  region  lives  on,  writes  SUE  HSKOFF.   The  three  ceremonies  mark  “an  even  greater  achievement”,  the  “victory  over  the  darkness  of   communism”.   BERELLAZAR  Chabad’s  chief  rabbi  in  Russia   THE  odd  story  of  Stalin's  Russ   ian  homeland  for  the  Jews  has  taken  another  strange  twist.  The  ribbon-cutting  ceremony  at  the  two-storey  Moorish-style  syna  gogue  in  Birobidzhan  before  Rosh  Hashanah  was  the  highlight  of  a  week  long  celebration  of  the  70th  anniver  sary  of  the  Jewish  Autonomous  Region  (JAR),  an  area  in  Russia’s  far  east  that  Stalin  declared  a  secular  Jew  ish  homeland  in  1934  to  divert  Soviet  Jews  from  Palestine.   One  of  three  such  openings  in  Russia’s  far  east,  it  followed  the  unveiling  of  a  bronze  statue  of  Sholem  Aleichem  on  the  city’s  main  boulevard,  Sholem  Aleichem  Street.   Those  openings  put  Chabad’s  stamp  on  the  Russian  far  east,  solidi  fying  the  movement’s  position  as  the  leading  Jewish  religious  organisation   in  the  former  Soviet  Union.   Chabad’s  chief  rabbi  in  Russia,  Berel  Lazar,  flew  in  from  Moscow,  hopping  from  city  to  city  across  the  region,  cutting  ribbons  and  delivering  speeches  at  each  shul  opening.   The  three  ceremonies  mark,  he  said,  “an  even  greater  achievement”,  referring  to  what  he  called  the  “victo  ry  over  the  darkness  of  communism”.   On  September  8,  a  100-year-old  synagogue  building  in  Vladivostok,  used  for  many  years  as  a  chocolate  factory,  was  formally  returned  by  the  government  to  the  local  Jewish  com  munity,  headed  by  Chabad  Rabbi   Menachem  Raskin.   The  next  day  in  Khabarovsk,  an  elegant  $3-million  synagogue  build  ing  was  opened,  and  the  day  after  that,  Birobidzhan’s  shul  opened  its  doors.   In  a  manner  unheard  of  elsewhere   in  Russia,  the  Khabarovsk  regional  government  underwrote  half  the  building  costs  for  that  city’s  new  shul,   and  Birobidzhan’s  regional  govern  ment  contributed  to  its  synagogue.   The  synagogue  opening  in  Biro  bidzhan  was  attended  by  a  star-stud  ded  roster  of  the  region’s  political  leadership,  many  of  whom,  including  the  city’s  mayor,  are  themselves  Jewish.   “Today  we’re  opening  the  region’s  first  kosher  synagogue,”  said  Gover  nor  Nikolai  Volkov,  as  he  greeted  200  spectators  outside  the  just-painted  synagogue  building  last  Friday.  “That  says  a  lot.  The  JAR  is  a  national  region,  and  now  the  Jews  can  develop   their  own  culture.”   Birobidzhan,  population  80,000,  is  laden  with  Jewish  trappings.   Yiddish  is  everywhere:  on  store  signs,  on  every  official  government  document,  in  the  local  newspaper  —  even  at  the  train  station,  Yiddish  writ  ing  is  the  first  thing  visitors  see  when  they  arrive  in  the  city.   But  the  linguistic  clues  are  rem  nants  of  a  deliberate  attempt  by  the   Soviet  State  in  the  1930s  to  subvert   Zionism  and  Jewish  religious  life  by,  on  one  hand,  pouring  money  and  political  support  into  this  tiny  “Jewish   national  homeland”  5000  kilometres  and  seven  times  zones  east  of  Moscow,  while  on  the  other  hand  ruthlessly  stamping  out  Hebrew  and  discourag  ing  Jewish  ritual  observance.   In  the  early  years  of  the  region’s  existence,  Yiddish  theatre,  music  and  literature  flourished  in  the  JAR.   More  than  40,000  Jews  from  all  over  the  world,  including  the  United  States  and  even  Palestine,  answered  Stalin’s  call  to  escape  urban  squalor  and  create  a  “New  Socialist  Jew”,  work  ing  the  land  in  collectivist  fraternity.   Propaganda  posters  from  the  1930s  and  early  1940s  are  remarkably  similar  to  Zionist  posters  from  the  same  era,  exhorting  Diaspora  Jewry  to   Rabbi  Berel  Lazar  opening  the   Birobidzhan  synagogue.  Photo:  JTA   help  build  “Palestine”  —  but  in  Russia.   Unlike  Palestine,  however,  Biro  bidzhan’s  experiment  failed.   In  1936  Stalin’s  purges  thinned  the  ranks  of  the  region’s  Jewish  leadership.   In  1948-49  the  Yiddish  schools  were  closed,  the  theatre  was  shut  down  and  many  actors  executed,  and  the  state  library’s  extensive  Judaica   section  was  burned.  The  last  func   tioning  synagogue  was  destroyed  in  a  mysterious  fire  in  the  1950s.   After  Stalin  died,  Jewish  life  grew  more  public  as  the  decades  passed.   However  once  the  doors  of  the  Soviet  Union  opened  in  1989,  10,000  of  Birobidzhan’s  estimated  12,000  Jews  immigrated  to  Israel,  the  highest  aliyah  rate  in  the  country.   But  in  a  phenomenon  noted  throughout  the  former  Soviet  Union,  the  Jewish  population  of  the  region  grows  even  as  more  Jews  leave.  Jewish  Agency  figures  place  the  current  number  at  2000,  although  local  Jew  ish  community  officials  insist  it  is   closer  to  6000.   The  leading  local  newspaper,  the  Birobidzhaner  Shtern,  resumed  pub  lishing  a  Yiddish  section  more  than  a  decade  ago.  Yiddish  and  Jewish  cul  ture  and  traditions  are  taught  as  part  of  the  curriculum  in  one  of  the  city’s  public  schools.   The  local  Jewish  community,  part  of  the  Chabad-affiliated  Federation  of  Jewish  Communities  of  Russia,  spon  sors  the  usual  offering  of  classes  and  clubs  in  Hebrew,  Jewish  and  Israeli  subjects.  Religious  life  received  a  boost  two  years  ago  with  the  arrival  of  Chabad  emissaries  Rabbi  Mordechai  Sheiner  and  his  wife,  Esther.   Locals  see  nothing  unusual  about  non-Jewish  children’s  dance  troupes  performing  the  hora  to  Israeli  music  in  the  city  square.   “Dancing  and  singing  has  always  been  a  part  of  our  life  here,”  says  Yele  na  Belyaeva,  a  non-Jewish  woman  who  teaches  Yiddish  and  Hebrew  in   the  local  teacher’s  college.   The  difference  is  that  since  pere  stroika  Israeli  and  Hebrew  culture  have  been  added  into  the  mix.  “Before   that,  it  was  just  Yiddish.’   JTA ",2004-09-24

"  World  Jewish  population   flattens  at  13  million   DINA  KRAFT   TEL  AVIV  -  On  one  hand,  the  num  ber  of  Diaspora  Jews  is  declining  and   the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  is   emboldening  antisemites.   On  the  other,  Jews  are  relatively  affluent,  educated  and  involved.   These  findings  are  included  in  a  report  on  the  state  of  the  Jewish  peo  ple  by  the  Jewish  People  Policy  Plan  ning  Institute  -  a  think-tank  chaired  by  former  US  envoy  Dennis  Ross.   The  world  Jewish  population  is  approaching  zero  population  growth   at  13  million.  Between  1970  and  2003   the  total  world  population  increased  by  70  per  cent,  while  the  Jewish  popu  lation  increased  by  just  two  per  cent.   Diaspora  figures  are  declining  because  of  low  birth  rates,  a  rise  in  interfaith  marriage  and  an  ageing  population,  according  to  the  report.   It  recommended  a  long-term  approach:  improving  institutions,  leadership  and  decision-making.  It  also  urged  aliyah,  spending  money  from  Diaspora  Jews  on  projects  aimed  at  building  Jewish  identity  in  Israel,  demanding  that  Israel  step  up  reli  gious  pluralism  by  normalising  the   status  of  non-Orthodox  movements   in  the  country  and  making  Jewish   education  more  affordable.   It  found  that  92  per  cent  of  the  world’s  Jews  live  in  the  wealthiest  fifth  of  the  world’s  population.   Intermarriage  is  highest  in  Russia  and  Ukraine  at  80  per  cent.  In  Ger   many  and  Hungary  it  is  60  per  cent,  in  the  US  54,  France,  Britain  and  Argentina  45,  Canada  35  Australia  22,  South  Africa  20  and  Mexico  10  per  cent.  In  Israel  the  rate  is  5  per  cent,  mostly  from  the  former  Soviet  Union.   The  report  found  an  inverse  rela  tionship  between  attendance  at  dayschools  and  intermarriage.  In  Israel  97  per  cent  of  Jewish  children  attend  a  Jewish  school,  in  South  Africa  and  Mexico  85  per  cent,  in  Britain  67,  Australia  65,  Argentina  60,  Canada  55,   US  29  and  Russia  and  Ukraine  15.   Among  other  findings:   •  The  US’  pro-Israel  leanings  antag  onise  other  countries  and  generate  hostility  against  Jewish  communities.   •  Antisemitism  is  gaining  currency.  •  In  the  last  20  years  enrolment  in  Jewish  dayschools  has  grown.   According  to  estimates,  if  six  million  Jews  had  not  been  murdered  in  the  Holocaust,  the  world  Jewish  population  would  number  between   cuiu  ou  lmuiuii  luuay.   JIM ",2004-07-09
"  US  Jewish  influence  exceeds  sheer  numbers   PARTISAN   SAM  UPSKI   Evidence  from  surveys  and  observers  is  that   Israel,  antisemitism  and  the  war  against   terrorism  may  well  be  decisive  enough  for   significant  numbers  of   (Jewish  voters...  to   abandon  their   (traditional  Democrat   allegiances  and  vote   for  Bush.   LTHOUGH  it’s  a  time  for  asking  at  least  four  questions,  let’s  restrict  this  inquiry  to  just  one:  will  American  Jews   vote  for  George  W  Bush  or  John  Kerry   come  November?   For  American  Jews  this  presidential  election  is  different  from  all  other  elec  tions  because  it’s  the  first  since  Sep  tember  11,  the  second  intifada  and  the  rise  of  what  has  been  termed  the  “new  antisemitism”.   Of  course,  American  Jews  will  vote  in  varied  ways,  as  they  always  have  done,  on  a  whole  range  of  domestic  issues  such  as  the  economy,  health  care  and  education.  And  it’s  always  simplis  tic  to  speculate  about  “the  Jewish  vote”   as  if  it  were  monolithic.   It’s  not  But  the  evidence  from  sur   veys  and  observers  this  year  is  that  Israel,  antisemitism  and  the  war  against  terrorism  may  well  be  decisive  enough  for  significant  numbers  of  Jewish  voters,  even  if  they  will  still  fall  far  short  of  a  majority,  to  abandon  their  traditional  Democrat  allegiances  and  vote  for  the  Republicans’  Bush  against  Kerry.   If  that  does  happen,  it  could  help  to  swing  a  close  election  to  Bush.  At  this  point,  readers  may  be  wondering  how  Jews,  representing  just  three  per  cent  of  the  American  electorate,  can  be  poten  tially  so  influential.   The  answer  is  that  Jewish  votes  are  more  potent  than  their  numbers  because  of  location,  turnout  and  activism.  Location  matters  in  real  estate.  It  certainly  matters  in  US  presi  dential  politics.  American  Jews  are  concentrated  in  the  big  cities  in  the  most  populous  states,  such  as  New  York,  California,  Illinois,  Florida  and  Pennsylvania.   In  fact,  the  vast  majority  of  Ameri  can  Jews  live  in  the  12  most  populous  states;  nine  of  these  states  account  for  212  electoral  votes,  or  78  per  cent  of   US  President  George  W  Bush  (right)  and  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  laugh  together  during  a  news  conference  last  year.  Jerusalem  and  Washington  will  be   watching  how  US  Jews  vote  come  November.  .Photo:  Paul  Morse/White  House   the  total  needed  to  win  the  White  House.   So  let’s  follow  the  arithmetic.  Since   the  president  gets  to  the  White  House  not  by  a  simple  majority  of  individual  voters,  but  by  winning  a  majority  of  electoral  votes,  and  since  the  more  populous  states  have  more  such  votes,  and  since  winning  a  state  even  by  a  handful  of  votes  means  winning  all  of  its  electoral  votes,  a  shift  in  Jewish  political  behaviour  in  these  key  states  could  be  significant.   As  the  polling  data  shows  that  the  voting  patterns  remain  close  to  those  in  2000,  another  tight  election  is  expected.  In  some  states  such  as  Flori  da  and  Pennsylvania  the  outcome  could  hinge  on  a  few  thousand  votes.   The  second  reason  for  the  dispro  portionate  impact  of  Jewish  voting  is  that  they  turn  out  on  election  days  in   much  larger  numbers  than  other  eth  nic  groups  and  the  general  population.   In  a  non-compulsory  system  where  less  than  50  per  cent  of  the  eligible  vot  ers  actually  go  to  the  polls,  this  magni  fies  the  impact  of  those  who  cast  a   ballot.   Finally,  Jews  are  more  active  in  pol  itics  generally,  participating  as  organis  ers,  fundraisers,  donors  and  ideas  merchants,  not  just  in  the  campaign  or  on  election  day.  This  adds  to  their  influence  on  the  way  others  cast  their   votes.   But  why  might  Bush  benefit  from  these  factors?  True,  he  only  won  19  per  cent  of  Jewish  votes  in  2000,  and  many  traditional  Jewish  Democrats,  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  are  virulently  anti   Bush.   But  in  1980  Ronald  Reagan  won  38  per  cent  of  Jewish  votes  -  the  highest   for  many  years  before  and  since  —  showing  that  in  certain  circumstances  the  Jewish  vote  will  swing.  This  means  that  the  Bush  campaign  is  hoping  to  lift  his  Jewish  numbers  to,  say,  30  or  35  per  cent,  especially  in  critical  states.   The  swing  issue  revolves  around  Bush’s  pro-Israel  policies  as  they  unfolded  after  September  11.  While  American  Jews  are  not  automatically  pro-Israel,  and  for  many  it’s  not  the  determining  concern,  it  is  salient  for  many  others.   This  has  its  own  ironies  because  one  of  the  reasons  Bush  failed  to  do  well  in  2000  among  Jews  was  the  view  that  he  would  follow  the  unsympa  thetic  line  towards  Israel  that  his  father  and  secretary  of  state  James  Baker  had  pursued  when  in  office   between  1989  and  1993.   September  11,  however,  changed  many  things.  Although  not  always  consistent,  Bush  has  generally  proven  to  be  even  more  pro-Israel  than  Bill  Clinton;  he  has  appointed  pro-Israel  advisers  and  he  has  taken  a  hard  line   against  Islamist  terror  in  the  Arab   Israeli  conflict.   Kerry  and  his  camp  know  this.  They  will  go  all  out  to  hold  onto  Jew  ish  votes  by  emphasising  their  sup  port  for  Israel,  proposing  new  plans  for  peace  and  promising  to  fight  anti  semitism  everywhere.  They  will  also  highlight  the  concerns  about  Bush’s  support  for  church-based  welfare  and  his  conservative  social  agenda.   But  Bush  starts  from  such  a  low   base  of  previous  Jewish  support  that  even  a  relatively  small  increase  this   time  could  make  a  difference.  Rest  assured,  therefore,  that  Jerusalem  will  be  watching  what  American  Jews  do  this  November,  just  as  much  as  Washington.

"  Bush,  Kerry  begin   RON  KAMPEAS   WASHINGTON  -  Now  that  it’s  down   to  John  Kerry  versus  George  W  Bush,  American  Jews  -  prominent  in  swing   states  in  what  could  be  a  dose  election   -  have  begun  to  receive  plenty  of  atten   tion.   “Anything  that  moves  a  few  hun  dred  or  a  few  thousand  voters  one  way  or  another  can  cause  a  seismic  shift,”  said  John  Zogby,  a  pollster  who  says  the  doseness  of  the  November  presi  dential  election  is  leading  opinion  gatherers  to  focus  more  than  ever  on  small  groups,  such  as  the  Jews.   The  fight  will  mirror  the  larger  bat  tle  for  the  election,  where  Kerry  will  emphasise  domestic  issues  and  Presi  dent  Bush  will  stress  his  foreign  policy  and  security  record.   Among  Jews,  Democratic  strate  gists  will  stress  health  care,  the  econo  my  and  the  proposed  amendment  banning  gay  marriage.  Republicans  will  stress  Bush’s  pro-Israel  record  and   his  war  on  terrorism.   Jews  still  lean  strongly  Democratic,  pollsters  say,  but  even  small  shifts  could  change  history.   “If,  instead  of  72  per  cent  of  the  Jewish  vote,  Kerry  were  to  get  69  per  cent,  it  could  have  an  impact  in  Penn  sylvania,  Florida,  Arizona,”  Zogby  said  -  states  that  were  won  by  tiny  margins   in  2000.   Florida’s  electoral  votes  in  2000   ultimately  threw  the  national  race  to  Bush,  even  though  A1  Gore  received  the  plurality  of  the  national  vote.   Kerry,  the  Democratic  senator  from  Massachusetts,  swept  nine  of  the  10  states  in  last  week’s  Super  Tuesday  pri  maries,  clinching  the  Democratic   nomination.   “There’s  going  to  be  about  10  bat  deground  states  and  in  a  number  of  those  places  there’s  a  large  Jewish  com  munity,”  said  Matt  Brooks  of  the  Republican  Jewish  Coalition,  dting  Florida,  Pennsylvania,  Ohio,  Illinois,  Michigan  and  Missouri.   Marc  Radcot,  who  chairs  the  Bush  Cheney  campaign,  is  optimistic  that  Bush  would  do  better  than  the  19  per   cent  support  which  he  earned  from  Jews  in  2000,  because  of  the  President’s  strong  pro-Israel  record.   “They  have  been  inclined  to  sup  port  Democrats,”  Racicot  said  of  Jew  ish  voters.  “But  the  President’s  policies  and  values  in  regard  to  the  Middle  East  lead  to  the  possibility  to  be  much  more  successful  in  the  Jewish  community.”   Bring  it  on,  say  the  Democrats.  “Things  have  not  looked  as  good  for  Democrats  in  the  Jewish  community  for  a  number  of  years,”  said  Ira  For  man  of  the  National  Jewish  Democra  tic  Council.   Kerry’s  strength  among  Jews  was  reflected  in  exit  polls  last  week,  when  he  polled  better  among  Jews  than  among  non-Jews  in  four  out  of  five   states.   “For  the  first  time  in  my   life,  a  significant   segment  of  the  Jewish   I  vote  is  up  for  grabs.   FRANK  LUN1Z  Republican  pollster   Forman  said  his  party  would  emphasise  what  all  pro-Israel  activists  agree  is  Kerry’s  exemplary  voting  record  in  19  years  in  the  Senate.   “If  s  good  to  be  a  Jewish  Democrat  today,”  he  said.   Forman  suggested  the  Democrat  strategy  would  be  first  to  say  Bush  and  Kerry  were  equals  on  Israel,  “and  then  we  pivot  to  the  domestic  issues”.   “They’re  on  the  wrong  side  of  the  community  on  the  fiscal  mess,  with  its  implications  for  social  programs,  for  feiture  of  stewardship  of  the  environ  ment,  destroying  the  wall  separating  Church  from  State,  choice,  energy,  nuclear  proliferation,”  Forman  said.   Hannah  Rosenthal  of  the  Jewish  Council  for  Public  Affairs  agreed  that  Jews  are  more  likely  to  vote  on  domes  tic  issues  this  year.   “On  issues  specific  to  Israel,  we’re  talking  about  a  win-win  situation,”  said  Rosenthal,  one  of  40  Jewish  lead  ers  who  met  Kerry  in  New  York  at  the   John  Kerry,  the  Democratic  candidate  for  the  US  presidential  election.   Photo:  JTA   weekend  “Jews  will  be  looking  at  pro  tection  of  privacy,  civil  liberties  protec  tions,  health  care,  women’s  rights.”   Those  were  all  issues  Kerry  stressed  in  his  victory  speech,  when  he  left  for  eign  policy  and  the  Iraq  war  for  brief   mentions  at  the  end   Forman  said  the  party  would  stress  Bush’s  push  to  ban  gay  marriage.  “Every  time  they  play  to  their  conser  vative  base,  they  alienate  the  Jewish  community,”  he  said.   Republicans  agreed  that  Kerry  was  strong  on  Israel,  but  suggested  that  Bush  was  stronger  and  that  Kerry  could  be  vulnerable  on  national  secu   rity,  where  Bush  has  advocated  tougher  measures  in  the  Patriot  Act   Brooks,  the  Republican  Jewish  leader,  suggested  that  Bush’s  commit   ment  to  Israel’s  security  would  trump  domestic  considerations  for  Jews.

"  Outrage  over  uni  paper’s  anti-Jewish  column   RACHEL  POMERANCE   NEW  YORK  -  The  annual  conference   of  the  Palestine  Solidarity  Movement  (PMS)  at  Duke  University  was  held  without  a  hitch  last  week,  but  contro  versy  erupted  immediately  after  its   conclusion.   An  inflammatory  editorial  in  The  Chronicle,  the  campus  newspaper,  has  prompted  an  outcry  by  offended  Jew   ish  activists.   “Regardless  of  your  political  stance  or  position  on  the  PSM  confer  ence,  it  is  impossible  to  ignore  the   unprecedented  outpouring  of  pro  Jewish,  pro-Israeli  support  in  defiance  of  free  speech  at  Duke,”  columnist  Philip  Kurian  wrote  in  an  opinion  article  titled  “The  Jews”.   “What  Jewish  suffering  -  along  with  exorbitant  Jewish  privilege  in  the  United  States  -  amounts  to  is  a  stilted,  one-dimensional  conversation  where   Jews  feel  the  overwhelming  sense  of   entitlement  not  to  be  criticised  or  offended,”  he  wrote.   “If  the  Duke  administration  had   buckled  under  the  influential  weight  of  the  Jewish  establishment  by  not   allowing  the  PSM  conference,  we  would  be  suffering  from  the  Orwellian  notion  of  consciousness,  where  the  only  ideas  that  matter  are  the  ones  espoused  by  the  powerful.”   Kurian  also  accused  Jews  of  exploiting  the  “Holocaust  industry”  for  political  gain.   Students  associated  with  Duke’s  Hillel  affiliate,  the  Freeman  Centre  for  Jewish  Life,  planned  to  ask  the  news  paper’s  advisory  board  to  hold  an  internal  investigation.   Originally,  Jewish  students  planned  to  call  for  the  resignation  of   The  Chronicle’s  editor.  While  some  students  still  think  the  editor  should  resign,  others  fear  that  such  a  demand  “plays  into  some  of  the  argu  ments  that  Philip  made,  that  we  con  trol  the  media”,  said  Rachael  Solomon,  student  president  of  the   Freeman  Centre.   The  students  hope  an  investigation  would  examine  The  Chronicle’sgener  al  coverage  of  events  surrounding  the  PSM  conference,  which  they  believe  showed  a  bias  against  the  Jewish  com  munity,  Solomon  said.

"  Louise  Rosenberg   Spinning  untold  yarns  of  Jewish  Australian  history   ORYANA  KAUFMAN   THE  name  Ned  Kelly  evokes  images  of  Australia's  bushranger  history,  but  few  people  have  heard  of  Edward  Davis,  a  Jewish  bushranger  of  the  same  period.   In  her  first  book,  Of  Folktales  and  Jewish  Folk  in  Australian  History,  Louise  Rosenberg  tells  stories  of  a  Jewish  woman  who  arrived  as  a  convict  on  the  First  Fleet,  married  a  military  leader  and  later  saved  the  colony  from  starva  tion,  the  Jews  of  Kangaroo  Valley,  a  Jewish  ghost  who  resented  an  Anglican  bishop  living  in  his  house,  ""Teddy  the  Jewboy""  -  the  leader  of  a  gang  of  bushrangers  -  and  other  contem  porary  stories.   And  who  better  to  tell  the  stories  than  Rosenberg,  90,  who  has  been  secretary  and  treasurer  of  the  Australian  Jewish  Historical  Society  for  over  25  years?   ""The  purpose  of  this  book  is  to  make  peo  ple  interested  in  Jewish  history,""  Rosenberg   told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.   ""So  much  has  happened  in  the  216  years  that  Jews  have  been  in  Australia.  There  have  been  success  stories  and  the  stories  that  we  are  not  so  proud  of  as  well,""  she  said.   ""It  is  a  true  chronicle  of  the  adventure,  mis  adventures  and  accomplishments  of  the  Jews  in  Australia,""  Rosenberg  wrote  in  the  preface   to  her  book.   About  Australia's  only  Jewish  bushranger,  Rosenberg  wrote:  ""He  played  the  part  of  an  Australian  Robin  Hood,  and  if  he  stripped  the  rich,  he  went  out  of  his  way  to  relieve  the  mis  ery  of  the  assigned  servant.   ""There  were  three  firm  rules  which  he  insisted  upon  before  he  accepted  a  member  of  his  gang:  anyone  could  be  held  up  except  fel   low  convicts  -  no  one  was  exempt,  not  even   Jews;  every  prospective  member  must  be  an  experienced  horseman;  members  could  carry   Cover  of   Of  Folktales  and  Jewish  Folk.   guns  if  they  wished  -  but  only  to  threaten  -  never  under  any  circumstances  must  they  be   used  to  kill.""   ""It's  important  that  history  is  told  in  a  fresh  way,  that  will  capture  people's  interest,""  Rosenberg  said.   The  book  traces  Jews  in  Australian  history  from  the  early  settler  days  until  today  -  with  a  strong  emphasis  on  the  early  20th  century  -  covering  great  contributions  of  particular  indi  viduals  and  their  families  made  to  society.   ""I  wanted  to  go  on  and  write  chapter  17  and  18,""  she  said.""  In  the  end  I  decided  to  save  the  rest  for  another  book.  It  might  be  a  trilo  gy.""   Despite  her  age,  Rosenberg's  doesn't  plan  to  sit  back  and  let  life  pass  her  by.  She  contin  ues  to  be  published  and  lectures  widely  on  Australian  Jewish  History.

"  ATHENS  2004   OQp   r   OLYMPIC  GAMES   PREVIEW   Fewer   Russian   Jewish   Olympians   LEV  KRICHEVSKY   MOSCOW  -  Jewish  immigration  to  Israel  has  bolstered  the  Jewish  State’s  Olympic  team,  but  it  has  greatly  reduced  the  number  of  Jews  competing  for  the  Russians  in  the  upcoming  Athens  games.   In  the  40  years  following  the  1952  Helsinki  games  -  in  which  the  Soviet  Union  competed  as  a  country  for  the  first  time  -  Jews  won  at  least  60  medals  for  the   Soviet  Olympic  team,  including  28  gold.   Soviet  Jews  were  especially  suc  cessful  in  fencing  -  taking  home  seven  Olympic  gold  -  in  addition  to  wrestling  and  yachting,  in  which  they  won  three  gold  medals  respectively.   The  peak  of  Jewish  Olympic   victories  for  the  Soviet  team  came  during  the  1960s  and  1970s:  of  the  28  gold  medals  Jews  won  for  the  USSR  between  1952  and  1992,  18  were  garnered  between  1960  and   1976.   After  that  period,  Jewish  partic  ipation  began  to  decline  as  a  result  of  state-sponsored  antisemitism.   As  for  the  Athens  games,  Sergei  Sharikov,  30,  who  won  two  Olympic  sabre  fencing  gold  medals  in  1996  and  2000,  is  the  only  confirmed  Jewish  athlete  on   the  Russian  team.   Mark  Rakita,  honorary  presi  dent  of  Maccabi  Russia,  who  won  an  Olympic  gold  medal  in  fencing  in  1964  in  Tokyo,  said  that  “some  of  the  athletes  may  not  be  open  about  their  Jewish  roots”,  although  he  added  that  the  situation  today  cannot  be  compared  to  his  own  experience  40  years  ago  as  a  lead   ing  Russian  fencer.

"  Making  gentle  inroads  into  Jewish-Muslim  dialogue   BRIDGE-building  between  Sydney*s  Jewish  and  Muslim  communities  is  taking  place  at  various  levels  -  one  of  them  being  through  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel’s  Interfaith  Dia  logue  Group.   The  group  was  set  up  two  years  ago  when  Rabbi  Allison  Conyer  met  Ridhwan  Mariot  at  the  Royal  North  Shore  Hospital’s  Interfaith  Volun  teer  Service.  Both  were  keen  to  talk.   “I  was  cautious  at  first  because  of   political  tensions  in  the  Middle  East,”  Mariot  admits,  “but  I  thought  it  was  worth  giving  it  a  go,  and  I  suggested  to  focus  first  on  spiritual  things  and  stay  away  from  political  issues.”   Rabbi  Conyer  agreed,  with  the  proviso  that  the  group  would  begin  discussing  religious  and  theological  concepts  and  practices,  and  would  broach  the  politics  of  the  Middle  East  only  after  the  group  had  built  up  trust  among  its  participants.   The  meetings  began  with  tenta  tive  exploration  of  specific  religious  topics,  such  as  the  relationship  of  each  faith  to  Abraham,  lifecycle  events  (such  as  birth  and  death),  God,  the  Messiah  and  the  afterlife.   “Dialogue  is  crucial  to  under  standing  between  our  communities,  especially  when  there  is  so  much  strife  in  the  Middle  East,  so  much  confusion  between  the  religious  imperatives  of  our  traditions  and  the  current  political  climate,”  Rabbi  Conyer  said.   Since  those  tentative  beginnings,  50  people  have  met,  either  at  the  tem  ple  or  at  venues  around  Sydney,   Members  of  the  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel  Interfaith  Dialogue  Group  enjoy  a   meal  in  a  succah.   including  the  Auburn  Mosque  and  at  a  family  picnic  at  Bicentenary  Park.   The  most  gratifying  outcome  has  been  the  many  strong  similarities  between  the  traditions  in  belief,  practice,  and  language.   I  “Dialogue  is  crucial  to   promote  understanding   between  our   communities”   RABBI  ALLISON  CONYER  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel   Today,  discussions  drift  freely  into  political  commentary,  with  both  Muslims  and  Jews  feeling  suffi  ciently  comfortable  to  express  their  opinions  and  respect  those  of  oth  ers,  even  if  disagreements  occur.   “It’s  been  interesting  from  both  our  points  of  view  because  it’s  been  good  to  see  what  the  other  thinks,”   Mariot  said.   Rabbi  Conyer:  “So  far  the  group  has  been  very  successful  in  that  it  has  maintained  a  core  group  of  Jews  and  Muslims  each  month,  as  well  as  attracting  newcomers  each  time  .”   The  group  is  considering  ways  of  reaching  a  broader  group  of  Jews  and  Muslims  within  the  greater  Syd  ney  community  to  inspire  others  to  engage  in  interfaith  dialogue.   Rabbi  Conyer  was  recently  invit  ed  to  present  a  workshop  at  the  Community  Harmony  Symposium,  sponsored  by  the  NSW  Community   Relations  Commission.   “It  proved  to  be  a  stimulating  and  productive  exchange  that  iden  tified  impediments  to  dialogue,  examined  ways  to  overcome  them  and  brainstormed  other  models  that  might  be  appropriate,”  Rabbi  Cony   er  said.   “Overall,  this  grassroots  initiative  has  been  a  breath  of  fresh  air  in  a   darkening  political  climate.” ",2004-01-16

"  THE  JEWISH  WOMEN  OF  RAVENSBRUCK   CONCENTRATION  CAMP   Rochelle  Saidel   University  of  Chicago  Press,  $35   RAVENSBRUCK  was  the  only  major  Nazi  concentration  camp  for  women.  A  minority  were  Jewish  and  these  women’s  testi  monies  are  the   slice  or  history  recorded  in  this  book.   It  is  a  history  of  record  which,  as  one  would  expect,  is  very  hard  to  read.  A  short  chapter  is  devoted  to  the  specific  issues  of  gender  and  women’s  bodies,  but  Saidel  does  not  try  to  make  an  issue  of  it.   In  such  dehumanised  environment,  the  experience  of  men  and  women,  Jews,  politicals  and  ""asocials""  was  little  distinguished  and  this  book  is  not  very  different  from  other  Holocaust  histories.

"  Jewish  News   The  Yarkon’s  murky  waters   THE  Jewish  National  Fund  (JNF)  of  Australia  is  right  to  spearhead  die   campaign  to  dean  up  the  Yarkon  River,  the  site  where  four  Australians  were  killed  and  scores  more  injured  in  the  1997  Maccabiah  bridge  dis  aster.  Maccabi  Australia  is  also  right  to  thrown  its  weight  behind  the  environmental  project  And  the  victims’  families  are  equally  right  to  express  their  concerns  about  the  project   These  are  not  mutually  exdusive  positions.  The  JNF  righdy  postponed  its  *■  fundraising  campaign  until  all  Maccabiah  compensation  claims  were  finalised   earlier  this  year  because  it  understood  the  sensitivity  of  the  issues  involved.   Now  that  the  Haifa  High  Court  has  approved  payment  of  the  remaining  $567,000,  the  JNF  believed  the  path  was  dear  to  begin  raising  funds  for  the   rehabilitation  of  the  river.   Except  for  one  festering  issue:  Yoram  Eyal,  one  of  five  men  convicted  of  negligence  over  the  bridge  disaster,  remains  to  this  day  the  head  of  Kfar  Mac  cabiah,  the  village  where  the  athletes  traditionally  stay  during  the  games.   Even  though  Maccabi  Australia  has  righdy  dedded  that  the  Australian  team  will  not  stay  at  the  village  while  Eyal  remains  in  charge,  his  presence  remains  an  affront  to  the  victims’  families  and  a  lingering  insult  to  Australian  Jewry.  Moreover,  Eyal  is  also  head  of  the  North  American  desk  of  Maccabi  World  Union  (MWU)  and,  as  such,  sits  on  the  MWU  executive,  to  which  the  *  organising  committee  for  the  2005  Maccabiah  reports.  Therefore,  although  he   served  his  six-month  community-service  sentence,  Yoram  Eyal  will  have  a  not  insignificant  role  in  the  running  of  the  next  Maccabiah.   Colin  Elterman,  whose  daughter  Sasha  underwent  numerous  operations  because  she  ingested  the  Yarkon’s  toxic  waters,  understandably  remains  com  mitted  to  pursuing  the  dismissal  of  EyaL  Unfortunately,  however,  his  cam  paign  to  rouse  support  within  MWU  and  the  other  national  Maccabi  organisations  appears  to  have  fallen  on  deaf  ears.   BUT  -  and  this  is  the  crux  -  Greg  Small,  Yetty  Bennet,  Warren  Zines  and   Elizabeth  Sawicki  did  not  die  because  of  the  poisoned  Yarkon  waters.  While  it  is  true  that  Yetty  Bennett  and  Greg  Small  drowned  in  the  dis  aster  and  Warren  Zines  and  Elizabeth  Sawicki  died  weeks  later  after  ingesting  v.  the  Yarkon’s  poisonous  waters,  they  should  never  have  plunged  into  the   Yarkon  in  the  first  place.   In  short,  it  was  the  bridge,  not  the  river,  which  was  at  fault  -  despite  the  fact  that  the  river’s  toxicity  compounded  the  problem.   Therefore,  the  issue  of  cleaning  up  the  Yarkon  is  first  and  foremost  an  envi  ronmental  matter  affecting  more  than  two  million  Israelis.  The  bridge  would  have  likely  claimed  Australian  victims  no  matter  where  it  had  been  built  It  was  the  fact  that  the  bridge  buckled  and  then  broke  which  was  the  root  of  the  tragedy,  not  the  fact  that  it  plunged  the  Australian  team  into  the  river  below  it  Though  this  is  an  extremely  sensitive  issue,  it  is  important  to  understand  the  fine  line  between  the  two  in  order  to  appreciate  that  the  JNF  is  supporting   a  worthwhile  cause.   But  the  JNF,  in  going  about  its  business  as  an  environmental  organisation,  x  must  understand  that  by  deciding  to  rehabilitate  this  particular  river,  it  is   touching  a  still-raw  nerve  for  some  Australian  Jews.  And  it  must  also  accept  that  it  will  find  it  difficult  to  satisfy  the  concerns  of  all  the  victims’  families.   It  is  entirely  understandable  to  query,  as  did  Yetty  Bennett’s  son  Mark,  why  Australians  are  helping  clean  up  a  polluted  river  in  Israel.  Maccabi  Australia  president  Phil  Filler  best  sums  up  the  choice:  “We  could  do  nothing  and  be  bitter  for  the  rest  of  our  lives”  or  “roll  up  our  sleeves  and  say,  ‘No  more.  What  happened  should  never  occur  in  the  future.’”   The  fact  remains  that  the  ethos  of  the  JNF  for  the  past  102  years  has  been  “to  develop  and  conserve  the  land  of  Israel  for  the  benefit  of  the  Jewish  peo  ple”.  The  rehabilitation  of  the  Yarkon  River  fits  that  mission  statement   The  iconic  JNF  Blue  Box,  which  has  been  around  virtually  since  the  organ  isation’s  founding  in  December  1901,  has  raised  millions  of  dollars  from  Diaspora  Jews  for  Israel’s  environment  At  root  this  campaign  to  raise  $5  mil  lion  in  Australia  to  help  rehabilitate  the  Yarkon  is  no  different   However,  the  JNF,  Maccabi  Australia  and  all  the  other  Israeli  organisations  involved  in  rehabilitating  the  Yarkon  River  must  accept  that  no  matter  the  degree  of  sensitivity  they  offer  the  families  of  the  victims  in  particular,  and  Australian  Jews  in  general,  the  bridge  disaster  remains  the  most  traumatic  event  in  the  history  of  Australian  Jewry.

"  wish  youth  take  to  the  tents   UHtAMA  KAUFMAN   FOR  some  the  thought  of  abseiling  down  a  sheer  cliff  face  is  not  the  epito  me  of  a  good  time.  For  them,  perhaps,  ft's  the  communal  meals  and  campfires  at  the  Zionist  youth  camps  that  appeal.   Whether  it's  for  the  food  or  the  fun,  summer  camps  -  which  attract  nearly  2000  young  Jews  each  year  -  seem  to  have  found  the  recipe  for  success.   The  camps  are  held  around  Australia  by  the  five  major  youth  move  ments  -  Betar,  B'nei  Akiva,  Habonim  Dror,  Hineni  and  Netzer  -  who  accept  members  between  the  age  of  nine  through  to  university.

He  adds:  ""If  we  are  interested  in  Jewish  continuity,  living  breathing  Judaism  can't  be  taught  in  the  confines  of  a  classroom;  it  is  basically  an  experi  ential  experience.   ""The  graduates  of  these  youth  movements  contribute  the  largest  por  tion  of  leadership  in  the  community  through  their  volunteerism.   ""The  movement  summer  camps,  and  their  other  activities,  are  the  best  way  that  we  have  for  youth  to  partici  pate  in  this  positive  phenomena.""   Dr  Weiser,  who  attended  B'nei  Akiva  since  the  age  of  12,  met  his  wife  through  the  movement.   Another  long-time  Zionist  camper  and  former  member  of  Betar  is  Australian  Zionist  Youth  Council  (AZYC)  chairperson  Arik  Kogan.  The  AZYC  is  the  roof  body  for  Australia's  Zionist  youth  movements.   Kogan,  22,  expects  a  very  successful  summer  this  year  and  says  attendance  numbers  have  increased  since  last  year.   ""We're  really  happy  about  that.  Numbers  are  up  by  a  few  hundred  on  previous  years,""  says  Kogan.   ""  It  is  important  for  Jewish  kids  to  be  together,  to  interact  and  feel  like  the  are  part  of  something  bigger.  They  come  on  camps  to  learn  about  Judaism,  Israel,  Zionism,  the  respective  movements'  ideologies  and  leadership.   ""They  learn  to  be  leaders  within  the  movements  and  within  their  social,  uni  versity  and  communal  lives,""  he  said.   Kogan  is  currently  based  in  Melbourne  but  will  move  to  Sydney  in   2005.   Habonim  Dror  Sydney  camp  direc  tor  Daniel  Fink  said  he  would  recom  mend  the  camp  ""ten  times  over"".

""Habo  has  played  the  most  influen  tial  role  of  all  the  organisations  I've  been  involved  in.  It  shaped  who  I  am  and  what  I  am  involved  in  and  it's  given  me  a  fantastic  basis  for  living  life  and  having  a  social  circle,""  said  Fink.

"  Following  the  great  flood,  when  men  had  proved  their  weakness  and   inability  to  live  in  peace  with  each  other  and  the  environment,  eating  meat  is  not  considered  a  sin   although  God’s  original  plan  was  that  humankind  should  be  vegetarian.   The  Jewish  reasons  to  be  vegetarian   VIEWPOINT   NAOR  BAR  ZEEV   “Judaism  has  always  been  a  tradition  that  inculcates  kindness,   sensitivity  and  modesty  -  all  of  which  lead  one  to  consider   vegetarianism  as  clearly  the  more  “Jewish”  option.   FROM  a  Torah  perspective,   vegetarianism  was  originally  the  norm.  Initially  permitted  by  God  to  eat  only  vegetables,   it  was  only  after  animals  were  saved  by  Noah  that  humans  were  permitted  to  eat  meat  (Bereshit  1:28-9).   Even  then,  wanton  killing  of  ani  mals  is  prohibited  and  animals  must  be  slaughtered  swiftly  with  a  sharp   non-serrated  instrument.   Many  laws  reflect  the  principle  of  not  inflicting  needless  suffering  or  pain  on  an  animal:   •  One  must  never  eat  an  animal  while  it  is  still  alive  (Bereshit  9:4);   •  One  must  send  away  a  mother  bird  if  one  collects  eggs  (Devarim  22:7);   •  One  may  not  muzzle  an  animal  while  it  is  threshing  to  prevent  it  from  eating,  (Devarim  25:4);   •  One  may  not  even  raise  one’s  voice  to  yell  at  an  animal  if  it  eats  while  working  (Kitzur  Shulchan  Aruch  186);   •  One  should  feed  one’s  animals   prior  to  eating  one’s  own  food  (Bera  chot  40a);  and   •  One  must  care  for  a  lost  animal  until  its  owner  is  found  (Devarim  22:1-4;  Shemot  23:4).  &gt;i   Although  it  permitted  the  eating  of  meat  a  posteriori  (bedi’avad)  follow  ing  the  flood,  the  Torah  encouraged  kindness  to  animals,  clearly  viewing  them  as  sentient  beings  with  certain  rights.   The  Torah  states:  “Should  you  hap  pen  upon  a  bird’s  nest  ...  containing  chicks  or  eggs  and  the  mother  is  flut  tering  over  [them],  you  shall  not  take  her  children  in  the  presence  of  their  mother.  Rather  send  away  the  mother  and  only  then  may  you  take  her  chil  dren;  then  it  shall  be  good  for  you  and  you  shall  have  lengthy  days”.(Devarim  22:7).   Commentators  ask  whether  one  is   obligated  to  send  away  a  mother  and  take  eggs  to  fulfil  this  commandment,  or  that  it  is  only  if  one  wants  eggs  that   the  Torah  commands  it  be  done  in  this  manner.  The  Torah  Temimah  counters   the  former  approach  by  questioning  its  entire  assumption.  “For  it  is  clear  beyond  any  doubt  that  the  essence  of  this  mitzvah  is  to  avoid  cruelty  to  the   mother.   “Now  since  creatures  were  permit  ted  for  man’s  use,  and  even  their  slaughter  is  ultimately  permitted,  the  Torah  allowed  taking  the  children  in  such  a  manner  that  the  mother  does  not  see.  It  is  clear  that  the  Torah  only  provided  a  dispensation  -  but  if  one  does  not  wish  to  take  the  young,  then  clearly  he  may  leave  them.   “Not  only  that,  but  he  adds  to  the  bird  family’s  peace  of  mind  in  leaving  them  united  as  a  family.  And  no-one  can  seriously  suggest  that  one  is  obli  gated  to  separate  those  who  are  united  together!   “Similarly  the  commandment  that   one  should  not  slaughter  an  animal  and  its  offspring  on  the  same  day  should  not  be  taken  to  imply  that  one  is  obligated  to  slaughter  them  sepa  rately”  (Torah  Temimah,  Devarim  22:7).   The  Ramban  (Devarim  22:6)  adds  that  although  slaughter  is  permitted,  we  must  not  slaughter  to  the  point  of  extinction  of  a  species,  hence  the  emphasis  on  an  animal  and  its  off  spring  being  slaughtered  together.   The  Rambam  says  “animals  suffer  very  greatly  on  seeing  their  young  slaughtered,  and  there  is  no  difference  between  human  suffering  and  animal  suffering  in  these  circumstances.  For  a  mother’s  love  and  compassion  for  her  young  comes  not  from  the  ability  to  speak  and  rationalise,  but  comes  from  the  consciousness  (literally  power  of  thought)  which  is  found  in  animals  just  as  it  is  in  humans”  (Moreh  Nevuchim  3:48).  This  very  modem  sounding  approach  was  formulated  as  long  ago  as  the  12th  century  CE.   Not  only  is  one  forbidden  to  cause  suffering  to  animals  directly,  but  one  is  also  obligated  to  prevent  suffering  -  an  obligation  that  even  outweighs  possi  ble  discomfort  at  helping  Wi  enemy.  The  Talmud  extends  the  obligation  to  unload  an  animal  to  mean  that  one   may  not  place  an  unbearable  load  upon  an  animal  to  begin  with  (Bava  Metzia  32a).   Modem  farming  methods  do  place   an  unbearable  load  upon  millions  of   animals  who  live  short  lives  of  severe   suffering  for  the  sake  of  profit.   Clearly  our  sustenance  may  be  richly  enjoyed  without  causing  unnec  essary  suffering  to  others.  One  may  have  ample  energy  for  the  fulfilment  of  the  law  without  recourse  to  hurting  other  sentient  beings.   Furthermore,  those  of  the  opinion  that  other  living  creatures  benefit  by  our  eating  them  and  then  performing  mitzvot  might  remember  that  toma  toes  may  not  necessarily  be  obligated  to  keep  Shabbat  or  the  laws  of  family  purity.  Would  proponents  of  such  views  (AJN  20/2)  consider  the  option  of  cannibalising  non-observant  Jews  so  that  might  help  improve  the  overall  performance  of  mitzvot  in  the  Jewish  community?   Opinions  about  vegetarianism  abound  and  like  so  many  topics  in  Judaism,  there  is  no  single  consensus.  Judaism  has  allowed  the  eating  of  meat,  but  it  has  gone  quite  a  way  to  show  a  preference  for  the  alternatives.  Judaism  has  always  been  a  tradition   that  inculcates  kindness,  sensitivity  £  and  modesty-  all  of  which  lead  one  to*  consider  vegetarianism  as  clearly  the  more  “Jewish”  option.

Believer  versus  secular.  Modern  Orthodox  versus  Haredi.   I  have  to  admit  to  being  less  than  enthusiastic  when  I  picked  up  this  book.  Despite  strong  recommenda  tion,  I  couldn’t  believe  a  book  about  the  familiar  conflicts  of  Jewish  life  could  be  riveting  leisure  reading.   I  couldn’t  have  been  more  wrong.  Within  a  couple  of  days  I’d  powered  through  this  collection  of  extended   articles  on  the  state  of  American   Jewry  as  if  it  were  a  fast-moving  thriller  and  was  recommending  it  with  equal  fervour.   Samuel  Freedman  is  a  brilliant   journalist,  a  Pulitzer  Prize  finalist,  who  knows  exactly  how  to  turn  the  very  best  skills  of  his  profession  onto  our  community.   Each  of  the  six  chapters  in  this  book  explores  a  case  study  of  an  ide  ological  struggle,  but  it  does  so  through  the  specifics  of  personalities  and  personal  motivations  so  thor  oughly  and  vividly  painted  that  it  is  never  dry  or  difficult.   We  truly  understand  what  moti  vates  and  powers  the  individuals  on   both  sides  of  each  conflict.  Our  emo  tions  and  sense  of  identification  are  aroused  and  if  that  only  makes  the  problems  seem  more  intractable,  at  least  it  makes  them  worth  caring   about.   Each  of  the  six  cases  is  important  in  itself  but  they  act  powerfully  as  symbols  of  the  struggles  within  our  community,  no  less  so  because  this  is  clearly  America.   The  demise  of  a  secular  Zionist   youth  camp  from  the  Yiddish-speak  ing  generation  and  its  replacement  with  a  purpose-built  ultra-Orthodox  shtetl  tells  the  story  of  a  generational  change  and  perhaps  sets  the  scene  for  many  of  the  other  conflicts.   The  hopeful  but  finally  disap  pointing  Denver  experiment,  when   American  spiritual  leaders  Rabbi  Yaakov  Perlow  (left)  and  Rabbi  Levi  Horowitz  in  discussion  at  the  Agudath  Israel  of  America  conference  in  Connecticut  last   November.  Photo:  JTA   Orthodox,  Conservative  and  Reform  rabbis  worked  together  to  produce  joint  conversions,  was  a  prelude  to  the   work  of  the  Ne’eman  Commission  and  current  attempts  at  joint  conver  sion  in  Israel.   It  may  be  of  particular  interest  in  Australia  where  the  relative  closeness  of  the  different  branches  of  Judaism  has  led  to  similar  proposals.   The  Australian  community,  with  its  strong  and  rightward-drifting  Orthodox  section,  may  also  be  partic  ularly  interested  in  the  case  of  the  “Yale  Five”,  a  group  of  ultra-Orthodox  students  who  took  the  university  to  court  over  a  requirement  that  they  live  in  co-ed  dormitories,  claiming  it  breached  their  religious  freedom.   Freedman  uses  the  case  to  analyse  sharply  the  distinctions  within  the  changing  Orthodox  world.   Conflicts  over  planning  in  Con   necticut  highlight  resentments  ana   deep  fissures  between  the  Reform  and   Orthodox  communities  which  went  to  individuals’  sense  of  belonging  and  identity  as  Jews.   Conflicts  over  changing  liturgy  to  include  the  foremothers  bring  into  focus  individuals’  deepest  beliefs.   In  each  case  Freedman’s  deep  and  incisive  interviewing  has  teased  out  what  motivates  the  individuals  involved  -  their  childhoods,  their  adolescent  moments  of  discovery  and  their  personal  grief.   I  have  never  read  a  book  that   comes  anywhere  close  to  truly  explor  ing  why  we  fight  like  we  do.  If  you  care  about  the  Jewish  community  as  a  community,  read  this  book.  It’s  so  well  written,  it  will  be  a  pleasure.   Deborah  Stone  is  the  A/Ns  literary  editor.

"  World   Democrats’  strategy  to  win  back  Jewish  votes   RON  KAJV5PEAS   WASHINGTON  -  Worried  by  US  President  George  Bush’s  soaring  pop  ularity  among  Jews,  the  Democrat  Party  has  devised  a  campaign  to  win  back  Jewish  votes.   With  an  eye  on  November’s  presi  dential  election,  secret  strategy  meet  ings  were  held  18  months  ago  and  a  three-pronged  campaign  formulated:   to  stress  the  Democrat  commitment  to   Israel  and  question  Bush’s  commit  ment;  emphasise  to  Jewish  voters  they  are  likely  to  favour  Democratic  posi  tions  on  domestic  issues;  and  margin  alise  Democrats  who  alienate  Jews.   Ann  Lewis,  the  (Jewish)  communi  cations  director  for  the  Clinton  administration,  attended  meetings  of  top  Democrats  in  2002  to  discuss  the  deteriorating  situation  regarding  Jew   ish  voters.   The  trigger  was  a  May  5,  2002  “Solidarity  with  Israel”  vote  in  Con  gress  that  drew  21  negative  votes  -  18   of  them  from  Democrats.   The  congressional  vote  wasn’t  the  only  issue,  however.  Bush  was  gearing  up  for  war  with  Iraq  and  most  Demo  cratic  congressmen  and  women  were  less  than  enthusiastic  about  that.   It  became  evident  that  Jewish  Americans  saw  Saddam  Hussein’s   potential  downfall  as  a  blessing  for  Israel  and  wondered  why  the  Democ  rats  weren’t  on  board.   “We  were  aware  of  a  political  argu  ment  that  people  who  disagreed  with  the  war  on  Iraq  were  soft  on  terrorism  or  less  reliable  on  America  being  a  friend  of  Israel,”  Lewis  said.   Outreach  to  the  Jewish  communi  ty  was  seen  as  a  way  of  countering  aggressive  Republican  tactics  to  undermine  Jewish  financial  support  for  the  Democrats.   Democratic  strategists  worried  that  Jews  believed  the  party  was  tak  ing  the  community  for  granted  because  of  its  overwhelming  support  in  previous  elections.   That  notion  was  reinforced  by  exit   From  left:  Tipper  and  Al  Gore,  Joe  and  Hadassah  Ueberman  on  the  presidential   campaign  trail  in  2000  -  a  time  when  US  Jews  were  voting  Democrat  at  a  ratio  of  6  1.  The  figure  had  dropped  to  2-1  by  2002.  Photo:  aap/ap   polls  after  the  2002  mid-term  elec  tions,  which  showed  a  return  to  Rea  gan-era  numbers  when  Jews  voted  Democratic  by  a  2-1  margin,  not  the  6-1  ratio  of  the  Clinton  era.  The  Democrats  were  rattled.   Democratic  Whip  Steny  Hoyer  has  taken  the  lead  in  reaching  out  to  the  Jewish  community,  taking  15  pro  Israel  actions  since  March  2003,  such  as  leading  29  Democrats  to  Israel.   It  was  also  a  matter  not  of  refor   mulating  strategy,  but  of  reminding  Jewish  voters  where  Democrats  stand.   That  meant  allowing  little  light  between  the  Democrats  and  Israel.  One  of  Hoyer’s  first  tasks  was  to  recapture  the  Israel  solidarity  vote  in  Congress.  He  did  so  on  June  25;  it  was  passed  399-5.   Hoyer  said  the  legislators  went  to  Israel  “to  express  solidarity  with  Israel’s  cause  -  freedom  and  democ  racy  -  as  well  as  her  determination  to  survive  as  a  sanctuary  for  the  Jewish  people”.   The  primary  lesson  of  the  trip  was  that  the  security  barrier  “is  viewed  by  Democrats  as  a  reasonable  attempt  to  reduce  terrorist  attacks”.   Taking  shots  at  a  president  who   calls  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  a   “man  of  peace”  might  be  folly,  but   Democrats  believe  he  is  vulnerable.   “This  administration  is  perceived  as  very  pro-Israel,  but  that  could  change,”  said  Mark  Mellman,  a  Democratic  pollster.   He  cited  pressure  over  the  barrier  and  the  “road  map”.   Ira  Forman  of  the  National  Jewish  Democratic  Council  says  Bush  may  get  tough  with  Israel  in  a  second  term,  when  he  doesn’t  have  to  worry  about  re-election.   “The  President  and  his  party  are  head-and-shoulders  above  anyone  on  the  Democratic  side”  when  it  comes  to  Israel,  said  Matt  Brooks  of  the  Republican  Jewish  Coalition.   Some  Democrats  are  wary  of  tack  ling  Bush  on  the  Middle  East,  and  say  it’s  enough  to  tell  Jewish  voters  the   Democrats  share  his  commitment  to  Israel.   “Democrats  don’t  have  to  be  better   than  Republicans  on  Israel,  they  just  have  to  be  as  good,”  said  adviser  Steve  Rabinowitz.  “So  long  as  Democrats  are  competitive,  it  shifts  to  domestic  issues,  where  we  beat  them  hands   down.”   JTA ",2004-01-16
"  New  museum  in  Cracow   relives  Polish  Jewish  past   CAROLYN  SLUTSKY   CRACOW,  Poland  -  A  new  muse  um  in  Cracow  hopes  to  fill  a  void  in  Jewish  cultural  sites  in  this  city  and  offer  a  new  perspective  on  the  Jew  ish  past.   The  Galicia  Jewish  Museum  in  Kazimierz,  Cracow’s  Jewish  district,  opened  with  an  exhibit  by  Chris  Schwartz,  a  British  photojoumalist  who  has  worked  in  Poland  since  the  early  1980s.   Schwartz  collaborated  with  British  professor  Jonathan  Webber,  who  provides  text  for  Schwartz’s  photos,  and  a  team  of  researchers  on  the  project,  which  they  said  has  been  “10  years  in  the  making”.   Last  month  some  of  the  128  Aus  tralians  on  the  March  of  the  Living  program  visited  the  museum  dur  ing  their  week-long  stay  in  Poland.   The  exhibition  of  135  colour   photos  features  scenes  from  con  temporary  Polish  life  that  are  con  nected  with  the  Jewish  past.   These  include  streets,  farmers’  fields,  buildings,  synagogues  and  graveyards  that  once  were  the  centre  of  Jewish  life  in  Galicia  in  eastern  Poland.   One  photo  shows  faint  Yiddish  writing  next  to  a  modern  city  street  sign.  Another  depicts  a  ruined  syna  gogue,  the  roof  long  gone  and  trees  sprouting  from  the  top.  A  third  photo  shows  a  field  in  which  a  Jew  ish  cemetery  once  stood;  farmers  have  taken  care  to  plow  around  the  cemetery,  leaving  the  site   untouched.   At  the  opening  for  the  museum,  which  is  located  in  an  old  furniture   factory  that  has  been  transformed  into  a  hip,  new  art  space,  Schwartz  said  people  were  “universally  knocked  out”  by  his  exhibit.   He  also  said  it  was  Cracow’s  only  contemporary  treatment  of  its  Jew  ish  past  in  the  form  of  a  museum.  Most  relies  of  Jewish  life  in  Poland  exist  in  the  form  of  centuries-old  synagogues.   Schwartz,  whose  father  is  Jewish  but  who  considers  himself  “post  denominational”,  said  history  can  be  viewed  in  two  ways:  “We  can  either  compare  everything  to  the  prewar  glory,  or  we  can  realise  that   it’s  amazing  that  anything  survived  at  all  after  the  ferocity  of  the  Nazi   destruction.”   His  photos,  he  said,  strive  to  pre  serve  what  survives.  Schwartz  said  he  and  Webber  focused  their  research  on  Galicia  because  it  was  the  heart  of  Jewish  Poland.  “Galician  Jews  were  proud  to  be  Galician,  as  were  the  non-Jews,  and  this  was  one  of  the  most  exciting,  thriving  areas  of  Jew  ish  culture  in  the  world,”  he  said.   Przemek  Piakarski,  chairman  of  the  Jewish  studies  department  and  professor  of  Yiddish  at  Jagiellonian  University  in  Cracow,  said  he  initial  ly  had  low  expectations  for  the  museum,  but  was  pleasantly  sur  prised  and  enthused  when  he  visited.   Schwartz  said  that  the  next  step  for  the  museum  would  be  to  devel   op  educational  programs,  with  everything  from  dialogue  programs  to  debates  on  topics  such  as  “Where  was  God  during  the  Holocaust?”   I  “Galicia  was  one  of  the   most  exciting,  thriving  areas  of  Jewish  culture  in  the  world”   CHRIS  SCHWARTZ   Photographer   Gilad  Roth,  an  Israeli  musician  living  in  Cracow,  said  he  found  the  museum  realistic  and  moving.   “Most  Israelis  want  to  continue   living;  they  don’t  want  to  go  to  the  past,”  he  said.   The  Galicia  Jewish  Museum,  he  said,  gave  them  an  opportunity  to  see  beneath  the  surface  of  contem   porary  Polish  cities  and  town  to  find  the  roots  of  their  Jewish  past.   The  museum’s  sponsors  hope  the  museum  will  prompt  a  new  genera  tion  of  Poles,  Jews  and  Polish  Jews  to  learn  about  and  grapple  with  this  history.   “No-one  tries  to  understand  what  happened  through  contempo  rary  photographs.  This  generation  has  to  look  at  it  and  understand  it  for  ourselves,”  Schwartz  said.   A  book,  Traces  of  Memory,  with  400  colour  photographs  and  more  of  Webber’s  text,  and  will  be  pub   lished  next  year.   JTA ",2004-05-14
"  Jewish  life  blossoms  in  Bratislava   MENASHE  KAlTfVIANN  reports  on  his  recent  visit  to  Bratislava,  a  major  prewar  European  Jewish  community.   MANY  Australian  Jews  travel   to  explore  their  family  histo  ry  and  see  their  birthplace.  Included  among  them  in  recent  times  are  some  of  the  2000  Australian  Jews  bom  in  Slovakia,  a  former  province  of  Czechoslovakia  that  became  inde  pendent  in  1993.   The  capital  city  of  Slovakia  is  Bratislava  (also  called  Pressburg).  Before  World  War  II,  Bratislava  was  a  major  Jewish  centre  known  for  its  vibrant  community.   It  was  especially  renowned  for  its  yeshiva,  which  was  originally  established  in  the  19th  century  by  Rabbi  Moshe  Sofer,  also  known  as  the  Chatam  Sofer.   The  Chatam  Sofer’s  newly-reno  vated  burial  site  on  the  bank  of  the  Danube  River  attracts  many  visitors  to  Bratislava.   Even  the  Slovakian  authorities  have  renamed  the  tram  stop  on  the  road  outside  these  graves  as  the  “Chatam  Sofer”  stop.   What  also  attracts  many  visitors  to  the  city  is  the  household  of  Rabbi  Baruch  Myers  and  his  wife  Chanie.  Rabbi  Myers  is  currently  the  only   rabbi  in  Slovakia.   The  Myers  household  is  an  open  house  -  visitors  from  the  local  com  munity  and  abroad  often  pop  in  unannounced.  Recent  guests  who  enjoyed  their  hospitality  include  trav  ellers  from  Slovakia,  Australia,  the  USA,  Canada  and  Israel.   Chanie  Myers  said:  “Our  doors  are  always  open.  We  have  often  been   referred  to  as  the  Kosher  Hotel  of  Bratislava.”   Rabbi  Myers  serves  as  the  local  shochet,  ba’al  koreh  (Torah  reader),  chazan  and  general  Jewish  communi  ty  representative.   Both  Rabbi  Myers  and  his  wife  speak  fluent  Slovakian  and  he  fre  quently  appears  on  Slovakian  TV  to   The  Interior  of  the  newly  renovated  gravesite  of  the  Chatam  Sofer.

In  1995  the  Myers  founded  the  Jewish  Educational  Centre  which  includes  a  kindergarten,  summer  camp,  Hebrew  school  and  adult-edu   cation  classes.   Chanie  Meyers  is  the  centre’s  director  of  programming,  planning  programs  for  many  community  holi  day  events.   “Three  generations  of  Slovakian  Jews  are  educated  simultaneously  at  the  centre  -  a  new  generation  is  being  raised  with  pride  in  their  heritage,  associating  Judaism  with  excitement,  fun  and  real  depth,”  she  said.   “The  older  generation  survived  the  Holocaust,  their  children  grew  up  under  communism  and  their  grand  children  finally  have  a  chance  for  Jew   ish  education.”   Chanie  Myers  points  out  that  women’s  gatherings  are  very  popular,  often  attracting  50  to  80  women  from  all  over  Slovakia.  Some  travel  by  overnight  train  to  attend.   Once  thriving  but  now  smaller  Slo  vakian  Jewish  communities  like  Duna  jska  Streda  (also  known  as  Serdahely),  Nitra,  Nove  Zamsky  and  Galanta  lack  their  own  rabbi  but  now  look  to  Rabbi  Myers  for  guidance  and  assistance.   One  day  the  elderly  shamash  Karshi  Grossman  regaled  us  with  stories  of  his  childhood  in  Filakova,  Slovakia.  He  said  he  has  cousins  in  Australia  includ  ing  “Ference  Lowy”.

"  Byron’s  no  beach  for   two  Jewish  councillors   ORYANA  KAUFMAN   IN  what  appears  to  be  indicative  of  a  growing  demographic  shift  to  the  beaches  of  Byron  Bay,  two  out  of  the   nine  councillors  elected  in  last  month’s  local  elections  are  Jewish.   But  both  councillors  -  John  Lazarus,  49,  and  Peter  Westheimer,  52  -  told  the  AJN  this  week  that  despite  being  Jewish,  they  will  not  specifically  represent  Jews  or  Israel  amid  growing  claims  of  perceived  antisemitic  and   anti-Israel  bias  in  the  local  media.   Co-chair  of  the  local  communal   organisation,  the  Rainbow  Kehilah,  Julie  Nathan  said  she  understood  their  rationale:  “When  Jews  identify  them  selves  as  Jews  and  stand  up  for  Israel  and  antisemitism  they  might  make   enemies.   “I  have  already  heard  some  street  talk  that  there  are  too  many  Jews  in  council.  If  they  do  a  good  job  then  they  are  the  good  guys,  but  if  not  they  will  be  known  as  bad  Jews,”  said  Nathan,  who  is  also  a  member  of  a  group  which  aims  to  combat  anti   semitism  in  the  area.   Jews  are  believed  to  comprise  around  1000  of  the  estimated  29,000  people  living  in  Byron  Bay  and  the  sur  rounding  townships.  About  300  of  those  are  Israelis  living  permanendy  in  Australia.  There  is  also  a  substantial  number  of  transitory  Jewish  tourists.   Councillor  Lazarus,  one  of  three  Greens  candidates  elected,  said  he  doesn’t  view  die  local  media  as  antise  mitic,  but  conceded  there  “may  be  a  lack  of  sensitivity  for  the  people  who  lived  through  the  Holocaust”.   “Perhaps  there  has  not  been  enough   comment  on  the  Israelis  who  are  work   ing  for  peace.  It  gets  clouded  out  by  the  policies  of  the  Israeli  Government.  I  do  have  concerns  with  social  justice  reflected  in  Israel’s  policy  in  place  at  the  moment,”  said  Lazarus,  whose  main  platform  is  the  environment.   Councillor  Westheimer,  a  former  member  of  the  Greens  who  is  now  an   independent,  said  his  main  platform  is  “to  protect  the  environment  and  make  sure  the  Byron  Shire  stays  a  buffer  zone  to  rampant  development  that  is  happening”.   “Israel  is  in  a  terrible  position  at  the  moment...  which  results  in  a  divided   country  and  many  disillusioned  Israelis,  many  of  whom  are  coming  to  Australia,”  he  said.   Dawn  Cohen,  a  writer  and  member  of  the  Rainbow  Kehilah  who  recently  moved  from  Sydney  to  the  Byron  Shire,  told  the  AJN  that  political  repre  sentation  was  not  enough.  “We  need  lews  in  every  walk  of  life,  and  particu  larly  Jews  in  left-wing  and  progressive  organisations  to  come  out  in  public  as  Jews,  and  to  develop  a  greater  con   sciousness  of  the  subtle  antisemitism   in  everyday  Australian  life,”  she  said.   “The  left-wing  Byron  community  can’t  tell  the  difference  between  appro  priate  criticism  of  the  Israeli  Govern  ment  and  inappropriate  antisemitic  critique,”  Cohen  said  in  reference  to  recent  perceived  anti-Israel  bias  in  the   local  media.   These  elections  don’t  mark  the  first  Jewish  councillors  in  Byron  Shire:  San  dra  Heilpem  was  elected  in  the  2002  by-election. ",2004-04-23
"  Chanukah,  Christmas  and  some  Jewish  soul-searching   VIEWPOINT   PETER  KOHN   The  Aussie  Christmas  is   pervasive  and  magnetic.  There  are  no  pogroms   and  the  welcome  mat  is  out   A  HANDFUL  of  Australia’s   TV  current-affairs  broad  casters  and  radio  commen   tators  are  up  in  arms.  They  have  invoked  the  Grinch,  of  misan  thropic  repute,  and  Dickens’  Scrooge,  as  they  rail  against  their  favourite  nemesis,  political  correctness.  They   are  concerned  that  PC’s  latest  victim  is  Christmas.   A  heated  ideological  row  has  bro  ken  out  over  allegations  that  Sydney  City  Council  has  toned  down  this  year’s  bunting  and  that  a  burger  chain  banned  a  nativity  scene  (it  has  since  relented).   Even  the  prime  minister  entered  the  fray,  lamenting  the  “blanding”  of  Australian  society  and  the  decline  of  overtly  Christian  displays  in  depart  ment  stores  at  this  time  of  the  year.   It  appears  Christmas  has  become  the  latest  -  and  most  unlikely  -  hostage  of  the  cultural  crossfire  that  has  been  plaguing  a  host  of  issues,  such  as  Aboriginal  affairs,  detention  of  asylum-seekers,  abortion  and  stem-cell  research  in  recent  years.   Does  the  presence  of  large  num   bers  of  non-Christians  in  Australia   make  it  appropriate  to  tone  down  the  more  religious  references  in  public  displays  of  Christmas?  Some  Aus  tralians  certainly  think  so,  others  are  passionately  opposed.   Has  the  arrival  of  Family  First  in  the  Senate  -  and  the  shaping  of  what   some  media  commentators  have   called  the  “voting  churchgoer  con  stituency'’  -  made  an  impact?  Do  Jews  care?  Should  they?   Leaving  the  nativity-scene  debate  to  one  side,  there  is  an  underlying  question.  Should  Jews  be  concerned  at  recent  attempts  to  revive  the  reli  giosity  of  Christmas,  a  trend  that  for  historical  reasons  strikes  dark  chords   in  the  Jewish  collective  memory?   Or  should  they  be  more  con  cerned  at  its  present  state  of  commer  cialisation,  expressed  in  the  siren’s   song  of  television,  tinsel  and  depart   ment-store  music?  It  seems  a  com  mercial,  national  Christmas  is  still  the  bigger  threat  to  Jewish  identity.   Executive  Council  of  Australian   Jewry  deputy  president  Rabbi  John  Levi  makes  the  observation  that  Christmas  has  become  more  com  mercialised  than  ever.   Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victoria  president  Michael  Lipshutz  adds:  “Christmas  has  become  Thanks   giving,”  referring  to  the  American  hol  iday  that  has  cast  off  any  Christian  origins  it  ever  had  and  has  become  a  purely  civic  exclamation  point   Contemporary  Christmas  in  the  English-speaking  world,  particularly  the  end-of-year  meltdown  in  sum  mertime  Australia,  is  a  far  cry  from  19th-century  Christmases  in  the  darker  parts  of  Europe  or  czarist  Russia  that  echoed  with  the  hoofbeats  of  Cossacks  screaming  the  libel  of   “Christ-killers”  at  us.   The  Aussie  Christmas  is  pervasive  and  magnetic.  There  are  no  pogroms   and  the  welcome  mat  is  out   Australian  media  commentators   still  make  the  incredible  assumption  that  everyone  celebrates  Christmas;  that  it  is  the  pot  of  gold  at  the  end  of   the  multicultural  rainbow.   As  the  practising  Catholic  who  cuts  my  lawn  and  regularly  discusses  Judaism  with  me,  asked:  “Surely  you  celebrate  Christmas  in  some  way?”  I  felt  terrible  that  I  had  to  disappoint  him,  and  then  I  began  wondering  why  it  made  me  feel  so  bad.   Temple  Beth  Israel’s  senior  minis  ter  Rabbi  Fred  Morgan  noted  during  his  workshop  on  “Jews  in  the  world”  at  a  recent  Union  for  Progressive  Judaism  conference  that  as  a  people,  we  have  a  tendency  to  practise  hukkat  ha  goy  (imitation  of  the  mainstream  culture).  Jews  in  free  societies  have  striven,  in  a  flourish  of  civic  gratitude,  to  be  better  goyim  than  the  goyim.   How  else  can  you  explain  that  America’s  biggest-selling  Christmas  recording  of  all  time  was  White  Christmas  by  Irving  Berlin,  a  Jewish  immigrant  of  the  early  20th  century?  Or  that  for  decades,  a  legion  of  Holly   wood  Jewish  entertainers  have,  with  out  qualms,  sung  Silent  Night  and   other  Christmas  tributes  to  their  dot  ing  audiences?   Back  here  in  Australia,  it  is  not  what  your  European-bred  bobba  and  zaida  would  approve  of,  because  they  know,  with  two  millennia  of  grave  European  logic,  that  the  wrapping  and  the  bow  cannot  change  what’s  inside   the  box-  that  Christmas  is  one  of  the   two  biggest  holidays  of  Christianity.   They  know  in  their  kishkes  that  it’s  just  not  our  holiday.  But  their  grand  children,  even  some  of  those  who  enjoy  the  benefit  of  a  Jewish  dayschool  education,  might  not  have  that  gut  feeling  to  guide  them.  So  it  seems  making  a  bigger  deal  of  Chanukah  has  become  the  antidote.   The  drive  to  give  Chanukah  a  higher  profile  has  a  fascinating  range   of  motives.  As  Rabbinical  Council  of   Victoria  president  Rabbi  Gidon  Fox  notes,  there  is  a  halachic  imperative  to  publicise  to  the  world  the  nes,  the  miracle  of  the  unquenchable  flame  of   freedom.   But  more  likely,  it  is  the  obvious  proximity  of  Chanukah  to  Christmas  that  makes  it  an  opportunity  to  con  vert  the  relatively  obscure  tradition  of  giving  Chanukah  gelt  (money)  into  a  gift  bonanza.   Chanukah  is  a  cliag,  not  a  yom  tov.   Rabbi  Levi  notes  that  Chanukah  is   essentially  a  festival  observed  in  the  home,  which  has  been  subjected  to  all  sorts  of  attempts  to  turn  it  into  a  Christmas-style  civic  fiesta.   Yet  the  most  obvious  reason  for   wanting  to  stage  Chanukah  in  the  city  and  not  just  around  the  dining  room  table  is  that,  if  a  multicultural  society  means  anything  at  all,  Jews  should  not  have  to  choose  between  blending  in  or  feeling  like  intergalactic  visitors  for  the  last  eight  weeks  of  the  year.

"  The  right  to  be   THREE  nasty  incidents  have  occurred  in  recent  days  -  unrelated  to   each  other,  yet  each  one  an  unpleasant  reminder  of  the  deep  seated  anti-Jewish  prejudice  which  has  been  surfacing  with  dis  turbing  frequency  in  recent  months:   •  Four  members  of  the  community  —  three  of  them  brothers  who  immigrated  from  South  Africa  a  few  months  ago  -  were  assaulted  in  Vau   cluse  on  New  Year’s  Eve.   •  A  university  student  who  was  seeking  to  purchase  a  book  on  the  Holo  caust  from  the  Co-Op  Bookstore  on  Broadway  was  verbally  abused  by  the  sales  assistant.  He  told  her  he  was  “sick  of  Jews  and  their  complaining  r  about  what  happened  to  them  in  World  War  II”;  “more  Gypsies  died  dur   ing  World  War  II  but  if  anyone  mentions  this  truth,  Jews  scream  anti  semitism”;  “Jews  are  perpetrating  genocide  against  the  Palestinians”  but  no-one  can  do  anything  about  it  because  the  “Jews  control  the  world”;  and  “I  have  friends  who  hate  Israel”.  He  then  refused  to  sell  her  the  book.   •  Antisemitic  graffiti  were  burnt  into  the  lawns  outside  Tasmania’s   Parliament  House.   Last  year  saw  540  antisemitic  incidents  perpetrated  in  Australia  -  the  second-highest  figure  since  official  records  began  to  be  kept  15  years  ago.   The  number  of  incidents  entailing  physical  assault,  property  damage  and  face-to-face  harassment  was  the  highest  ever  recorded.  These  includ  ed  arson  attacks  on  synagogues,  assaulting  a  rabbi  and  throwing  rocks  at   kosher  outlets.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  described  the  statistics  recently  as  “the  tip  of  the  iceberg”  as  many  incidents  are  not  reported  and  some  of  those  which  are  logged  are  not  included  in  the  data  if  they  cannot  be  determined  to  have  been  antisemitic.   More  than  half  of  the  perpetrators  could  not  be  identified,  while  about  threequarters  of  the  rest  were  from  the  far  right,  16  per  cent  from  the  far  left  and  10  per  cent  from  Arab  or  Muslim  sources,  it  was  reported  at  the  ECAJ  conference  last  month.   It  should  be  absurd  to  make  such  a  point,  but  as  full  and  equal  citizens   of  Australia,  Jews  have  every  right  to  be  out  in  the  open  as  proudly  identifying  members  of  the  Jewish  community,  wearing  a  kippa  if  they  so  wish,  walking  to  or  from  synagogue  if  they  so  wish,  without  fear  of  being  abused,  harassed,  intimidated  or  assaulted.   i  They  have  every  right  to  be  protected  from  such  thuggery  as  happened  to   the  four  members  of  the  community  on  New  Year’s  Eve  and  from  such  abuse  as  happened  to  the  university  student  at  the  Co-Op  Bookstore  last  week.   Obviously,  it  is  impossible  to  prevent  every  such  incident  and  unfeasible  to  police  every  street  corner;  but  there  most  certainly  is  a  case  for  an  increased  police  presence  in  the  areas  where  such  occurrences  happen  most  frequently  and  for  more  rigorous  efforts  to  apprehend  the  perpetrators  when  incidents  do  occur.   Australian  Jewry  is  far  better  off  than  many  communities  around  the  world  in  this  respect,  but  such  a  comparison  pales  into  meaninglessness  when  an  individual  or  an  institution  becomes  a  target  and  a  victim,   i  The  message  which  needs  to  be  conveyed  is  that  such  activity  has  no   place  in  our  society,  that  an  attack  on  Jews  constitutes  an  affront  to  the  Australian  way  of  life.   It  is  incumbent  on  our  political  leaders  -  premiers,  ministers,  shadow  ministers,  MPs  -  to  make  that  statement,  to  speak  out  and  to  condemn  those  responsible  for  such  incidents  forcefully  and  unequivocally.   Furthermore,  it  is  up  to  them  to  ensure  that  the  arm  of  the  law  is  wielded  so  forcefully  that  intending  perpetrators  know  that  they  will  pay  a  price  for  such  behaviour.

"  I   Israeli,  Jewish  athletes  at  the  Athens  Olympics   ISRAEL’S  athletes  carry  out  a  poignant  tradition  on  the  eve  of  the   Olympic  Games.  It  is  a  powerfully  symbolic  gesture  which  flies  in  the  face  of  the  raison  d'etre  of  the  games  -  bringing  together  the  world’s  finest  ath  letes  in  a  spirit  of  camaraderie  and  sportsmanship.   Before  departing  the  country,  Israel’s  Olympians  visit  the  families  of  the  11  Israeli  athletes  and  officials  who  were  murdered  at  the  1972  games  in  Munich.   At  a  primary  level,  it  is  a  mark  of  respect,  honouring  their  compatriots  and  fellow-athletes  who  were  brutally  killed  by  Palestinian  terrorists.   Yet  it  is  much  more  than  that.  It  serves  as  a  painful  reminder  that,  56  years  after  its  establishment,  Israel  is  still  struggling  to  earn  its  rightful  and  equal  place  as  a  nation  and  to  be  accorded  the  automatic  and  unquestioning  acceptance  that  is  granted  the  other  192  nations  of  the  world  -  even  those  which  are  run  by  despots  and  tyrants,  even  those  which  have  never  experienced  the  freedoms  of  democracy  or  the  benefits  of  a  ballot  box.   It  is  a  reminder  that  the  fear  of  terrorism  has  become  the  overriding  issue  which  attends  every  international  gathering  of  consequence.   And  it  is  a  reminder  of  why  -  while  the  Olympic  athletes’  quarters  in  Athens  will  be  protected  by  a  double  fence,  concrete  barriers,  cameras  and  sensors,  augmented  by  military  and  police  patrols  -  the  Israeli  team  will,  of  necessity,  be  housed  in  its  own  separate  area  with  its  own  security  fence  and  various  other  measures  in  place.   AS  author  Paul  Taylor  points  out  in  his  newly-published  book  Jews  and   the  Olympic  Games:  The  Clash  between  Sport  and  Politics,  the  participa  tion  of  Jews  in  the  Olympics  has  been  overshadowed  by  politics  before.  Jewish  athletes  agonised  over  whether  or  nor  to  compete  at  the  1936  Berlin  games,  with  many  withdrawing,  rather  than  be  seen  to  support  the  emergent  Nazi  regime.   But  many  did  compete,  and  the  games  were  the  scene  of  a  bizarre  incident  when  American  Jewish  athletes  Marty  Glickman  and  Sam  Stoller  were  pulled  from  the  US  400-metre  relay  team  at  the  last  minute  so  as  not  to  offend  Hitler,   who  was  in  the  stands.   The  irony  of  that  appalling  capitulation  was  that  they  were  replaced  by  two  black  runners  -  Ralph  Metcalfe  and  Jesse  Owens,  giving  the  latter  his  fourth  gold  medal.  For  the  record,  Owens  protested  at  his  Jewish  team-mates’  exclusion,  but  was  ordered  to  “shut  up  and  do  as  you’re  told”.   Jewish  athletes  have  distinguished  themselves  at  the  Olympics,  dating  back  to  the  first  modem  Olympics  in  Athens  in  1896,  where  three  Jews  won  gold  medals,  with  about  250  Jewish  athletes  winning  400  Olympic  medals  in  all,  over  100  of  them  gold.   But  no  athlete  has  bettered  the  remarkable  performance  by  American  swimmer  Mark  Spitz,  the  only  individual  ever  to  win  seven  gold  medals  at  one  Olympics  -  which  he  did  in  Munich,  completing  his  events  just  before  the  Israeli  athletes  were  murdered,  after  which  he  was  removed  from  the  Olympic  Village  for  safety.   While  nowhere  at  the  same  level,  American  Lenny  Krayzelburg  -  a  former  Russian  immigrant  to  California  -  has  won  three  gold  medals  in  backstroke,  breaking  world  records  in  the  process.   Israel,  which  won  its  first  Olympic  medal  at  the  1992  Barcelona  games  -  Yael  Arad’s  silver  for  judo  -  has  medal  prospects  this  year  in  the  shape  of  kayaker  Michael  Kalganov,  who  won  a  bronze  in  Sydney;  wrestler  Gocha  Tsitsiashvili,  who  has  won  a  world  championship;  and  pole-vaulter  Alex  Averbuch,  who  has  won  a  European  championship.   Australia’s  team  includes  four  Jewish  athletes  —  judo  exponent  Sonya  Chervonsky,  baseballer  Gavin  Fingleson,  soccer  player  Tal  Karp  and  table  tennis  player  David  Zalcberg.   We  wish  them,  the  entire  Australian  team  and  the  Israeli  team  a  successful  games,  conducted  in  a  spirit  of  camaraderie  and  sportsmanship,  and  in  safety. ",2004-08-13

The  exhibition  will  focus  on  events  which  took  place  in  the  northern  Ukrainian  village  of  Semiki  in  Sep  tember  1942  when  850  Jews,  including  women  and  children,  were  murdered  by  the  Nazis  and  their  collaborators.

The  excavation,  which  uncovered  skeletal  remains,  bullet  casings  and   personal  effects  belonging  to  the  vic  tims,  was  prompted  by  a  1989  Aus  tralian  Special  Investigations  Unit  (SIU)  investigation  into  a  Ukrainian  born  Adelaide  man  suspected  of  tak  ing  part  in  the  massacre.   Following  the  closure  of  the  SIU  in  1992,  the  evidence  was  placed  in  the  care  of  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum.   The  $15  million  SIU  was  estab  lished  by  the  Hawke  Government  in  1987  to  prosecute  suspected  war  crim  inals  living  in  Australia.

"  Pork  on  the  table  undermines  Jewish  history   VIEWPOINT   MICHAEL  FREUND   Pork  has  no  place  in   Israel's  supermarkets  or  on  its  shelves,  nor  on   the  High  Court’s  agenda.  This  is,  after  all,  a  Jewish  country,  and  that  is  what  it  must  remain.   IT  was  a  decision  as  predictable  as   it  was  disheartening.  Last  week’s  ruling  by  the  High  Court  to  allow  the  sale  of  pork  in  Israel  is  nothing   less  than  a  slap  in  the  face  to  Jewish  history,  tradition  and  culture.   It  marks  another  milestone  in  the   campaign  by  sectors  of  society  to  de  Judaise  the  state  and  strip  away  any  remaining  vestiges  of  our  heritage.   Only  a  jurist  with  the  most  tenu  ous  of  attachments  to  our  past  could  countenance  such  a  decree.  There  is   something  distasteful,  even  distress  ing,  about  nine  Jewish  judges  sitting  in  Jerusalem,  capital  of  the  Jewish  peo  ple,  issuing  such  a  ruling.   At  first  glance  the  decision  might  appear  reasonable.  After  all,  from  a  ffee-market  perspective,  why  should  the  state  interfere  in  the  marketplace?   Proponents  will  argue  that  those  opposed  to  the  sale  of  pork  can  use  all  the  tools  available  to  persuade  con  sumers  of  pig  flesh  to  change  their  ways.  Yet  deep  down,  we  know  that  while  this  approach  may  suit  your  average  western  democracy,  it  doesn’t   cut  it  when  it  comes  to  Israel.   This  is  supposed  to  be  a  Jewish  state.  If  we  eliminate  all  our  unique  national  customs  and  beliefs,  we  run  the  risk  of  diluting  our  collective  sense  of  identity  as  a  people.   Every  society  has  its  norms,  and  the  Jewish  people  are  no  different.  Strictly  speaking,  there  is  no  difference  as  far  as  Jewish  law  is  concerned  between  eating  a  ham  sandwich,  din  ing  on  steamed  lobster  or  downing  a  plate  of  shrimp;  all  are  prohibited.   But  refraining  from  pork  has  become  a  symbol,  not  just  of  fidelity  to  Jewish  law,  but  of  maintaining  an  attachment  with  the  Jewish  people.   Over  2000  years  ago,  when  Syrian  Greek  emperor  Antiochus  Epiphanes  ruled  over  Israel,  it  was  decreed  that   A  sign  recomendlng  the  best  meat  of  the  day  in  a  dell  selling  pork  products  in   Jerusalem.  Photo:  AAP/AP   eating  pig  would  serve  as  a  test  of  the  Jews’  loyalty.   There  were  Jews  who  chose  death,  rather  than  be  forced  to  eat  “the  food  which  it  is  unlawful  to  taste,  even  for  love  of  life”   In  the  Inquisition,  Spanish  inquisi  torial  courts  found  people  guilty  of  being  “secret  Jews”  on  the  grounds  that  they  refused  to  eat  pork.  Declin  ing  to  eat  pig  was  considered  sufficient  reason  to  condemn  a  person  to  be   burnt  at  the  stake.   By  overturning  regulations  in  three  Israeli  municipalities  against  the  sale   of  pork,  the  High  Court  is  essentially  assaulting  one  of  the  most  emotive  symbols  of  Jewish  faith.   Don’t  be  fooled  by  assertions  that  this  is  about  individual  rights.  That  is  a  cover  for  what  is  at  work  here  -   nothing  less  than  an  all-out  assault  on  the  Jewish  character  of  the  state.   A  concerted  effort  has  been  made   in  recent  years  to  tear  away  the  Jewish  symbols  of  Israel’s  public  life.   Whether  it  is  proposals  to  change  the  national  anthem  or  to  abolish  the  Chief  Rabbinate,  the  goal  is  the  same:  to  transform  Israel  into  “just  another   country”,  cut  off  from  its  distinctive  past,  oblivious  to  its  eternal  heritage.   The  court’s  pig-headed  ruling  will  help  bring  this  goal  one  step  closer.   The  court  sees  little  problem  with   the  fact  that  restrictions  are  common   ly  imposed  on  the  sale  of  various  products,  from  firearms  to  alcohol  to  prescription  drugs  to  certain  pets.   But  when  it  comes  to  outlawing  pig  and  showing  respect  for  Jewish  tradi  tion,  the  judges  suddenly  insist  on  invoking  the  principle  of  individual  autonomy.  How  convenient.   Ironically,  on  the  same  day  that  Israel’s  High  Court  was  declaring  war  on  the  Divine,  the  US  Supreme  Court  was  reaffirming  respect  for  it.   Eight  US  judges  overturned  a  court’s  decision,  thereby  preserving  the  phrase  “One  nation,  under  God”  in  the  pledge  of  allegiance.   The  case  involved  a  California  atheist  who  had  sued  the  government,  seeking  to  ban  the  recitation  of  the  pledge  in  his  daughter’s  school   because  it  made  reference  to  God.   While  the  US  Supreme  Court’s  decision  was  based  on  a  technicality  and  did  not  address  the  constitutional  issues  at  stake,  the  result  nonetheless  was  the  same:  America  decided  not  to  turn  its  back  on  its  religious  and  cul  tural  heritage,  which  it  proudly  and  unabashedly  embraces.   If  only  our  judges  in  Jerusalem  would  learn  from  their  example  and  not  be  ashamed  to  assert  Jewish  pride.   Pork  has  no  place  in  Israel’s  super  markets  or  on  its  shelves,  nor  on  the  court’s  agenda.  This  is  a  Jewish  coun  try,  and  that  is  what  it  must  remain.

"  Paradise  found  as  Jewish   education  reaches  Byron  Bay   MELISSA  SINGER   JEWISH  education  has  arrived  in  par  adise  following  the  expansion  of  Acad  emy  BJE  on  the  NSW  north  coast.   Earlier  this  year,  Academy  BJE  launched  classes  at  Ocean  Shores  Pri  mary  School—located  20  minutes  out  side  of  Byron  Bay  -  and  at  Mullumbimby  High  School.   Israeli-born  teacher  Nirit  Feinstein  arrived  with  her  husband  and  five  chil   dren  from  Sydney  less  than  one  year  ago  and  currently  teaches  five  children  -  including  three  of  her  own  -  at  Ocean  Shores  and  three  at  Mul  lumbimby  High  School.  Eleven  chil  dren  are  enrolled  for  2005.   “There’s  a  lot  of  interest...  people  come  up  to  me  and  say  it’s  a  wonder  ful  thing  ...  but  it  has  to  be  pushed,  parents  have  to  show  more  enthusi  asm.  It’s  a  work  in  progress,”  Feinstein  told  the  AJN.   Academy  BJE  principal  Lilly  Maltz  hopes  the  expansion  will  cater  to  the  “hundreds  of  young  Jewish,  often  Israeli  families,  who  live  there”.   “There’s  a  burgeoning  population  there  and  we  are  happy  to  start  supply  ing  education  in  that  area,”  she  said.   Ami  Tabakhoff,  whose  daughter   Kahlia  learns  under  Feinstein  at  Mul   lumbimby,  said  previously  her  only  Jewish  education  was  “what  I  taught   her  at  home”.   “I  try  to  push  her  [Kahlia]  as  much  as  possible,”  she  said.  “A  lot  of  Jews  here  seem  to  want  to  let  go  of  all  that  [Judaism]  unfortunately.  But  I  think  it  is  [Academy  BJE]  great.”   Currently,  there  are  an  estimated  500  families  in  the  Byron  Shire,  many  of  them  Israelis  who  are  not  served  by   the  existing  Jewish  community  organ   isation,  the  Rainbow  Kehillah.   Gold  Coast-based  Chabad  Rabbi  Moshe  Serebryanski  stressed  the  importance  of  Jewish  initiatives  in  the  area,  such  as  Academy  BJE,  which  respect  “local  sensitivities”.   “Anything  you  force  in  front  of  peoples  faces  will  have  a  negative  backlash,”  said  Rabbi  Serebryanski.   “[The  Academy]  BJE  format  allows  contact  with  Judaism  without  being  overbearing.”   Academy  BJE  reaches  approxi  mately  2000  children  in  71  schools  across  New  South  Wales.  Its  website,  where  students  from  non-BJE  schools  can  access  lessons  and  resources,  receives  more  than  6000  hits  per  day.   Feinstein  also  provides  Jewish  edu  cation  at  Commonwealth-funded  childcare  centres  in  the  area.   Byron  Shire  support  services  co  ordinator  Jane  Woodruff  says  the  ini  tiative  “forms  a  bridge  between  children  and  childcare  staff  ...  and  helps  break  down  [cultural]  barriers”.   However,  she  says  the  arrival  of  Chabad  in  the  area  in  no  way  threatens   the  Rainbow  Kehillah.   “We  operate  on  two  different  plat  forms.  They  are  ...  pluralistic.  Chabad  is  straight  down  the  line  Orthodox.   “The  growth  of  a  Jewish  comm  unity  is  [evidenced]  by  a  variety  of  avenues  for  people  to  express  their  Judaism  -  and  that’s  a  good  thing.”   Rainbow  Kehillah  spokesperson  Julie  Nathan  said  the  arrival  of  Chabad  and  Academy  BJE  “adds  variety  and   choice”  in  the  area.   “The  more  kids  have  a  Jewish  edu  cation  up  here,  the  better.  [Academy]  BJE  has  a  great  future  up  here.”   The  beaches  of  Byron  Bay  ...Academy  BJE  has  started  Jewish  education  classes  in   the  shire.

"  Help  keep  the  memory  of  Ireland  s  Jewish  community  alive   I  AM  writing  to  inform  readers  that  an  important  part  of  Jewish  history  is  in  jeopardy  of  being  forgotten.   Ironically,  I  was  made  aware  of  this  by  an  Irish  Catholic  friend.   The  colourful  history  of  Ireland’s  Jewish  community  has  not  received   much  attention  in  recent  decades.   My  friend  told  me  about  the  Irish  Jewish  Museum  in  Dublin;  whenever  a  Jewish  friend  dies,  he  makes  a  memo  rial  donation  to  it  in  that  persons  name,  and  the  museum  notifies  the  family  of  the  deceased  about  the  dona   tion.   I  will  follow  the  lead  of  two  Jewish  friends  and  make  donations  to  the  Irish  Jewish  Museum  in  the  name  of  a   deceased  Irish  Catholic  friend  when  the  occasion  should  arise;  in  the  past,  I  have  not  known  the  right  place  to  which  to  make  a  donation  in  the  memory  of  an  Irish  Catholic  friend.   The  period  of  1881  to  1910  repre  sented  the  high  period  of  Jewish  immigration  to  Ireland,  the  majority  of  immigrants  hailing  from  Lithuania.   The  role  of  Irish  Jews  in  the  strug  gle  for  Irish  independence  from   Britain  was  extensive.   In  the  1940s  Ireland’s  Jewish  com  munity  numbered  over  6000.  In  the  20th  century  Irelands  three  largest  cities  -  Dublin,  Belfast  and  Cork  -  each  elected  a  lord  mayor  of  Jewish  faith,  the  most  prominent  of  which  was   Dublin’s  Robert  Briscoe.   For  decades,  Dublin  had  its  “Little  Jerusalem”  while  Cork  had  its  “Jew  town”.  Furthermore,  until  the  1950s,  Dublin’s  Jewish  community  was  so  vibrant  that  it  supported  eight  kosher  butcheries  and  12  synagogues.   The  island’s  Jewish  population  has  dwindled  as  young  Irish  Jews  have  left   for  the  US  and  Britain.   A  1991  estimate  said  there  were  1600  Jews  in  the  Republic  of  Ireland  and  410  in  Northern  Ireland.  About  350  Irish-born  Jews  live  in  Israel.   The  most  famous  Irish  Jew  to  immigrate  to  Israel  was  Chaim  Her  zog,  elected  President  of  Israel  in  1983.   Herzog  was  bom  in  Belfast  in  1918   and  raised  in  Dublin,  speaking  Eng  lish,  Gaelic,  Hebrew  and  Yiddish.  His  father  was  Chief  Rabbi  of  Ireland  and  later  Chief  Rabbi  of  Israel.   The  fascinating  subject  of  Ireland’s  Jewish  heritage  is  explored  in  two  great  books,  The  Jews  of  Ireland  by  Louis  Hyman  and  Jews  in  Twentieth  Centu  ry  Ireland  by  Dermot  Keogh   A  great  article  by  Ray  Rivlin,  “Shalom  Ireland:  A  Social  History  of  the  Jews  in  Modem  Ireland”,  can  be  found  on  the  internet;  and  an  inform  ative  website  is  www.jewishlreland.com   I  want  to  share  with  your  readers  the  idea  of  helping  preserve  Ireland’s  Jewish  heritage  by  making  a  memorial   donation  in  the  name  of  a  deceased  Irish  Catholic  friend  to  the  Irish  Jewish  Museum.  The  address  is:  Irish  Jewish  Museum,  3/4  Walworth  Road,  South  Circular  Road,  Dublin  8,  Ireland.   The  museum  is  housed  in  a  former   synagogue  and  run  by  members  of  Dublin’s  Jewish  community.   Be  sure  to  include  the  name  and   address  of  the  family  of  the  deceased  so  that  the  museum  can  acknowledge  the  donation.  The  family  of  the  Irish  deceased  will  be  touched  by  such  an  expression  of  sympathy.  Please  help  keep  the  memory  of  Ireland’s  Jewish  community  alive.

"  Democrat  candidate  John  Kerry:  Meet  my  Jewish  family   SHARON  LUCKERMAN   DETROIT  -  When  Cameron  Kerry  fell  in  love  with  Kathy  Weinman,  he  decided  to  convert  from  Catholicism  to  Judaism.   Little  did  he  know  that  he  already  had  a  strong  Jewish  connection  -  his  father’s  parents  were  Jewish.   This  was  uncovered  when  the  Boston  Globe  hired  a  genealogist  to  check  into  the  roots  of  his  brother,   John  F  Kerry,  the  Democratic  Party’s  presidential  frontrunner,  believed  by  many  to  be  of  Irish  background.   The  Kerry  family  was  traced  to  a  town  in  the  Austrian  empire,  now  part  of  the  Czech  Republic.  Before  migrat  ing  to  America,  the  Kerrys  changed  their  name  from  Kohn  and  converted  from  Judaism  to  Catholicism.   “It  was  mind-blowing,”  said  Cameron  Kerry  -  as  was  the  number  of  Jews  in  his  shul  with  similar  stories.  “It’s  an  American  story,”  he  said.   It  will  be  an  even  more  powerful  Jewish  story  if  John  Kerry  wins  the   Democratic  presidential  frontrunner   John  F  Kerry.  Photo:  jta   White  House  on  November  2,  to  become  the  first  president  of  the  United  States  with  Jewish  roots.   “If  my  zayde  (grandfather)  could  see  this  election  ...”  said  Anne  Wein  man,  Cameron  Kerry’s  mother-in  law,  who  with  her  husband,  Joe,   migrated  from  Eastern  Europe.  “Joe  and  I  are  first-generation  Americans;  it  was  inconceivable  back  then  that  we  could  be  connected  to  the  president.”   Kathy  Weinman:  “We  have  to  pinch  ourselves  once  in  a  while.  It’s  amazing  to  have  a  ringside  seat  to  his  tory-in-the-making.”   She  and  their  daughters,  aged  13  and  17,  have  been  campaigning  for  their  uncle,  knocking  on  doors.   Cameron  Kerry,  53,  has  taken  time  off  from  his  Boston  law  firm,  Mintz  Levin,  and  from  his  position  as  a  telecommunications  law  professor  at  Suffolk  Law  School  there,  to  work  on  his  brother’s  presidential  campaign.   Last  week,  stumping  for  his  broth  er  in  Detroit,  he  stayed  with  his  in  laws,  who  keep  a  kosher  kitchen.   Graduating  from  the  University  of  Michigan  Law  School  magna  cum  laude,  Kathy  met  Cameron  -  also  a  magna  cum  laude  graduate  (of  Boston  Law  School).  They  married  in  1983.   Although  brought  up  Catholic,  he  converted  to  Judaism  before  the  mar   riage.  “I  was  influenced  by  Kathy,”  he  said.  “Judaism  is  deeply  held  and  meaningful  to  her.  We  established  we  would  raise  any  children  we  had  as  Jewish.  It  flowed  from  that.   “To  be  a  full  participant  in  their  religious  education,  I  would  convert.”   The  role  of  study  in  Judaism  and  the  value  it  placed  on  learning  and  intellectual  pursuits  appealed  to  him.   Standing  on  the  bima  for  his  daughters’  bat  mitzvahs  as  a  full  par  ticipant  made  his  religious  commit  ment  worth  it,  he  added.   “Judaism  is  central  to  us,”  said  Kathy,  who  is  active  in  her  Boston  synagogue.  “Judaism  is  a  core  of  my  life  and  important  to  our  family.”   Asked  how  the  Catholic  and  Jew  ish  sides  of  the  family  relate,  she  said:  “It’s  a  terrific  relationship.”   Presidential  candidate  John  Kerry  was  supportive  when  his  brother  con  verted  to  Judaism.  John  and  his  family  attended  both  nieces’  baby  namings  and  bat  mitzvahs.  “John’s  loved  partic  ipating  in  our  occasions.  He’s  always   been  there  and  part  of  our  family,”   The  Weinmans  are  active  in  the  Kerry  campaign.   “There’s  nobody  else  I  want  by  my  side  in  a  tough  situation,”  said  Cameron.  “In  times  of  war  and  eco   nomic  challenge,  he’s  the  kind  of   leader  we  need.”   •  Two  other  Democratic  candidates  have  Jewish  connections:  Howard  Dean’s  wife  is  Jewish,  while  Wesley  Clark  comes  from  five  generations  of  rabbis.  They  and  Joseph  Lieberman   have  withdrawn  from  the  race.   CHICAGO  JEWISH  NEWS ",2004-02-20
"  The  Woodford  Folk  Festival  near  die  border  of  Queensland  and  NSW.   Disbelief,  elation  as  Jewish   music  rocks  Queensland  festival   MIRIAM  HECKTMAN   ""THIS  is  Adon  O/am!""  I  argue  with  my  Israeli  born  boyfriend.  ""No  way!""  he  replies  adamantly.  ""I  will  bet  you  $1000  it  is,""  I  retort.  World  music  band  Monsieur  Camembert,  though  only  a  third  Jewish,  are  singing  Adon  Olam  like  I  have  never  heard  it  before.   Here  I  sit  on  a  hay-stacked  floor  under  a  big  tent  in  the  Queensland  bush,  wearing  minimal  attire,  listening  to  a  saxophone  ring  out  this  sacred  prayer.  The  guitar  is  being  strummed  like  Elvis,  singer  Yaron  Hallis  belts  out  the  lyrics  like  a  rock  star,  the  audience  claps  eagerly,  and  I  cannot  contain  the  huge  grin  on  my  face.   My  boyfriend  and  I  look  at  each  other  and  share  a  moment  that  requires  no  verbal  agree  ment.  A  Jewish  prayer  has  been  shared  with  the  masses.  And  maybe  it  doesn't  sound  quite  like  what  Moses  would  have  expected,  or  something  you  would  hear  in  shul,  but  I  feel  proud,  emotional  and  joyous.   To  experience  Jewish  music  outside  a  Jewish  context  is  interesting.   The  Woodford  Folk  Festival  is  held  every   year  around  New  Year  for  six  days.  Located  inland,  near  the  border  of  Queensland  and  NSW,  the  setting  is  remote  and  the  bush  becomes  your  friend.   Camping  is  the  only  accommodation  and  this  humid,  thirsty  bush  land  transforms  into  a  kaleidoscope  of  colourful  tents,  flags  and  glowing  faces.   People  come  from  all  over  the  world  to  par  take  in  this  celebration  of  music  and  culture.   Walking  around  Woodford,  you  feel  the  rever  beration  of  the  tabla  being  drummed,  you  will  hear  a  haunting  lullaby  from  Tibet,  the  sweet  melody  of  a  clarinet  and  the  twisting  sounds  of  the  hurdy-gurdy.  It  is  an  aural  and  visual  extrava  ganza.  Culturally,  it  is  an  eye  opener  and  a  moment  of  peace  between  the  peoples.   This  year  boasted  a  handful  of  Jewish  artists,  the  most  renowned  being  Sheva  from  Israel  and  Monsieur  Camembert  from  Sydney.  Other  Jewish  artists  included  Lior  from  Sydney,  new  Israeli  group  Ma'ayan,  which  recently  formed  in  Byron  Bay,  and  Sefarad,  which  includes  Ladino  duo  Oscar  and  Marigold  from  Sydney.   Miriam  Hechtman  (front,  second  from  left)  with  friends  at  the  Woodford  Folk  Festival.   I  recall  helping  a  disabled  older  woman  from  Queensland  enter  the  festival  on  the  last  day.  I  asked  her  what  had  been  the  highlight  for  her.  She  replied  enthusiastically  that  she  really  liked  that  band  ""Sheeva""  and  ""that   French  band.  What's  their  name?""   I  suggested  Monsieur  Camembert.  Words  can  be  misunderstood,  names  mispronounced  and  still  a  meeting  of  spirits  has  been  encoun   tered.   Sheva  has  come  a  long  way  since  their  whirlwind  tour  in  2003  when  they  played  to  small  audiences,  mostly  Jews.  Certainly  their  music  is  catchy;  it  is  difficult  to  simply  sit  through  a  Sheva  concert.  But  there  must  be  something  more.   Perhaps  it  is  their  message  of  peace  and  love  that  transcends  language  and  ethnicity  or  maybe  it  is  something  deeper,  something  in  the  history  of  the  instruments,  or  the  ancient  hum  of  the  language.   ""Can  you  translate  just  one  of  the  lines  for  us?  We  have  had  their  CD  for  a  year,  but  we  cannot  sing  along  because  we  do  not  have  the  words""  -  I  was  asked  by  a  Sheva  devotee.   To  be  able  to  share  my  language  felt  like  an   honour.   Unhesitatingly,  I  wrote  the  words  ""Salaam,  Aleinu  ve'al  kol  ha'olam""  phonetically  and  translated  its  meaning  (Sheer  gratitude  for  each  of  us).   As  the  sun  sets,  I  find  myself  sitting  on  the  hilltop  with  thousands  of  others  for  the  final  fire  show.  I  am  exhausted,  yet  elated.   The  fire  show  at  Woodford  draws  the  biggest  crowd,  and  this  year  is  no  exception.  An  indigenous  Australian  ignites  a  fire  from   wood  with  his  bare  hands.   And  then  an  entrancing  voice  melts  into  the  soundscape.  The  melody  is  lingering,  yet  measured.  I  recognise  the  tune  and  though  the  words  are  difficult  to  grasp,  I  know  it  a  Jewish  dance,  a  debka.   ""It's  a  Hebrew  song!  Ivrit!""  I  tell  my  friends,  ""A  Hebrew  song  at  the  final  show  of  Woodford!""  A  group  of  people  begin  the  dance;  three  claps  to  the  left,  one  clap  to  the  right.   I  am  spellbound.  My  heart  soars.  Once  again  I  find  myself  in  a  vortex  of  disbelief,  joy  and  surprise.  The  worlds  have  collided.  The  separation  I  usually  feel  about  being  Jewish  has  evaporated  in  the  fires.  Pride  and  a  sense  of  history  and  culture  pervade  my  being.  You  can  rediscover  Jewish  music  out  in  the  bush  in  Queensland.   Miriam  Hechtman  is  editor  of  the   Australian  Jewish  News  Kids'  Stuff  page. ",2004-01-16
"  Key  issues  facing  Jewish  voters  on  October  9   MICHAEL  CAVANAGH   SECURITY,  Israel  and  education  and  aged  care  are  among  the  key  issues  preoccupying  Jewish  voters  as  Australia  gears  for  the  election  on   October  9.   “Those  are  the  big  three,”  said  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones,  although  “there  are  also  many  other  issues.   Recourse  for  victims  of  racial  vilifica   tion  and  accountability  of  govern   ment  broadcasters  have  also  become   relevant  to  the  Jewish  community.   “We  are  aware  that  all  the  groups  that  threaten  Australia  generally  threaten  Jews  specifically,”  he  added.   “And  a  large  percentage  of  the  Jew  ish  community  are  ageing  and  have  needs  that  may  not  have  been  recog  nised  in  the  past.”   Prime  Minister  John  Howard  has  been  a  vocal  and  strong  supporter  of  Israel  and  the  Jewish  community,  and  with  Foreign  Minister  Alexander  Downer,  has  backed  its  right  to  defend  itself,  including  the  construc  tion  of  its  security  barrier.   Although  both  have  voiced  con  cern  over  its  route,  Australia  earlier  this  year  was  one  of  only  five  coun  tries  to  support  Israel  in  voting  against  a  UN  resolution  condemning   Israel  for  the  barrier.   Since  Latham’s  elevation  to  the   Labor  leadership,  criticism  of  Israel  from  within  the  party  has  been   Prime  minister  John  Howard...  A  vocal   and  strong  supporter  of  Israel  and  the  Jewish  community.   muted  in  comparison  to  when  Simon  Crean  held  the  reins.  During  the  war  on  Iraq,  Beazley,  also  a  strong  sup  porter  of  Israel,  visited  the  country.   Labor  too  has  defended  the  securi   ty  barrier,  although  Shadow  Foreign  Minister  Kevin  Rudd  argued  that  Australia  should  have  abstained  in  the  UN  vote.   MP  Michael  Danby  countered   Opposition  Leader  Mark  Latham...  Since   his  elevation  to  the  leadership,  criticism  of  Israel  within  the  party  has  been  muted.   negative  reaction  by  noting  that  the  government  has  also  previously  abstained  on  UN  votes  on  Israel.   There  are  three  Jewish  candidates  standing:  Danby,  the  Melbourne  Ports  incumbent,  who  is  opposed  by  David  Southwick—the  first  time  Jew  ish  candidates  will  oppose  each  other  representing  the  major  parties;  and  David  Ritter,  who  will  represent   Labor  in  the  West  Australian  seat  of   Pearce,  which  is  currently  held  by  the  Liberal  Party’s  Judi  Moylan.   Wentworth  and  Melbourne  Ports   -  the  electorates  with  the  largest  Jewish  populations  -  have  a  similar  history,  although  voters  differ  as  to  which  party  they  traditionally  back.   Melbourne  Ports  has  voted  Labor  since  1906,  with  Labor’s  Michael  Danby  scoring  a  5.7  per  cent  margin  in  the  2001  election,  while  Conserva  tive  parties  have  held  Wentworth  -  the  country’s  smallest  electorate  -   since  Federation  in  1901.   However,  the  battle  for  Wentworth  has  a  twist  which  makes  the  outcome   less  predictable.  At  the  time  of  going  to  press,  incumbent  Peter  King,  who  was  ousted  in  a  preselection  bathe  with  Malcolm  Turnbull,  had  yet  to  decide  whether  to  contest  the  seat  as  an  independent  (report  page  9).   Danby  believes  the  appointment  of  Kim  Beazley  as  Defence  spokesman  reflects  Labor’s  commit  ment  to  fighting  terrorism.   Danby’s  opponent  in  Melbourne  Ports  is  also  unequivocal  when  it  comes  to  terrorism.  “The  Jewish  com  munity  in  particular  understands  the  importance  of  Australia  going  to  war  on  Iraq  and  has  been  very  supportive  of  the  outcomes  of  that  war,”  says  Lib  eral  candidate  David  Southwick,  who  is  also  Jewish.   Education  has  both  sides  working  hard  to  secure  the  Jewish  vote,  with   Labor  candidates  trying  to  counter  concerns  that  under  a  Latham-led  administration  a  needs-based  system  could  see  some  Jewish  schools  receive  less  funding.   Conceding  that  that  could  occur,  Danby  argues  he  has  been  able  to  convince  Shadow  Education  Minister  Jenny  Macklin  that  the  dayschools  qualify  for  special  consideration.  He  also  maintains  that  schools  such  as  Mount  Scopus  will  be  considered  under  Labor  because  of  the  difference  between  the  “nominally  high  fees  and  what  they  actually  collect”.   David  Patch,  who  is  trying  to  wrest  Wentworth  from  the  Liberals,  has  also  backed  Jewish  dayschool  funding.  However,  while  he  argues  that  under  Labor  most  students  at  independent  schools  would  be  better  off,  “it  was  too  early  to  say  if  there  would  be  reduced  spending  for  private  schools  in  Wentworth”,  he  added.   Turnbull  claims  that  Labor  would  “penalise”  parents  who  send  children  to  independent  schools.

"  Victorian  Yachad  advisory  board  member  Nina  Bassat  gives  former  NAB  chief  executive   Frank  Cicutto  a  gift  at  last  week’s  function.  Photo:  Photonet   Jewish  leaders  pay  tribute   to  former  NAB  chief   DAN  GOLDBERG   IT  began  in  1997  when  Frank  Cicutto,  then  CEO  of  the  National  Australia  Bank  (NAB),  decided  that  the  bank  would  become  the  national  patron  of  the  United  Israel  Appeal  (UIA).   Five  years  later,  Cicutto  realised  that  Australia  could  benefit  from  the  many  Jewish  community  organisations  which  have  close  relationships  with  Israel.   Enter  the  NAB  Yachad  Scholarship  Fund,  Cicutto’s  brainchild  which  pro  vides  scholarships  for  talented  Aus  tralians  to  go  to  Israel.   This  in  turn  has  spawned  the  Yachad  Accelerated  Learning  Project,  an  initia  tive  which  applies  Israel’s  successful  inte  gration  of  Bedouins  and  Ethiopians,  to  help  improve  the  plight  of  Australia’s  indigenous  communities.   Cicutto,  who  lost  his  job  earlier  this  year  and  is  therefore  no  longer  chairman  of  the  fund,  was  honoured  by  Jewish  community  leaders  for  his  dedication  and  vision  at  a  function  at  law  firm  Arnold  Bloch  Leibler  last  week.   He  recalled  how  he  and  his  wife   Christine  “had  tears  in  our  eyes”  as  they   watched  a  UIA  video  of  the  rescue  and  resettlement  in  Israel  of  Jews  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  in  the  late  1990s.   “I  will  never  forget  the  impact  of  those  images,”  he  said.   The  Yachad  Accelerated  Learning  Project  was  conceived  following  the  return  of  the  fund’s  inaugural  fellow,  Professor  Marcia  Langton,  from  Israel  in  February  2003.   Described  by  Cicutto  as  “an  initiative  of  truly  nationwide  importance”,  the  Federal  Government  has  pledged  $3  million  over  three  years  to  the  project   An  Israeli  educational  team  will  arrive  in  January  next  year  to  live  and  work  in  Cape  York,  East  Kimberley  and  Shepparton  and,  according  to  Professor  Langton,  by  the  time  the  project  con  cludes  in  2007,  more  than  150  Australian  teachers  and  their  classes  will  have  expe  rienced  accelerated  learning.   Yachad  Fund  deputy  chair  Mark  Leibler  paid  tribute  to  Cicutto’s  “person  al  vision  and  commitment  [which  has]  developed  an  unprecedented  relation  ship  between  a  leading  Australian  corpo  ration  and  the  Australian  Jewish  community”.   Cicutto’s  successor  at  the  NAB,  John  Stewart,  said  the  financial  institution  was  committed  to  the  initiative.   Thirteen  Australian  scholars  have  travelled  to  Israel  since  2002.  Another   five  have  been  selected  for  next  year. ",2004-11-12
"  Wielding  the  bagel  over  a  Jewish  book  club   BEYOND  WORDS   RUTH  WAJNRYB   It's  part  of  our  tragedy   that  we  know  only  too  well  how  we  get   embroiled  in  other  people's  tsouris.   THE  Sydney  Morning  Herald  has  a   column  (Heckler)  where  readers  are  invited  to  send  in  a  rant   about  something  that  gets  on  their  goat.   What  usually  emerges  is  a  humor  ous  deconstruction  of,  or  a  sustained  diatribe  against,  some  familiar  ele  ment  of  contemporary  life.   A  recent  contributor  (Mary  Wat  son  30/9)  took  on  the  institution  of  the  book  club.  This  is  a  group  of  peo  ple  who  meet  at  regular  intervals  to  discuss  a  book  they’ve  agreed  to  read.   It’s  mostly  a  female  thing,  for  who  knows-why  reasons.  Do  women  read   more?  Do  women  have  more  time  to   read?  Do  women  like  sitting  around  talking  about  books?  Are  men  deterred  by  the  absence  of  sex,  vio  lence  or  contact  sports?   Certainly,  the  ubiquitously  thriv  ing  phenomenon  of  readers’  groups  seems  to  satisfy  some  primordial   needs  in  homo  readiens.   Watson  says  while  the  theory  is  good  -  what’s  nicer  than  analysing  a   novel  for  the  sheer  fun  of  it?  -  the  reality  varies.  She  confesses  that  her  all-round  time  poverty  makes  reading   difficult.   However,  with  a  few  resourceful  tips,  she  suggests  how  you  can  skip  the  reading,  attend  your  group  and  fake  it   I  won’t  duplicate  her  strategies  here  are  for  fear  of  encouraging  dis   honesty.  In  any  case,  in  my  reading  group  experience,  the  state  of  not  having-read-the-book  is  nothing  approaching  shameful.   In  fact,  with  us,  the  only  angst  triggering  issue  might  be  failure  to   contribute  a  dish  to  the  feast.  Because  it’s  the  feast  that  is  the  literal  and   metaphorical  centre;  the  book’s  only  a  pretext  to  get  together.   More  and  more  as  the  years  go  by,   the  book  we’re  meant  to  have  read   gets  dipped  into  (good  verb  choice,  that)  less  and  less.  A  day  is  coming  when  we’ll  meet,  greet,  eat  and  leave,  unmindful  of  the  fact  that,  well,  once  were  book  readers.   Well,  it’s  a  Jewish  book  group.  For  purposes  of  comparison,  I  once  attend  ed  another  group  as  an  invited  guest.   Totally  different,  it  was.  Orderly,  proper  -  think  British  Army  uniforms  compared  to  Israeli  -  a  set  format.   We  sat  around  in  the  lounge  room,  food  (dips  and  olives)  were  a  stretch  away,  hard  to  navigate  from  lounge  chairs  (better  not  to  try),  remaining  mostly  untouched.   And  wine,  of  course.  Clearly,  for  this  group,  the  reading/talking  about  reading  constituted  the  main  agenda.   In  the  Jewish  group,  we  sit  around  a  dining-room  table.  Easy  access  to  every  dish.  We  don’t  pretend  we’re  there  for  any  higher-order  activity.  People  stand  on  litde  ceremony.  One   member  has  impudently  taken  to  calling  us  an  “eating  group”.  There   was  once  a  bottle  of  wine.   But  what  makes  this  book  group  Jewish?  Well,  for  starters,  everyone  is  Jewish.  This  wasn’t  policy.  It  just  hap  pened.  It  may  change.  In  fact  we’ve  just  welcomed  out  first  honorary  Jew   as  member.   Secondly,  as  mentioned,  there’s  the  food.  At  our  first  meeting  where  we  wrote  the  rules,  I  asked  for  a  vote  on  whether  we  should  eat  before  or  after  we  talk  about  the  book.   They  looked  at  me,  as  one  face,  aghast.  The  vote  was  neither  “before”  nor  “after”  but  “with”.  And  “with”,  it  became  and  so  it  remained.   The  food  is  laid  out  banquet  style;  everyone  brings  something;  we  have  rigidified  into  roles.  We  do  miss  John  when  he’s  absent,  and  we  also  miss  his  salmon.  Jeanette’s  great  with  the  bagels.  Kathy’s  the  cheese  person,  Pam  does  a  great  fresh-fruit  platter;  someone  always  brings  an  illegal  cake   or  three.   Third  is  the  fact  that  we  inevitably  end  up  talking  about  matters  of  rele  vance  to  Jews.  Again  not  deliberate.  It’s  that  old  joke.   Question:  what  does  a  Jew  think  when  he  hears  on  the  news  that  a  herd  of  elephants  passed  wind  in  Outer  Mongolia?   Answer:  is  this  good  for  the  Jews?   It’s  part  of  our  tragedy  that  we  know  only  too  well  how  we  get  embroiled  in  other  people’s  tsouris.   Subversively,  we  decided  not  to  deny  but  rather  to  formalise  our  Jew  ish  predilection.  Barry  was  awarded  the  task  of  internet-searching  the  Jew  ish  connection  to  any  book  we  agreed  to  read,  however  tangential.   But  the  feature  of  this  group  that  more  than  any  other  makes  it  Jewish  is  its  discourse  style.  Think  of  the  very  opposite  to  the  Angloid  group  I  men  tioned  earlier.  With  us,  everyone  talks  at  any  time.  Anyone  talks  all  of  the  time.  Everyone  talks  over  everyone  else.  No-one  can  sustain  an  extended  turn  without  experiencing  interjec  tion  at  every  utterance.   It’s  not  that  we  have  no  insight  into  our  verbal  behaviour.  In  a  noble  spir  it  of  self-regulation,  we  adopted  the  system  of  having  the  person  who  held  the  floor  hold  up  a  specially  designat  ed  bagel  on  the  end  of  a  fork.   The  code  was  visually  immediate,  powerfully  symbolic.  The  bagel  wielder  had  discourse  legitimacy  -  the  right  to  hold  the  bagel  was  the  right  to  the  floor  and  everyone’s   attention.   It  worked  for  about  four  minutes.

"  Art$&amp;Books   Jewish  action  hero  the  ideal  tonic  for  stressful  times   JAN  EPSTEIN   FEATHERS  were  ruffled  in  America   last  December  by  the  unleashing  on  unsuspecting  filmgoers  of  Mordechai  Jefferson  Carver,  known  to  his  friends  and  enemies  alike  as  “the  Hebrew  Hammer”   Mordy,  as  his  mother  calls  him,  is  “the  baddest  Hebe  this  side  of  Tel  Aviv”  and  the  first  Jewish  action  hero  since  Judah  Maccabeus.   He  is  also  the  alter  ego  of  Jonathan  Baruch  Kesselman,  28,  who  is  fresh  out  of  film  school  and  is  determined  to  counter  Jewish  stereotyping  by  his  crass  but  clever  appropriation  of  “blaxploitation”   films.   Black  exploitation  films  in  the  early  1970s  set  out  to  use  black  stereotypes  and  turn  African  Amer   icans  into  heroes.   Often  crude  and  offensive  by  industry  standards,  films  such  as  Gordon  Parks’  Shaft  and  Melvin  van  Peebles’  Sweet  Sweetback’s  Baadasssss  Song  put  black  faces  on  the  screen  in  roles  that  were  nor   mally  reserved  exclusively  for   whites.   And  with  his  debut  feature  film,  The  Hebrew  Hammer,  this  is  pre  cisely  what  Kesselman,  the  self  styled  godfather  of  “Jewxploitation”  films,  is  trying  to  do  for  Jews.   Based  on  his  award-winning  short  film  made  while  a  student  at   the  University  of  Southern  Califor  nia  School  of  Cinema  and  Televi  sion,  Kesselman’s  story  finds  Mordy,  a  private  investigator,  locked  in   mortal  combat  with  a  bad  Santa  called  Damian  Claus,  who  wants  to  rid  the  world  of  Chanukah.   “I  think  young  Jews  right  now  are  searching  for  identity,”  Kessel   man  said  in  a  telephone  interview  from  Los  Angeles.   “I’m  very  culturally  Jewish.  I  love  being  Jewish,  and  the  film  for  me  is  an  expression  of  what  a  lot  of  Jews   in  America  feel.   “They  love  to  be  Jewish,  but  they  worry:  if  I’m  not  religious,  am  I  less  of  a  Jew,  or  more  than  a  Jew?   “This  film  is  about  being  ‘racial  ly’  Jewish.  If  you  move  away  from  the  dictionary,  people  share  a  com  mon  background,  customs,  culture.  Jews  have  all  of  these  things,  even  the  look  So  to  me  being  Jewish  is  a  racial  thing.”   ""I  wanted  to  make  being  Jewish  cool...  I  revel  in  my  neuroses.  I  like  being  Jewish.”   JONATHAN  KESSELMAN   Director   Kesselman’s  grandparents  migrated  from  Russia  and  Germany  in  the  early  20th  century  to  Ameri  ca.  While  his  father’s  family  lived  in  New  York  and  are  Orthodox,  Kessel  man  was  raised  in  Los  Angeles.   “I  grew  up  in  Los  Angeles,  in  the  melting  pot,  and  never  bought  into  the  notion  of  Jews  being  uncool,”  he   said.   “I  wanted  to  make  being  Jewish  cool.  Right  now,  the  cool  culture  in  America  is  black  culture.  Black  cul  ture  has  become  mainstream  cul  ture.  Hip-hop  is  American  culture.  I  wanted  to  fuse  these  things.   “The  whole  notion  of  cool  is  the  idea  of  not  caring  what  others  think.  I  think  this  is  what  the  movie  does.  I  am  who  I  am.  I  revel  in  my  neuroses.  I  like  being  Jewish.”   While  Jewish/black  relations  can  be  seen  to  have  deteriorated  since   the  years  of  solidarity  during  the  civil-rights  movement  of  the  1960s,  Kesselman  said  the  tide  was  turning  and  that  extremists  such  as  Louis   Farrakhan  represented  a  fringe  minority.   “I  never  really  understood  the  fighting  between  Jews  and  blacks  in  New  York  that  you  heard  on  the  news  every  day.  We’re  both  minori   ties.  I  don’t  understand  how  two   people  who  have  so  much  in  com  mon  are  fighting  like  that.  It  made   no  sense  to  me.”   It  was  important  for  Kesselman  that  blacks  and  Jews  came  together   in  The  Hebrew  Hammer.  Mario  Pee   bles  plays  Mohammed,  the  leader  of   a  Black  Panther-like  liberation  movement  called  the  KLF  (Kwanzaa  Liberation  Front),  while  his  father  Melvin  Van  Peebles  also  has  a  part  in  the  film.   “The  fact  that  Mario  and  his  father  wanted  to  be  in  the  film  meant  a  lot  to  me.  They  added  legit  imacy,  because  Melvin  is  the  creator  of  blaxploitation,  and  Mario’s  actu  ally  in  Sweetback  [as  a  child].  I  think  that  was  part  of  the  attraction  for  them.  They  too  felt  the  kinship.”   Kesselman  sees  the  Hammer  as  a  classic  movie  hero  and  is  reluctant   to  compare  his  character  (played  by  Jewish  actor  Adam  Goldberg)  with  Woody  Allen’s  “nebbish”  persona.   “I  am  what  I  am  and  I  write  what  comes  out  of  me.  I’m  writing  my  life  as  a  Jew,”  he  said.   Kesselman  believes  there  has  never  been  a  really  cool,  strong,  Jew  ish  leading  man  and  is  critical  of  the  standard  Hollywood  Jewish  charac  ter  who  is  portrayed  as  the  neurotic  best  friend,  or  the  wimpy  intellect.   Director  kuiatfian  teten  takes  a  break  during  ttis  filming  of  The  Hebrew  Hammer.   “I  wanted  to  have  an  ass-kicking  Jew.  I’ve  never  really  seen  that.  I’m  not  saying  that  all  Jews  should  be  that  way,  but  I  do  like  seeing  the  classic  American  hero  as  a  Jew.”   Asked  about  Mel  Gibson’s   reported  comments  that  he  would   like  to  make  a  film  about  the  Mac  cabees,  Kesselman  said:  “Yeah,  like  ly!  That’s  just  him  trying  to  appease  the  Jewish  community!”   Pressed  about  Gibson’s  The  Pas   sion  of  the  Christ,  the  young  director  was  very  forthcoming.   “I  didn’t  believe  that  the  film  was   going  to  be  antisemitic.  I  thought   that  was  an  overreactionhe  said.   “So  I  went  to  see  it  and  I  do  think  it’s  antisemitic.  I  have  a  Jewish  friend  who  went  to  see  it  and  when  he  came  out  he  told  me  he  wanted  to  kill  a  Jew  himself!   “Everything  in  that  film  pointed   to  the  Jews  being  blamed  for  the'  killing  of  Christ.  Maybe  I  overreact  ed,  but  it  sort  of  scares  me  that  a  film  like  this  can  be  so  successful.”   The  Hebrew  Hammer  is  currently   screening  in  cinemas. ",2004-04-09
"  A  true  believer  remembers  the  Jewish  left   BOOK  REVIEW   PHILIP  MENDES   SUCH  WAS  LIFE:  A  JUMPING  NARRATIVE  FROM  RADOM  TO  MELBOURNE  Itzhak  Gust  Makor,  $28   THE  late  Itzhak  Gust  was  one  of  Melbourne  Jewry’s  best-known  communists  in  the  1930s,  ’40s  and  ’50s.  This  text  records  his  life  from   birth  to  the  age  of  65  (although  he  actually  lived  till  the  age  of  90),  and  is  based  on  letters  sent  to  his  daugh  ter,  the  well-known  writer,  Amirah  Gust-Inglis.   Gust  was  bom  into  a  traditional   Jewish  family  in  Radom,  Poland,  in  1898.  By  13  he  had  discarded  religion  and  he  managed  to  attend  the  state  high  school  despite  the  quotas  on  Jewish  students,  and  opposition  from  his  own  grandparents  and  uncles.  But  he  held  few  fond  memories  of  his  birthplace,  recalling  that  many  Jews  were  “strangers  in  their  home”.   During  World  War  I,  Gust  and  his   family  were  forced  to  relocate  to  the  town  of  Mariupol  in  Russia.  Gust  found  the  Russians  far  more  hos  pitable  with  little  overt  antisemitism.  He  soon  became  involved  in  radical  politics  including  labour  Zionist  groups.  In  1918,  Gust  and  five  of  his  friends  departed  for  Palestine.   Gust  spent  eight  years  working  in   communal  Jewish  settlements,  but  became  increasingly  disillusioned  by  the  gap  he  perceived  between  Zion  ist  socialist  ideals,  and  the  reality  of  dispossessing  the  local  Arab  popula  tion.  After  a  brief  period  in  Belgium,  he  moved  to  Australia  in  1923  and  was  soon  joined  by  his  wife  and  daughter.   Gust  found  Melbourne  to  be  a   friendly  and  welcoming  city,  and  he  soon  found  comfortable  employ  ment  in  a  Carlton  handbag  factory.  Later,  he  progressed  to  joint  owner  ship  of  the  factory,  and  to  other  suc  cessful  business  ventures.   He  joined  the  Communist  Party   and  the  associated  Friends  of  the  Soviet  Union  (FOSU).  In  1932,  Gust  travelled  to  the  Soviet  Union  as  part  of  a  FOSU  delegation,  and  spent  a  number  of  months  working  in  a  Soviet  leather  factory.   On  his  return  to  Australia,  Gust  addressed  a  number  of  public  meet  ings,  and  was  formally  investigated  by  the  Commonwealth  Investigation  Branch.  Later  Gust  was  publicly  named  by  the  1949  Lowe  Royal   Commission  into  Communism  as  an  important  donor  to  the  Commu  nist  Party.  This  lead  to  further  sur  veillance  and  monitoring  by  the  security  service.  Gust  “believed  him  self  to  be  a  rationalist  and  a  sceptic”,  but  in  practice  he  lived  “by  a  pas   sionate  faith”  in  the  Soviet  Union.   Gust  provides  some  wonderful  vignettes  of  major  Melbourne  Jewish  personalities,  including  key  leaders  of  the  early  Melbourne  Jew  ish  left  and  the  Melbourne  Jewish  Council  to  Combat  Fascism  and  Antisemitism.  Gust  played  a  key  role  in  the  council  and  acknowledges  its  intransigence  regarding  West  Ger  many  and  how  Soviet  antisemitism  contributed  to  the  decline  of  its  sup  port  in  the  Jewish  community.   This  is  an  entertaining  book  about  a  man  who  led  an  interesting  and  passionate  life.  It  will  particularly  appeal  to  those  interested  in  stories  of  Jewish  migration,  and  the  dynamics  of  the  early  Melbourne  Jewish  left.

"  Memo  to  Jewish  principals:  abolish  homework   PARTISAN   SAMUPSKI   Wouldn’t  it  be   marvelous  if  the  Jewish  dayschools  set  an   example  and  agreed  to  abolish  all  homework,  in  every  subject,  for  all   students  up  to  Year  10,   and  then  set  strict  limits  of  a  half-hour  daily,  then  an  hour  in  Year  11?   THE  Jewish  Educators’  Confer   ence  in  Melbourne  this  weekend,  as  with  most  conferences,  can  either  be  a  warm  bath  or  a  cold  show  er.  My  gratuitous  advice:  go  for  the   cold  shower.   “Warm  bath”  conferences  are  for  “luwies”  who  all  know  each  other,  basically  agree  with  each  other  and  don’t  have  to  be  told  who  the  enemy  is.  These  are  the  conferences,  especial  ly  among  committed  and  communi  ty-minded  Jews,  where  the  papers  and  speakers  are  secondary.  That’s  because  everybody  can  recite  the  themes  and  main  points  in  advance,  and  where  it’s  primarily  about  net  working  over  the  bagel  lunches.   By  contrast,  “cold  shower”  confer   ences  are  those  where  at  least  one  or   two  speakers  from  the  podium  actu  ally  challenge  the  collective  conven  tional  wisdom,  and  where  all  those  attending  go  away  forced  to  rethink  -   and  defend  or  redefine  -  at  least  one   of  their  cherished  core  assumptions.   As  the  conference  organiser,  the   Zionist  Federation  of  Australia  was   good  enough  to  invite  me  to  speak  at  the  weekend,  and  as  I  was  unable  to  accept  due  to  a  prior  obligation,  what   follows  is  what  I  would  have  said.   If  it’s  not  quite  the  full  cold  show  er,  I  hope  it’s  at  least  “a  hant  in  kalt  vasser”,  as  we  say  in  French.   K’vod  harabanim,  distinguished  visi  tors,  ladies  and  gentlemen.   I’d  like  to  suggest  three  very  mod  est  and  very  cool  initiatives  that  you  might  consider  as  a  contribution  to  the  sector  as  a  whole,  i.e.  our  dayschools,  non-dayschool  education  boards,  and  informal  education  net  works.  The  proposals  are  about  data,  continuity  and  linkage,  and   innovation.   Firsdy,  confronting  and  difficult  as  it  might  sound,  please  use  your  col  lective  and  particular  influence  with  in  your  various  institutions  to  encourage  some  vital  independent  surveys  to  gather  some  reliable  data.  We  all  need  to  know  just  how  effective  those  institutions  are,  over  the  longer  term,  in  their  various  and  differential  approaches  to  Jewish  literacy  and  the  maintenance  of  Jewish  identity.   I  don’t  imagine  that  a  conference  of  Jewish  educators  would  regard  outstanding  academic  results  in  gen  eral  studies  as  a  sufficient,  and  cer  tainly  not  a  necessary  justification,  for  an  extensive  enterprise  of  some  20  schools.   So  if  we  agree  that  the  only  raison  d’etre  for  our  dayschools  is  that  what  ever  else  they  do  well  educationally,  they  are  ultimately  critical  to  Jewish  identity,  then  surely  it’s  time  -  after  more  than  50  years  -  to  measure  how  effective  they  are,  in  different  ways,  at  delivering  it   As  of  now,  I’m  not  aware  that  any  such  current,  comprehensive,  reliable   and  relevant  data  exists.  Indeed,  I  know  that  some  schools  have  actively   resisted  even  the  most  limited  of  sur   veys  on  this  admittedly  touchy  and  complex  subject.   But  this  is  not  just  about  the  dayschools.  The  surveys  should  encompass  all  our  educational  enter  prises  such  as  the  United  Jewish  Eductaion  Board  and  Academy  Board  of  Jewish  Education,  as  well  as  the  youth  movements.  Without  such  data  the  community’s  investment  of  immense  capital  and  human  resources  over  the  next  crucial  decade  will  continue  to  be  a  matter  of  intu  ition,  impression  and  assertion.  Which  is  no  way  to  run  a  railroad,  let  alone  Jewish  identity.   Secondly,  please  use  this  confer  ence  to  create  more  continuity  between  biennial  conferences  and  more  linkage  within  the  sector,  i.e.  between  the  dayschools,  the  educa  tion  boards  and  the  youth  move  ments.  Whether  this  means  an  umbrella  Australian  Jewish  Educa  tors’  Council  or  Network  (AJEC/N)  or  another  acrostic,  is  a  matter  for  the  conference.  But  in  an  internet  age,  keeping  the  hundreds  of  Jewish  edu  cators  —  not  just  the  principals  —  around  Australia  informed  and  less   isolated  geographically  and,  dare  I  say  it,  ideologically,  is  hardly  brain   science.   Finally,  I  believe  it’s  time  that  the   Jewish  educational  sector,  however  small  by  national  standards,  provided  an  innovative  model  -  apart  from  its  high  academic  results  -  for  others  in  Australia,  much  as  the  Jewish  welfare  sector  has  done  for  more  than  half-a  century.   So,  to  flog  a  hobbyhorse  of  mine  for  the  past  30  years  which  I  thought  was  dead  but  has  miraculously   revived  in  the  news  media  in  recent  weeks,  let’s  abolish  homework,  at  least  until  Year  10.   As  some  principals  and  teachers  here  may  ruefully  recall,  I’ve  tried,  unsuccessfully,  to  ride  my  hobby  horse  through  five  Jewish  dayschools  where  I’ve  been  a  parent.  So  I’m  biased,  even  if  I  admit  to  feeling  just  a   touch  vindicated.  But  come  on:  wouldn’t  it  be  marvelous  if  the  Jewish  dayschools  set  an  example  and  agreed  to  abolish  all  homework,  in  every  subject,  for  all  students  up  to  Year  10,   and  then  set  strict  limits  of  a  half  hour  daily,  then  an  hour  in  Year  11?   Apart  from  all  the  other  benefits  that  I’m  convinced  would  accrue  to  students,  teachers  and  families,  I’d  argue  it  would  also  specifically  help  the  cause  of  Jewish  studies.  (I  won’t  touch  Year  12.  How  many  cold  show  ers  can  we  have?)   Do  enjoy  the  conference.   Sam  Lipski  is  CEO  of  the  Pratt  Foundation  and  a  former  editor  of  the   AJN.

"  A  few  words  can   The  path  to  Jewish  renewal   starts  with  a  few  simple  words,  writes  GEORGE  D  HANUS.   It  is  the  Shema  that  constituted  the  last  words  on  the  lips  of  individuals  about  to   meet  their  maker,  from  the  time  of  the  murders  of  Rabbi  Akiva  and  his  students  to  the  martyrs  and  victims  of  the  Holocaust.   THE  Jewish  world  has  just  cele   brated  Shavuot,  commemorat  ing  the  introduction  of  the  Torah  to  the  Jewish  people   and  the  world.  This  event’s  impact  has  changed  the  course  of  human  his   tory.   The  rabbis  saw  the  recitation  of  the  Shema  as  a  recapitulation  of  the  revelation  at  Mount  Sinai.  It  is  the   quintessential  Jewish  prayer  that  encapsulates  what  it  means  to  be  a  Jew.  Traditionally,  Jews  have  recited  it  upon  waking  in  the  morning  and  before  retiring  at  bedtime.   The  Shema  consists  of  six  words:  “Shema  Yisrael,  Adonai  Eloheinu,  Adonai  echad  -  Hear  O  Israel,  the  Lord  is  our  God,  the  Lord  is  one.”   These  six  words  have  shaped  the  spiritual  development  of  millions  of  souls  throughout  our  history.  They  are  the  4000-year-old  direct  and  unal  tered  link  between  the  Jews  at  Mount  Sinai  and  the  Jews  of  modernity.  It  is  the  Shema  that  constituted  the  last  words  on  the  lips  of  individuals  about  to  meet  their  maker,  from  the  time  of  the  murders  of  Rabbi  Akiva  and  his   students  to  the  martyrs  and  victims  of   the  Holocaust.   The  essential  meaning  of  this  prayer  is  that  notwithstanding  the  powerful  forces  of  objects  of  alternate  worship  -  power,  money,  celebrity  -  Jews  must  focus  their  worship  on  a  God  that  is  singular,  unified  and  harmonious.   These  six  words  attest  to  the  inner   strength  and  conviction  needed  to  follow  the  right  path,  despite  alluring  influences  that  pull  us  in  other  direc  tions.  These  words  reaffirm  our  covenant  with  God  as  a  nation.  Not  as  individuals,  but  as  one  people.   But  it  is  particularly  important  to  understand  that  the  next  verse  after  these  sue  words  is  the  concept  of   The  words   “Shema  Yisrael”  feature  on  an  Israeli  stamp   commemorating  Yarn  Hashoah.   “v’shinantam  lVanecha”.  The  message  is  clear.  After  we,  as  individuals,  accept  and  understand  the  meaning  of  our  Jewish  affiliation,  we  as  a  community  are  obligated  to  teach  our  heritage  to   all  of  our  children.   Regrettably,  somehow  over  time,  we  have  evolved  into  a  Jewish  com  munity  galvanised  solely  by  the  nega  tive  threats  of  external  enemies.  Quite  understandably,  we  have  developed  communal  organisations  that  vocifer  ously  speak  out  against  antisemitism  and  that  are  ferocious  in  their  vigi  lance  against  various  ills:  anti  defamation,  anti-poverty,  anti  discrimination  and  anti-terrorism.  We  have  become  the  “never-again”  generation  —  but  along  the  way,  we  seem  to  have  forgotten  the  simple   words  of  the  Shema.   Israeli  writer  Aharon  Appelfeld  described  modern  Jews  as  having  amputated  our  past,  leaving  a  black   hole  of  identity  in  place  of  the  inter  nal  organs  of  our  soul.  We  must  alter   this  condition.   A  magnificently  simple  but  power  ful  instrument  of  faith  has  recendy  been  initiated  by  American  psycholo  gist,  Steve  Neren.  It  is  called  the  “Shema  Campaign”.   The  brilliance  lies  in  its  easily  understood  directive.  What  if  every  Jew  said,  with  clarity  and  forcefulness,  the  six  words  of  the  Shema  just  before  going  to  bed  every  night?  What  if  every  mother  and  father  recited  these   six  words  with  their  children  at  bed  time  just  before  they  gave  them  a  goodnight  kiss?  What  if  every  grand  child  called  their  grandparent  at  night  and  recited  the  six  words  togedier?   Think  of  the  memories  and  impres  sions  every  child  would  have.  This  action  is  easy  to  take  and  doesn’t  cost  a  penny,  but  the  potential  impact  on  the  future  of  our  children  s  path  is  incalcu   lable.  What  would  the  future  of  the  Jewish  people  look  like,  if  all  of  our  chil  dren  were  taught  to  say  these  six  words  from  their  infancy?  The  disunity  of  our  people  might  dissipate  under  the  influ  ence  of  the  unity  of  the  Shema.   The  potential  of  this  seemingly  simple  effort  may  be  learnt  from  what  has  been  termed  the  “butterfly  effect”.  At  the  December  1972  meeting  of  the  American  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science  in  Washing  ton,  the  world  was  sent  abuzz  when  Edward  Lorenz  presented  a  paper  entitled,  “Predictability:  does  the  flap  of  a  butterfly’s  wings  in  Brazil  set  off  a   Tornado  in  Texas?”.   He  concluded  that  slight  differ  ences  in  one  variable  had  profound  effects  on  the  outcome  of  the  world  wide  ecological  system.  If  a  tiny  but  terfly  can  impact  weather  conditions  around  the  world,  the  possibilities  for  changing  the  status  quo  in  Jewish   affiliation  are  endless.   In  Pirkei  Avot,  Ethics  of  the  Fathers,  we  find  the  concept  of  “mitzvah  gor  eret  mitzvah”,  meaning  that  one  good  deed  leads  to  another.  The  outcome  of  cumulative  good  deeds  could  theoreti  cally  be  enormous  and  yet  remain  unknown  to  the  initial  do-gooder.   If  readers  took  this  challenge  to  heart,  who  knows  what  the  “butterfly  effect”  of  little  children  reciting  the  Shema  would  be  on  Jews  around  the  world.  Perhaps  it  would  set  off  a  “tor  nado”  of  Jewish  spirituality  and  rejuvenation.   JTA   George  D  Hanus  is  the  chairman  of  the   Jewish  Broadcasting  Network  and  the   World  Jewish  Digest,  not-for-profit  organisations  dedicated  to  educating  the   community  about  issues  confronting   Israel  and  world  Jewry.

"  TROTSKY,  FREUD,  EINSTEIN,  CHOMSKY,  WOODY  AND  BETTE:   Embarrassed  Jewish  individuals   BEYOND  WORDS   RUTH  WAJNRYB   QUESTION:  what  do  Trotsky,   Freud,  Einstein,  Woody  Allen,  Noam  Chomsky  and  Bette   Midler  all  have  in  common?   Answer:  they’re  all  of  them  non  observant  secular  Jews.   According  to  anthropologist  Ivan  Kalmar,  they7re  also  Jews  who’d  rather  not  be  identified  as  Jews.  At  best,  they’re  “ish”  in  their  Jewishness.  They’re  what  Kalmar  calls  EJIs  (embarrassed  Jewish  individuals),  pro  nounced  “edgy”.  Kalmar’s  thesis  is  that  such  Jews  are  nervously  edgy  about  their  identity,  they  long  for  social  closeness  with  the  non-Jewish  world,  are  anxious  to  blend  in  and  keen  not  to  be  identified  as  Jewish.   Sound  familiar?   It’s  an  interesting  thesis,  both  com  pelling  and  provocative.  Kalmar’s  book  is  called  The  Trotskys,  Freuds  and  Woody  Allens:  Portrait  of  a  culture.  He  is  a  Jewish-Canadian  anthropologist,  whose  research  used  to  be  about  the  Inuit  of  Artie  Canada  until  he  realised  that  his  curiosity  about  foreign  cul  tures  was  due  mainly  to  his  inability  to   come  to  terms  with  his  own.  A  cir   cuitous,  though  far  from  infrequent,  path  to  the  contemplation  of  self.   Exploring  the  areas  of  endeavour  where  EJIs  have  excelled,  Kalmar  argues  that  Jewish  achievement  is  remarkably  selective.  He  asks:  why  is  it  that,  academically,  Jews  have  excelled  in  sociology,  anthropology,  linguistics,  psychology,  physics  and  genetics  but  not,  for  example,  in  zoology?  His  point  -  engaging  if  somewhat  exaggerated  -  is  that  EJIs  are  drawn  to  fields  of  inquiry  that  emphasise  “the  relations  between  things”  rather  than  those  that  emphasise  individuality  or  particulari  ty.  It’s  an  orientation  towards  univer  salism  and  abstraction,  a  seeking  of   Kalmar  calls  it  “the  Shylock  defence”,   referring  to  the  famous   speech  in  The  Merchant  of  Venice,  which   highlights  the  Jew's   essential  sameness  and  humanity.   □Is:  (from  left)  Woody  Allen,  Sigmund  Freud  and  Albert  Einstein.   evidence  of  similarity  rather  than  a  focus  on  the  distinctiveness  of  particu  lar  phenomena.   To  illustrate,  Kalmar  explores  Jew  ish  contributions  to  the  natural  sci  ences,  cultural  and  physical  anthropology,  archaeology,  sociology,  language,  psychoanalysis,  the  visual,  verbal  and  performing  arts  as  well  as  music.  Of  these,  the  only  discipline  in  which  I  feel  competent  to  assess  the  argument  is  language,  and  here  I  have  to  say,  Kalmar’s  point  is  well  made.  With  some  embarrassment,  I  gazed  in   his  mirror.   Kalmar  argues  that  language  as  a  subject  is  spread  across  two  areas  -  specific  language  departments  (e.g.  French)  and  linguistics  departments,  where  language  is  studied  in  the  abstract,  “as  the  common  heritage  of  humanity”.   Kalmar  (rightly)  claims  that  specif  ic-language  linguists  tend  to  be  non  Jewish,  while  Jews  are  disproportionately  represented  in  more  generalist  linguistics  studies.   The  pull  towards  generalist  studies,  Kalmar  contends,  is  bom  of  a  yearning  to  be,  and  be  perceived  as,  “the  same  as  everyone  else”,  an  extension  of  an  inner  discomfort  with  the  very  partic  ular  particularity  of  being  Jewish.  He   calls  it  “the  Shylock  defence”,  referring  to  the  famous  speech  in  The  Merchant  of  Venice,  which  highlights  the  Jew’s  essential  sameness  and  humanity;   Hath  not  a  Jew  eyes?  Hath  not  a  Jew  hands,  organs,  dimensions,  senses,  affec  tions,  passions,  fed  with  the  same  food,  hurt  with  the  same  weapons,  subject  to  the  same  diseases,  healed  by  the  same  means,  warmed  and  cooled  by  the  same  winter  and  summer,  as  a  Christian  is?  If  you  prick  us,  do  we  not  bleed?  If  you  tickle  us  do  we  not  laugh?  If  you  poison  us,  do  we  not  die?   Three  distinctive  features  of  EJIs’  discourse  style  are  identified.  The  first  is  “example  talk”.  The  EJIs  believe  that  they  shouldn’t  talk  too  loudly  about  Jewish  matters,  and  when  they  do,  it  is  simply  as  an  example  of  something  human.  If  an  EJI  gives  money  to  help  a  Jew  in  need,  he  likes  to  think  he’s  doing  it  as  a  humanitarian  gesture,  not  as  one  Jew  to  another.   Secondly,  EJIs  tend  to  generalise  from  the  Jewish  experience  but  with  out  acknowledging  the  Jewish  origins  of  their  thought.  He  cites  Freud:  “Whom  but  the  Jews  could  Freud  have  had  in  mind  as  the  ‘outsiders’  when  he  claimed  that  for  emotional  together  ness  people  had  to  have  cultural  out  siders  to  hate?”  And  Durkheim,  whose   father  was  a  rabbi  and  whose  theory  about  the  separation  of  the  sacred  and  the  profane  “comes  from  the  very  heart  of  Jewish  practice”.   The  third  feature  is  “funny-Jew  talk”.  If  “example  talk”  commands  EJIs  not  to  talk  openly  about  Jews,  then  funny-Jew  talk  allows  them  to  do  so,  brazenly  but  not  earnestly.  It’s  a  dis  arming  strategy,  the  way  fatso  and  baldy  jokes  are  told  by  fatties  and  baldies  -  upfront  and  in  advance.  It  partly  explains  the  number  of  Jewish   comics.   Every  book  has  its  text  but  also  its  paratexts  -  the  bits  around  the  main  text  -  which  can  be  revealing.  I  note  that  Kalmar  dedicates  his  work  to  the  memory  of  his  grandparents,  “and  hundreds  of  others”,  buried  in  a  mass  grave  in  Slovakia  “under  three  giant  crosses  and  nothing  to  tell  the  world  that  most  of  them  were  Jews”.   Perhaps  even  more  telling  is  the  quotation  that  prefaces  the  book.  From  Tom  Stoppard’s  The  Real  Thing,  it  reads,  “Public  postures  have  the  con  figuration  of  private  derangement”   Dr  Ruth  Wajnryb  is  an  applied  linguist  and  a  columnist  for  the  Sydney  Morning   Herald’s  weekend  edition.

"  The  highs  and  lows  of  Jewish  life  in  Spain   SICHAT  YOSEF   YOSSI  ARON   Though  communities  of  crypto-Jews   continued  to  exist  in  Spain  (and  its   overseas  territories)  throughout  the   centuries,  that  edict  of  expulsion  was  not  formally  rescinded  until  1968.   AST  week’s  horrific  bombings  in   Madrid  directed  world  atten   tion  towards  Spain.  Whatever  the  purported  reason  for  the   bombings,  which  if  not  related  to  internal  Spanish  affairs  may  involve  radical  Islamist  reaction  to  Spain’s  involvement  in  Iraq  or  a  general  antipathy  among  Islamic  terrorists  to  the  West,  Spain  has  long  been  a  cross  roads  between  Islam  and  Christianity.   The  nature  of  their  relationship   has  varied  from  one  of  coexistence  to   one  of  outright  hatred  -  with  intoler  ance  at  different  times  characterising   both  sides  of  the  conflict.  And  as  is   the  way  of  many  cultural  conflicts,  Jews  have  always  found  themselves  falling  somewhere  in  between  the  sparring  powers.   Ask  any  Jew  about  Spain  and  the  first  things  that  will  come  to  mind  will  be  the  Spanish  Inquisition  and  subsequent  expulsion.  But  while  Jew   ish  involvement  there  has  been  mini   mal  since  1492  -  only  really  developing  again  in  the  20th  century  -  there  is  much  more  to  the  Jews’  relationship  with  Spain.   Its  significance  is  emphasised  by  the  fact  that  the  most  common  ways  of  defining  Jews  into  different  group  ings  based  on  custom  and  heritage  is  Ashkenazi  and  Sephardi.  These  terms  originally  referred  to  the  two  differ   ent  communities  on  either  side  of  the   Pyrenees.  Ashkenazim  -  now  the  term  commonly  used  for  those  of  European  origin  -  referred  to  those  in  the  Crusader  lands  of  the  Rhine   Valley.  Sephardim  mean  those  of  the  Iberian  Peninsula  (Sepharad  is  Hebrew  for  Spain).   That  the  term  Sephardim  was  then  popularly  used  for  all  those  Jews  across  North  Africa  and  beyond   The  Interior  of  the  Toledo  synagogue  founded  In  1203...  now  a  church  known  as   Santa  Maria  la  Blanca.  Photo:  Isranet   (including  Egypt,  the  Levant  and  Mesopotamia),  reflected  the  connec  tion  between  those  Jews  of  Spain  and  those  of  Africa  and  the  Levant.  This   connection  was  facilitated  by  the  fact  that  those  lands  were  part  of  the   Islamic  world  -  which  for  centuries   was  less  negative  to  Jewish  life  than  countries  ruled  by  Christianity,  espe  cially  those  under  Catholic  control.   The  first  Jews  settled  in  Spain  dur  ing  the  heyday  of  the  Roman  Empire.  However  the  weakening  of  the  empire  and  the  subsequent  sixth-century  conversion  to  Christianity  of  Spain’s  rulers  sparked  an  era  of  persecution.  As  early  as  613  CE  (over  800  years  prior  to  the  expulsion)  Jews  were  ordered  to  convert  or  leave  Spain.  Many  adopted  the  position  better   known  from  the  time  of  the  Marra   nos  -  public  conversion  while  private  ly  maintaining  the  Jewish  faith.  And  it  was  such  conversos  who  welcomed  the  Muslims  on  their  arrival  across  the  Straits  of  Gibraltar  in  711.   Under  the  Umayyad  rule,  which  commenced  in  755,  Jewish  culture  flourished  alongside  their  Arab  coun  terparts.  In  the  10  th  century  Cordoba   became  the  centre  of  both  Arab  and  Jewish  culture.  This  was  the  time  of  the  rise  to  prominence  of  court  physician  and  diplomat  Hasdai  ibn  Shaprut   However  in  the  12th  century  the  position  of  the  Jews  worsened  under   the  fanatical  Almohades  who  invad  ed  from  Morocco  -  and  there  was   even  a  preference  among  Jews  for  survival  in  the  Christian  portion  of  the  peninsula.   Nevertheless  by  the  13th  century  legislation  defined  the  position  of  the  Jews.  Given  certain  legal  rights  and  protection,  they  were  also  subject  to  controls  over  their  interrelationship   with  the  Christian  citizens.  Such  con  trols  aside,  Jewish  courtiers  rose  to  the  highest  positions,  maintaining  a  continuity  which  had  its  origin  in  the  position  of  Jews  under  Muslim  rulers  both  in  Spain  and  elsewhere.   The  friction  between  Jews  and  Christians  in  Spain  in  the  13th  century  is  exemplified  by  the  public  debate  on  religious  philosophy  which  led  Nach  manides  —  the  Ramban  —  to  flee  to  the  Holy  Land.  Nevertheless  the  same  era  saw  the  flowering  of  kabbalistic  literature  in  Spain  followed  in  about  1340  by  the  publication  in  Castile  of   the  Arba  Turim  -  the  basis  of  the  Shulchan  Aruch  as  we  know  it  today.   However  by  the  end  of  the  14th  century  Christian  fanaticism  had  reasserted  itself  to  such  a  degree  that  many  were  forced  to  flee  or  convert.   It  was  such  conversos  who  set  the  scene  for  the  expulsion  less  than  a  century  later.  The  church  feared  that  the  existence  of  openly  proud  Jews  meant  that  the  conversos  would  never  truly  reconcile  themselves  to   their  Christian  status.   Though  communities  of  crypto  Jews  continued  to  exist  in  Spain  (and  its  overseas  territories)  throughout  the  centuries,  that  edict  of  expulsion  was  not  formally  rescinded  until  1968.  Nevertheless,  in  1924  Sephardi  Jews  living  abroad  had  been  granted  the  right  to  claim  Spanish  nationali  ty  -  which  provided  Spanish  author  ities  a  legal  basis  to  protect  Jews  fleeing  the  Nazi  persecutions  during   World  War  II.   Many  thousands  were  saved  through  the  utilisation  of  Spain  as  a  transit  point  or  remaining  in  Spain  and  its  colonial  territories  in  North  Africa.  Once  again  the  wheels  of  his  tory  had  turned  -  on  this  occasion  fortunately  in  our  favour.   Shabbat  shalom,  Yossi   Yossi  Aron  is  religious  aflairs   editor  of  the  AJN.

Jewish  Agency  treasurer  Shai  Her  mesh  revealed  the  details  of  the  plan,  scheduled  to  begin  in  September,  to  the  Australian  Jewish  News  this  week.   “There  are  100,000  Jewish  young  sters  around  the  world,”  he  said.  “Our  target  is  to  bring  20  per  cent  of  them  to   Israel.”   The  plan,  which  will  target  18-21  year-olds  in  the  Diaspora,  will  cost  $US200  million  per  annum.   Hermesh  said  the  Sharon  govern  ment  will  pay  25  per  cent  of  the  costs,  the  Jewish  Agency  25  per  cent  and  the  individual  paying  50  per  cent  -  about   $US5000.   In  the  best-case  scenario,  the  pro  gram  will  encourage  aliyah,  Hermesh  said.  In  the  worst-case  scenario  it  will   Jewish  Agency  treasurer  Shai  Hermesh.   bolster  the  Jewish  and  Zionist  roots  of  the  youth  in  the  Diaspora  -  especially  in  the  US,  where  two  out  of  every  three  Jews  are  assimilating,  he  said.   The  program  will  be  similar  to  the  Shnat  Hachshara  programs  run  by  Zionist  youth  movements:  it  will   indude  academic  studies,  community  and  sodal  work  and  kibbutz  experi  ence.  No  commitment  will  be  required  by  participants  after  the  year  in  Israel.   The  Jewish  Agency  aims  to  attract  4000  youth  this  year  and  to  increase  this  to  20,000  by  2008.  It  then  aims  to  perpetuate  that  number  on  an  annual   basis.   Hermesh  and  senior  consultant   Yigal  Sela  are  on  a  tour  of  Hong  Kong,   New  Zealand  and  Australia  to  meet   Jewish  Agency  shlichim  and  commu  nity  leaders.  Hermesh  is  scheduled  to   address  the  Zionist  Federation  of  Aus  tralia’s  biennial  conference  at  Hakoah  Club  on  Saturday  night.   He  said  the  plan  requires  massive  funding  by  Diaspora  Jewry,  but  stressed  that  Australian  Jewry  donates  per  capita  the  most  in  the  Diaspora.  In  absolute  terms  it  donates  the  second  most  -  more  than  $US20  million  -  after  the  US.   Hermesh  also  signalled  a  policy   shift  by  the  Jewish  Agency  from  “aliyah  of  rescue”  to  “aliyah  of  choice”.   Following  the  migration  to  Israel  of  one  million  Soviet  Jews  in  the  1990s,  there  is  a  negligible  number  of  Jews  left  to  rescue.  Hence,  the  agency  has  iden  tified  post-university  students  in  West  ern  countries  as  those  most  likely  to   succeed  in  Israel   It  is  looking  at  the  initiative  of  a  US  entrepreneur  who  is  offering  a  $US3000  per  person  down-payment  to  pay  off  university  debts  and  move  to  IsraeL  Previously,  the  agency  offered  incentives  for  absorption  in  Israel  only.   The  agency’s  plans  to  boost  aliyah   are  based  on  the  increase  in  assimila  tion  in  the  Diaspora  and  the  demo  graphic  time-bomb  facing  IsraeL   Hermesh  said  10  million  people  live  between  the  Jordan  River  and  the  Mediterranean  Sea,  of  whom  “50  per  cent  are  Jews.  If  you  take  only  Israel  on  pre-1967  borders,  72  per  cent  are  Jews”.   The  birth  rate  of  Jews  in  Israel  is  ris   ing  by  1-1.2  per  cent  annually,  but  the   birth  rate  of  Palestinians  in  Gaza  is  ris   ing  by  five  per  cent  The  birth  rate  of  Bedouin  in  the  Negev  and  Israeli  Arabs  in  the  Galilee  is  also  rising  faster  than  the  Jewish  birth  rate,  he  said.   “You  don’t  have  to  be  a  Ph.D  to   understand  that  aliyah  is  a  critical  need  to  promise  Israel  as  a  homeland  of  the  Jews  for  next  generations.  We  have  to  promise  our  children  a  country  that  will  be  based  on  three  values”  -  a  Jew  ish,  Zionist  and  democratic  state.   Jewish  Agency  treasurer  Shai  Hermesh  will   address  the  Zionist  Federation  of  Australia   conference  at  Hakoah  Club  on  Saturday  night  A  panel  will  discuss  “The  Middle  East—Do  the  media  understand  Israel?”,   featuring  Sky  News  presenter  John  Gatfield,  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Aflairs  Council  analyst  Ted  Lapkin  and  Haaretz  Asia-Pacific  correspondent  Chemi  Shalev.

"  The  philosopher,  the  Jewish   State,  its  democracy  and  the  future   In  Australia  to  deliver  the  annual  Pratt  Oration,  Professor  Moshe  Halbertal,  one  of  the  world’s  great  Jewish  philosophers,   spoke  with  the  Darsheini  team  about  Jewish  identity  and  the   religious  character  of  the  State  of  Israel.   ""Great  Jewish  ideas   come  from  the  meeting  of  Judaism  with  general  culture,  general   philosophy  and  we   need  to  recreate  that  meeting”   PROFESSOR  MOSHE  HALBERTAL   “I  don’t  advocate  a  full  separation  of  religion  and  state  in  the   American  model.  I  think  this  doesn’t  suit  the   Israeli  condition.  But  I  advocate  religious   pluralism,  from  the  point  I  of  view  of  the  state.”   PROFESSOR  MOSHE  HALBERTAL   MOSHE  Halbertal,  one   of  the  greatest  living  Jewish  philosophers  in  the  world,  likes  to  windsurf.  At  first  this  seems  surprising.  After  all,  to  be  a  master  of  the  Talmud  and  an  expert  in  medieval  Jewish  thought,  as  well  as  a  lecturer  in  western  political  philoso  phy  and  legal  interpretation  at  Har  vard  and  New  York  law  schools,  wouldn’t  leave  much  time  for  wind  surfing.   But  then  it  makes  perfect  sense.  Halbertal  likes  to  glide.  Windsurfing  is  not  only  a  hobby  that  this  lanky  philosopher  pursues  when  lifting  his  head  from  the  books.  Windsurfing  is  the  way  he  interprets  philosophy  and,  more  importantly,  the  way  he  views  Jewish  life.   Philosophy,  like  Jewishness,  is  not  a  stable  way  of  being  but  a  passage  through  rapid  ideas;  Jewishness,  like  philosophy,  should  not  protect  you  from  your  surroundings  but  expose  you  to  the  cultural  milieu  in  which  you  live,  he  says.   “The  thing  which  is  important  is  to  open  up,”  he  explains,  which  is  not  only  an  instruction  for  windsurfing  but  a  conviction  about  the  relationship  between  Jewish  and  western  cultures.   “Great  Jewish  ideas  come  from  the  meeting  of  Judaism  with  general  cul  ture,  general  philosophy,  and  we  need  to  recreate  that  meeting.”   Zionism  has  succeeded  and  the  Holocaust  is  both  a  trauma  and  a  les   son,  but  neither  can  form  the  ground  of  Jewish  identity  today,  he  says.   So  what  can?  “What  we’re  going  to  see  is  more  people  searching  their  Jewishness  within  the  Jewish  past,  try  ing  to  form  other  forms  of  identity.”   But  this  search  through  the  Jewish  past  is  not  what  goes  by  the  name  ba’al  t’eshuva,  so-called  returnees  to  the  faith,  Halbertal  says.   So,  according  to  Halbertal,  search  ing  the  Jewish  past  does  not  mean  opting  out  of  modem  culture  or  rejecting  western  tradition,  and  it  does  not  mean  finding  a  ready-made  “authentic  Judaism”  with  all  the  bear  ings  of  Jewishness  already  in  place.   MOSHE  Halbertal  was  bom  in   Uruguay  to  a  father  who  sur   vived  the  Holocaust  and  a  mother  who  came  to  teach  Hebrew   from  Jerusalem.  He  grew  up  in  Israel  in  a  modern  Orthodox  family  with  deep  Chassidic  roots.  And  yet,  after  several  years  at  the  very  top  of  the  stu   dent  hierarchies  in  the  best  modem   Orthodox  yeshiva  of  Gush  Emunim,   Halbertal  realised  it  was  time  to  set  sail.   “Creativity  comes  at  that  point  when  you  have  to  interpret  yourself  in  light  of  what’s  around,”  suggests  the  professor  of  Jewish  thought  and  phi  losophy  at  the  Hebrew  University  of  Jerusalem  and  fellow  of  the  Hartman  Institute.   “That’s  what  I  think  distinguishes  between  the  so-called  ultra-Orthodox   point  of  view  and  a  modem  Ortho  dox  or  modem  approach  -  that  tradi  tion  doesn’t  monopolise  all  of  value,  all  of  truth.”   A  modem  approach  to  Jewish  identity,  argues  Halbertal,  is  secure   Professor  Moshe  Halbertal  delivering  the  Pratt  Oration  earlier  this  month:  “I  think  it  will  be  good  both  for  halacha  and  the  state  that  religious  forces  should  not  employ  the  coercive  machinery  of  the  state  to  enforce  their  agenda.”   Photo:  Michael  Silver/Photonet   enough  to  learn  from  western  values  and  to  integrate  them  into  new  forms  of  Jewishness.  Some  will  object  that  openness  to  external  truths  and  val  ues  undermines  the  “authenticity”  of  Judaism.   “Authenticity  is  an  inauthentic  cat  egory,”  quips  the  philosopher.  “Authenticity  is  a  projection  back   ward  to  a  condition  that  was  never   there.  After  all,  [the  great  Jewish  his  torian]  Jacob  Katz  was  right,  that  Orthodoxy  is  a  modem  movement.  And  what  we  see  is  kind  of  projecting  200  years  of  Ashkenazi  ghetto  life   backward  to  describe  what  is  ‘authen   tic’.  This  is  a  process  we  could  call  the  invention  of  authenticity.  This  is  a  survival  mechanism,  it’s  a  way  of  sur  viving  by  protecting  yourself  from  the  world.  But  most  Jews  are  exposed  to   the  world  whether  we  like  it  or  not.  And  it’s  a  survival  mechanism  which  pays  an  enormous  price,  the  price  is  the  great  impoverishment  of  the  tra  dition  itself  by  building  a  very  narrow  conception  of  authenticity.”   So  Judaism  has  to  be  open  to  out  side  influence,  first  because  it  always  has  been,  and  second  because  that  is  how  it  maintains  its  creative  life  force.   “We  have  to  say,  OK  let’s  not  establish  Jewish  identity  out  of  fear  of  outside  influence  because  there  is  a  very  seri  ous  Jewish  tradition  that  tries  to  use  those  ideas  as  a  creative  force.  And  I   think  there  are  the  very  beginnings  of  interesting  things  going  in  that  direc  tion  at  the  moment  in  the  Jewish  world;  it’s  still  unshaped,  it’s  exciting  because  it’s  completely  open  ended,  we  don’t  know  what’s  going  to  hap  pen  with  that  interaction.”   Likewise  in  Israel,  opportunities  present  themselves  for  a  radical  engagement  of  Jewishness  with  national  sovereignty  and  democracy,  even  if  they  are  thwarted  by  the  poli   tics  of  coercion.   “What  does  it  mean  ‘halacha’  in  a  sovereign  Jewish  state?  Do  we  have  any  idea  of  the  social  policies  of  halacha?  You  feel  like  the  Mishnah  has  to  be  rewritten,  all  seder  nezikin,  the  laws  dealing  with  damages,  have  to  be  rewritten  in  a  serious  way.  Because  it’s  a  completely  new  condition.  Do  we  have  any  understanding  what  does  it  mean  to  run  a  Jewish  hospital,  a  Jew  ish  prison?  Meanwhile  halachists  in  Israel  have  been  in  the  traditional  business  of  mashgikei  kashrut,  of  supervising  the  production  of  kosher  food,  but  there’s  a  whole  field  that  is  still  completely  open.”   ALBERTAL  belongs  to  that  small  sector  of  Israeli  religious  Jews  who  believe  that  the  reli  gious  establishment  should  have  less  power  to  enforce  its  views  on  the  citi   zens  of  Israel.  He  is  an  associate  and  adviser  to  leaders  of  the  Meimad   Party,  allied  to  the  Labour  Party  in  the  current  Knesset,  which  advocates,  precisely  in  the  interest  of  religious  Judaism,  religious  pluralism  and  a  Jewish  and  democratic  State  of  Israel.   “We  are  establishing  a  home  where  different  kinds  of  Jews  will  feel  at  home  in  Israel  and  not  just  some  Jews;  also  its  non-Jewish  citizens  should  feel  at  home.  It’s  a  real  challenge.”   But  Halbertal  is  not  simply  a  liber  al  who  wants  to  entirely  separate  reli  gion  and  politics  and  retreat  to  the   idea  of  a  neutral  state  with  no  cultur   al  or  religious  identity.   “Separation  is  too  strong  a  term.  I  would  say  that  the  United  States  model  isn’t  right  because  I  think,  for  example,  that  the  state  ought  to  finance  and  subsidise  religious  educa  tion,  it  ought  to  finance  synagogues  and  mikvahs,  but  not  only  one  type  of  synagogue.  It  ought  to  finance  Jewish  cultures,  not  Jewish  culture.  From  the  point  of  view  of  the  state,  if  there  is  a  communal  need  or  request  for  a  Con  servative  or  Reform  synagogue,  the  state  should  not  be  the  one  to  adjudi  cate  what  is  authentic  Judaism.  If  Israel  wants  to  be  the  state  for  the  Jews,  it  cannot  be  a  fully  Jewish  state,  because  Jews  do  not  agree  about  what  Jewishness  is.  And  I  think  the  Knesset,  with  all  due  respect,  doesn’t  have  any  authority  to  decide  what  is  genuine  halacha.  So  I  don’t  advocate  a  full  sep  aration  of  religion  and  state  in  the   American  model.  I  think  this  doesn’t  suit  the  Israeli  condition.  But  I  advo  cate  religious  pluralism,  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  state.”   DEMOCRACY  is  fundamental   to  this  political  philosopher.  In   fact  it  is  the  democratic  charac  ter  of  the  State  of  Israel  that  elicits  the  most  praise  from  Halbertal.  “Democ  racy  is  a  non-violent  form  of  adjudi  cating  different  ideologies.  It’s  very  easy  to  be  non-violent  when  stakes  are  low;  in  Israel  we  are  in  a  condition  where  the  stakes  are  very  high.  It’s  a  tribute  to  Israel  that  it  has  managed  to  maintain  democracy  under  such  con  ditions  of  diversity  and  high  political   stakes.  I  would  like  to  see  other  west  ern  states  deal  with  this  condition   without  becoming  fascistic.”   Halbertal’s  views  on  politics  and  religion  invert  the  common  logic  that  ties  religious  and  political  claims.  “In  general,  the  role  of  religion  in  the  region  is  to  absolutise  relative  political  claims,  by  which  I  mean  that  what  happens  in  politics  is  that  we  have  legitimate  conflicts  over  water,  bor  ders  etc.,  and  then  the  religious  claim,  the  realm  of  the  sacred,  is  brought  in  to  make  those  claims  absolute,  because  the  sacred  is  indivisible.  What   are  the  settlers  saying?  That  there  are  issues  that  the  sovereign  state  can  decide,  and  there  are  issues  that  are  not  up  for  negotiation,  and  the  other   side  does  the  same.”   Whereas  for  Halbertal  -  and  here   his  politics  are  most  clearly  informed  by  a  tradition  of  Jewish  philosophy  -  the  role  of  religion  in  politics  is  pre  cisely  “to  make  absolute  claims  rela  tive”,  which  means  insisting  that  the  only  thing  that  is  absolute,  holy  and  indivisible  is  God.  A  religious  and  political  philosophy,  then,  which  overturns  the  logic  of  religious  settle  ments  -  though  Halbertal  doesn’t  hesitate  to  call  himself  a  Zionist.   “The  logic  of‘if  it  is  holy  to  me  it  is  mine’  must  be  rejected;  it  runs  against  the  very  idea  of  holiness.  The  holy  is  the  unpossessed.”   Darsheini  -  run  by  Melanie  Landau,  Dr  Nathan  Wolski,  Dr  Michael  Fagenblat   and  Merav  Carmeli  -  is  the  community   learning  program  of  the  Australian   Centre  for  the  Study  of  Jewish  Civilisation,  Monash  University.

"  Jewish  communal  fundraising  was  strong  even  150  years  ago   SICHAT  YOSEF   YOSSIARON   It  seems  clear  that  Australian  Jewish  philanthropic   prominence,  especially  in  regard  to  communal  facilities,  has  a  long  history.   THIS  month  the  Age  marked  the   150th  anniversary  of  its  estab  lishment  by  publishing  a  fac  simile  copy  of  its  first  edition  which  featured  an  article  headed  “Religious   statistics”   There  were  50  clergy  at  the  helm  of  the  Church  of  England,  42  Presby  terians,  26  Catholics,  a  host  of  repre   sentatives  of  smaller  denominations  and  one  Jewish  minister.   He  was  Rev  Moses  Rintel,  the  teacher,  shochet,  mohel  and  reader  appointed  to  Melbourne  Hebrew  Congregation  in  1849.   Similarly  under  the  heading  “Places  of  worship”,  the  Church  of  England  was  found  to  have  11  churches  plus  41  temporary  locations  (presumably  mainly  on  the  gold  fields),  the  Wesleyans  had  even  more,  the  Catholics  had  18,  but  the  Jews  had  just  one.  This  would  have  been  the  original  home  of  Melbourne  Hebrew  Congregation,  then  located   in  Bourke  Street   But  the  biggest  surprise  was  to  be  found  under  “voluntary  contribu  tions”.  A  table  of  the  funds  raised  by  congregations  during  the  last  year  which  indicated  “the  activity  which  all  have  displayed  in  providing  for  the  extension  of  religious  institutions”.   These  figures  were  quite  surpris  ing.  The  total  for  the  Church  of  Eng  land  was  £24,000,  Wesleyans  raised  £30,000,  Presbyterians  £32,000  and  the  Jews  raised  £9000.   The  surprise  arises  from  the  fact  that  the  total  Victorian  (white)  popu  lation,  according  to  the  census  of  1851,  was  just  over  77,000  of  which  only  600  were  stated  to  be  Jews.   While  by  1854  the  population  was  believed  to  have  quadrupled  to  280,000,  even  if  there  had  been  a  dis  proportionate  increase  in  the  num  ber  of  Jews,  they  still  comprised  only  a  tiny  percentage  of  the  total.   Yet  the  amount  they  had  collected  for  what  was  actually  the  rebuilding   of  the  overcrowded  Bourke  Street  premises  was  a  substantially  more  sig  nificant  amount  per  head  than  char  acterised  the  rest  of  the  population.   It  seems  clear  that  Australian  Jew  ish  philanthropic  prominence,  espe  cially  in  regard  to  communal  facilities,  has  a  long  history.   A  further  issue  which  appears  in   that  article  is  that  of  state  aid.  Refer   ence  is  made  to  amounts  of  money  which  were  voted  by  the  Legislative   Council  for  distribution  to  the  vari  ous  Christian  denominations.   While  we  are  used  to  referring  to  state  aid  in  the  context  of  money  made  available  to  the  mainly  denom  inational  private  schools,  in  those  early  days  the  term  had  a  much   broader  connotation.   A  British  parliamentary  act  of  1836  empowered  the  provision  of  assistance  for  ministers  of  religion  and  for  building  houses  of  Christian  worship.   These  provisions  incorporated  in  New  South  Wales  legislation  in  1842  referred  to  public  worship  -  without  including  the  word  “Christian”.   Although  the  Sydney  Jewish  com  munity  received  £1000  to  liquidate  the  debt  on  their  synagogue,  secre  tary  of  state  Earl  Grey  said  that  he  regretted  the  proposal.   However,  when  Melbourne  Hebrew  Congregation  sought  £500  in  1850  towards  its  first  synagogue,  the  request  was  refused  on  the  basis  of  Earl  Grey’s  view,  despite  the  fact  that  public  opinion  and  the  press  were  in  favour  of  equal  treatment  for  Jews.   Interestingly  even  some  of  the  opposition  in  parliament  to  that  pro  vision  of  aid  was  not  specifically  directed  at  Jews  per  se.   In  an  indication  of  contemporary  prejudice  it  was  said  that  the  objec  tion  was  based  more  on  precedent  for  applications  by  “Hindus,  Moham   metans  and  socialists”.   In  a  colony  where  sentiment  was  more  liberal  than  that  in  England,  state  aid  became  a  major  issue  in  the  Victorian  Legislative  Assembly  elec   tion  of  1856.   Initially  grants  to  Jews  were  stymied  by  the  conservative  Legisla  tive  Council.  Finally  from  1859  a  sum  of  £2000  per  annum  was  provided  for  the  “Victorian  Jewish  Communi  ty”.  Funding  continued  until  1870,  when  denominational  grants  were  phased  out.   Similarly  fundings  to  religious  organisations  for  the  operation  of  educational  institutions  ceased  from  1873  as  a  result  of  the  passing  of  the  “free  compulsory  and  secular”  Educa   tion  Act  Under  that  act  all  denomina   tional  schools  (including  Melbourne’s  19th-century  Jewish  dayschool),  ceased  to  receive  any  state  aid.   All  schools  had  to  fund  themselves  or  go  out  of  operation  -  a  situation  which  applied  until  the  reintroduction  of  state  aid  at  federal  level  in  the  1960s.   It  is  noteworthy  that  although  the  Jewish  school  in  Ballarat  dosed,  Mel  bourne  Hebrew  School,  associated  with  Melbourne  Hebrew  Congrega  tion,  continued  to  operate  in  various  guises  until  1895.   It  closed  in  that  year  in  the  context  of  a  serious  economic  depression  which  affected  many  communal  fam  ilies  making  them  unable  to  pay  fees.   Following  its  closure,  the  three  main  congregations  (Melbourne,  East  Melbourne  and  St  Kilda)  united  to  form  the  United  Jewish  Education  Board  to  provide  part-time  educa  tion  -  a  function  that  it  (like  Sydney’s  Academy  BJE)  still  carries  out  today  when  once  again  so  many  cannot  afford  school  fees  despite  today’s  lev   els  of  state  aid.

"  Jews  and  organ  donation   What  is  the  Jewish  view  of  organ  donation?   JEWISH  law  distinguishes   between  organ  donation  during  your  lifetime  and  organ  donation  after  death.  While  you  are  alive,  to  donate  an  organ  that  you  can  live   without  in  order  to  save  another  life  is   one  of  the  greatest  acts  you  could  do.   However,  consenting  to  have  your  organs  removed  after  death  presents  some  heavy  problems.   The  body  doesn’t  belong  to  us  but  to  God.  He  put  it  in  our  hands  for  safekeeping  as  long  as  we  are   alive.  We  are  to  use  our  bodies  for   good  purposes  and  treat  them  with  respect.  So  we  can  donate  an  organ  that  we  can  live  without,  because  then  we  are  using  our  body  for  a  holy  purpose.  But  as  soon  as  our  soul  leaves  our  body  we  have  no  “rights”  to  it  whatsoever.  We  have  to  return  it  to  its  rightful  owner.  It  is  forbidden  to  “use”  a  dead  body  for  anything  at  all.   The  only  exception  would  indeed  be  directly  to  save  a  specific  life,  because  saving  life  overrides  almost  every  other  Jewish  law.  But  when  you  sign  a  consent  form  to  have  your  organs  removed,  they  will  remove  them  whether  or  not  they  are  needed  for  an  immediate  trans   plant.  They  may  use  them  for  research,  or  they  may  store  them,  or  even  throw  them  out.  Unless  there  is   an  actual  person  who  immediately  needs  the  organ,  it  is  forbidden  to  tamper  with  a  corpse.   But  there  is  a  much  more  serious   problem.  To  be  usable  in  a  trans  plant,  the  organs  have  to  be   removed  while  the  heart  is  still  beat   ing.  But  the  Jewish  legal  definition  of  death  is  the  heart  stopping.  So  according  to  Jewish  law  the  medics  are  actually  killing  the  patient  if  they   remove  limbs  after  brain  death  but  before  absolute  death.   This  can  lead  to  even  more  shaky  ground.  Imagine  a  case  where  a  patient  is  “obviously”  going  to  die  according  to  the  doctors,  and  they  urgently  need  his  organs  for  some  one  else.  They  may  reason  that  they  may  as  well  take  them  now  rather  than  wait  for  the  event  to  happen  and  risk  losing  both  patients.  So  we  are  dealing  with  issues  bordering  on   murder.   There  are  some  countries  where  there  is  an  option  to  write  on  the  consent  form  that  you  only  agree  to  organs  being  removed  if  a  rabbi  is  consulted  beforehand,  who  will  ascertain  that  they  will  only  be   removed  after  absolute  death  and  be   used  only  to  save  lives.  In  Australia  there  is  no  such  option  as  yet.  So  presently  we  don’t  consent  to  the  removal  of  organs  after  death.

"  LYNCHING  OF  JEW  MARKED   ATLANTA  -  Jews  in  Atlanta,  Georgia,  marked  the  90th  anniversary  of  the  lynching  of  a  Jewish  man.  The  com  memorations  last  week  marked  the   date  when  Leo  Frank  was  lynched  by  a  mob  after  being  wrongly  convicted  of  killing  a  teenage  girl  in  a  pencil  fac  tory.  Frank  was  posthumously  par  doned  in  1986  on  the  grounds  that  the  state  failed  to  adequately  protect  him  while  he  was  in  custody.  The  lynching  led  to  the  formation  of  the  Anti-Defamation  League.   JTA ",2005-08-26

"  GRATIFYINGLY  JEWISH   I  HAD  the  pleasure  of  attending  the  Blues  Festival  in  the  Blue  Mountains  over  the  weekend,  where  an  eclectic  range  of  groups  performed  to  varying  degrees  of  applause  and  acclamation.   From  a  Jewish  perspective,  there  were  two  undoubted  highlights.  One  was  a  performance  by  a  band  called  The  Jews  Brothers,  who  had  the  audi   ence  cheering  and  whistling  to  such   tunes  as  Turn  Balalaika  and  a  hilarious  number  called  Mordechai,  What  A  Guy.  The  other  was  the  headline  act  by  internationally-acclaimed  singer  Janis  Ian  (from  the  Joan  Baez  era).  With  1000  people  hanging  onto  her  every  word,  she  told  the  audience  what  life  is  like  as  the  only  Jew  in  Nashville,  Ten  nessee,  how  she  regularly  has  to  deflect  attempts  to  baptise  her  and  how  proud  she  is  of  who  she  is.

"  Mandarin   spelling  of‘Jew’  challenged   U&amp;N  BLOOM   TAIPEI,  Taiwan  -  The  Chinese  lan  guage  comprises  thousands  of  char  acters  and  combinations  of   characters,  each  composed  of  various  strokes.  Now  a  human-rights  group  in  Taiwan  is  calling  on  Chinese  jour  nalists  and  academics  around  the   world  to  stop  the  “discriminatory”  way  that  the  characters  for  “Jewish  people”  are  written  in  Mandarin.   ‘The  combination  that  is   currently  being  used   refers  to  an  animal  of  the  monkey  species.”   CHIEN  HIS-CHIEH  Director,  Peacetime  Foundation  of  Taiwan   “There  are  many  Chinese  charac  ters  for  You-tai,  or  Jew,  but  the  com  bination  that  is  currently  being  used  refers  to  an  animal  of  the  monkey  species  and  has  the  connotation  of  stinginess,”  Chien  Hsi-chieh,  the  director  of  the  Peacetime  Foundation  of  Taiwan,  said.   Chien’s  remarks  at  a  news  confer  ence  in  Taipei,  complete  with  illustra  tions  of  the  offending  characters  and  the  new  characters  he  recommends,  were  widely  reported  in  Chinese-lan  guage  media  across  Taiwan  and  ^Shina.   Chien  said  the  biased  Chinese   characters  were  devised  by  Christian  missionaries  in  China  around  1830,  when  they  were  translating  the   Hebrew  and  Christian  Bibles  into  -^jihinese  and  needed  a  term  for  “Jews”.   Since  Taiwan  has  no  official  diplo  matic  ties  with  Israel  due  to  the  Jew  ish  state’s  “one  China”  policy,  there  have  been  no  contacts  with  Jerusalem  about  the  matter,  Chien  said,  but  he  atided  that  he  has  spoken  with  repre   sentatives  of  the  Israeli  trade  office  in   Taipei  on  several  occasions.

"  Big  Brother's  Jewish  question   OPEN  your  copy  of  the  Macquarie  Dictionary,  and  you  will  find  the  fol   lowing  alternative  definition  for  the  word  “Jew”:  “Colloquial  (deroga  tory)  a  usurer;  miser;  one  who  drives  a  hard  bargain.”   Until  the  mid-1950s,  the  most  pre-eminent  dictionary  of  the  English  lan  guage,  the  Oxford  English  Dictionary,  refused  to  even  display  the  cautionary  words  “derogatory”  or  “offensive”,  defining  the  adjective  “Jew”  as  “applied  to  an  extortionate  usurer,  or  a  trader  who  drives  hard  bargains  or  deals  craftily”.   This  is  not  to  belittle  the  gravity  of  the  incident  that  occurred  on  this  week’s  episode  of  the  hit  reality  TV  show  Big  Brother,  in  which  Army  Reserve  soldier  Nelson  called  the  program’s  moderator  “a  Jew”  for  refusing  to  provide  another  contestant  with  a  nose-ring.  On  the  contrary,  Nelson’s  remark  goes  to  prove  that  although  the  world  has  come  a  long  way  in  the  past  few  decades  in  eradicating  offensive  and  racist  epithets  from  daily  speech  and  consigning  them  to  learned  dictionaries,  it  apparently  hasn’t  come  far  enough.  It  stands  (  to  reason  that  among  Nelson’s  Queensland  mates,  or  perhaps  in  his  army  bar   racks,  the  term  “Jew”  is  still  used  regularly  in  its  offensive,  medieval  context.   Nonetheless,  the  affair  has  been  noted  and  reported  precisely  because  it  is  so  rare.  And  the  swift  and  resolute  reaction  by  Big  Brother  producers,  who  “punished”  Nelson  on  air,  as  well  as  the  immediate  denunciation  in  a  state  ment  issued  by  Network  Ten,  prove  that  resistance  to  antisemitism  and  racial  stereotyping  is  deeply  and  healthily  ingrained  in  much  of  Australian  society.   As  such,  rather  than  being  seen  as  another  example  of  festering  anti  semitism,  the  response  to  this  incident  should  be  viewed  by  the  Jewish  com  munity  as  encouraging.

"  A  JEWISH  POPE?   COULD  the  118  cardinal  electors  stun  the  world  by  choosing  Jewish  born  Cardinal  J  e  a  n  -  M  a  r  i  e  Lustiger  (pictured)  as  the  next  pope?   Lustiger’s  parents  died  in  Auschwitz,  and  he  has  always  insisted  that  he  remained  a  Jew  despite  con  verting  to  Christianity  at  the  age  of  14  to  escape  the  Nazis.   “I  was  born  a  Jew  and  so  I  am.  For  me,  the  vocation  of  Israel  is  to  bring  light  to  the  goyim.  That’s  my  hope,  and  I  believe  Christianity  is  the  means  for  achieving  it.”   He  had  himself  baptised  because  he  was  so  impressed  with  the  Catholi  cism  of  his  foster  parents,  who  brought  him  up  after  his  parents  had  been  deported  from  Paris  in  1940.  In  return,  Lustiger,  77,  has  made  it  his  mission  to  convert  France  and  by  extension  Europe.   France  was  stunned  when  Pope  John  Paul  II  named  Lustiger,  who  speaks  Yiddish,  as  archbishop  of  Paris  in  1981,  two  years  before  he  was  made  cardinal.  “You  are  the  fruit  of  the  Holy  Father’s  prayer,”  the  pon  tiffs  secretary  told  him.  Lustiger  has  since  retired  as  Archbishop  oif  Paris.   At  the  conclave  of  cardinals,  Lustiger  said  this  week  there  will  be  “no  journalists,  no  cell  phones,  no  radio,  no  telephones.

"  NO  JEWISH  QUESTION   YOSSI  Aron  (AJN  11/11)  raises  the  interesting  question  of  the  attitude,  if  any,  that  the  Jewish  community  took  30  years  ago,  following  the  dismissal,  as  Australia’s  Labour  candidate  opposed  the  “Zionism  equals  racism”  resolution.   The  fact  that  David  Smith  was  Jew  ish  was  of  no  great  significance.  Anti   semitism  was  not  an  issue  at  the  time   and  clearly  Middle  Eastern  affairs  were  not  of  major  concern.  Either  way,  Jews   voted  in  the  1975  election  on  local  concerns  in  this  matter.  No  Jewish   question  existed,  as  far  as  I  could  see!

Among  the  600  mourners  in  Canberra’s  St  Christopher’s  Cathe  dral  were  representatives  of  the  Aboriginal,  Islamic,  Chinese,  Span  ish,  Italian  and  Irish  communities,  a  Federal  and  Supreme  Court  judge,  a  Labor  senator  ...  and  Jewish  mem  bers  of  Grassby’s  family.   Seated  next  to  Elinor,  Grassby’s  wife  for  43  years,  was  Irit  Davis,  from  Sydney.  The  Jewish  connec  tion  was  the  result  of  the  marriage  of  Al’s  daughter  Gabriella  to  one  of  the  Davis  family.   The  Jews  and  others  with  a  Jew  ish  connection  among  the  principal  mourners  were  Sydney  residents  Michael  Davis,  Mandy  Hupperton,  former  wife  of  Lionel,  another  of  the  Davis  family,  and  Khedra  Davis,  Gabriella’s  son  and  Grassby’s  grandson.

"  JEWISH  SINGLES   ALISON  SHAMES   Dr  Love   SORE  arm  from  kayaking  brought  me  to  my  local   /  \  medical  centre  where  I  sat  down  in  a  small,  cramped  office  with  Dr  Bernie  Bernstein.  The  doc  tor  quickly  diagnosed  my  ailment  as  tendonitis  and  gave  me  free  sam  ples  of  a  strong  anti-inflammatory.   The  consultation  was  over  in  two  minutes,  but  Dr  Bernie  felt  chatty  and  asked  about  my  North  American  accent.  I  needed  to  get  to  work,  but  sitting  there  with  Dr  Bernie,  with  his  yarmulke,  bushy  beard,  and  Jewish  manner,  I  wanted  to  bond.  I  grew  up  near  New  York  City  surrounded  by  my  Jewish  fam  ily  and  friends  and,  after  several  years  of  my  own  diaspora  in  Australia  where  I  had  met  very  few  Jews,  I  missed  the  sense  of  humour,  warmth  and  language  of  the  Jewish  people.  Before  I  knew  it,  I  men  tioned  that  I  was  Jewish,  recently  divorced,  and  looking  for  a  nice  Jewish  boy.   In  America,  land  of  six  million  Jews,  the  ""member  of  the  tribe""  connection  doesn't  get  you  very  far.  In  Australia,  island  of  less  then  100,000  Jews,  this  was  ""stop  the  press""  news.  Dr  Bernie  turned  paternal  and  advised  me  to  put  my  professional  life  second  and  focus  on  finding  a  husband  and  starting  a  family.  He  rattled  off  religious  groups  that  I  should  join  to  meet  young  Jewish  men.  I  made  clear  that  I  was  non-religious,  and  had  no  interest  in  meeting  a  pious  boy.   Undeterred,  he  went  on  for  long  minutes  about  the  religious  Jewish  community  in  Sydney.   Interrupting  his  sermon,  I  polite  ly  murmured  something  about  get  ting  to  work,  and  made  my  exit.  As  I  paid  the  receptionist,  I  considered  grabbing  my  file  and  erasing  my  contact  information,  thinking  that  Dr  Bernie  might  be  an  evangelical  type,  looking  to  convert  wayward  Jews.  I  imagined  the  spam  that  would  arrive  from  Dr  Bernie  and  his  fellow  proselytizers.  I  brushed  the  thought  away,  left  my  file  intact  and   hurried  off  to  catch  the  bus.   Three  weeks  later,  my  phone  rings  at  work.  ""Hi  Alison,  it's  Dr  Bernie,  I  have  someone  here  who  wants  to  meet  you.""   ""Alison,  hi,  my  name  is  Jacob,  the  doctor  says  you're  looking  for  a  nice  Jewish  boy.""  I  am  speechless.  I  tell  Jacob  to  call  me  later  but  Dr  Bernie  gets  back  on  the  phone.  ""Alison,  what's  the  harm  in  meeting  him?  Jacob  will  come  into  the  city  and  meet  you  today.  Jacob,  what  time  will  you  be  there?""   I  politely  but  firmly  tell  Dr  Bernie  thank  you,  Jacob  should  ring  me  later,  and  hang  up  the  phone.  I  wondered  whether  Dr  Bernie  had  ever  heard  of  the  Privacy  Act  and  imagine  him  sharing  my  medical  file  with  random  Jewish  boys.  I  was  thankful  my  injury  was  to  my  arm  and  not  another  part  of  my  body.   My  mobile  phone  rings  two  min   utes  later.  ""Alison,  it's  Jacob.  I  just  left  Dr  Bernie's  office.  I  was  with  my  mother,  she's  always  trying  to  marry  me  off.""  Oh  no,  I  knew  I  should  have  taken  my  file,  why  did  this  thir  ty-something  bring  his  mother  to  his  medical  appointment?   ""Now,  Alison,  I  will  be  in  the  city  today.  How  about  I  meet  you   around  noon?""   I  wanted  to  say  no,  but  then  I  thought,  ""You  never  know""  (my  mother's  mantra  since  the  day  I  started  dating).  I  agreed  to  meet  for  him  for  coffee.   Dr  Bernie  turned  paternal   and  advised  me  to  put  my  professional  life  second  and  focus  on  finding  a  husband  and  starting  a  family.   As  noon  approached,  I  readied  myself  for  the  blind  date  let-down.  I  stereotyped  Jacob  as  a  religious  Jew  with  a  skullcap,  beard,  white  but  ton-down  shirt  and  black  chinos.  I  arrive  at  the  meeting  place  and  shake  hands  with  a  relatively  tall,  dark  and  handsome  guy.  He's  wear  ing  hip  clothes,  is  clean-shaven,  and  exhibits  no  outward  signs  of  a  reli  gious  life.  Hmmm,  still  wonder  why  he  was  at  the  doctor's  with  his  mother.   We  shared  a  pleasant  lunch,  but  sparks  did  not  fly  and  I  learned  he  spends  a  lot  of  time  with  his  moth  er.  We  parted  with  a  kiss  on  the  cheek  and  a  promise  to  be  in  touch.  I  was  indifferent  to  whether  he  rang  me,  but  I  walked  away  in  an  upbeat  mood.   I  had  considered  contacting  Dr  Bernie  and  demanding  that  he  keep  my  contact  details  private  as  required  under  law.  But  Dr  Bernie  was  as  considered  in  his  matchmak  ing  as  he  is  in  his  medical  practice:  he  diagnosed  the  patient  and  pre  scribed  appropriate  medicine.   I'll  give  Dr  Bernie's  matchmaking  service  another  try,  but  perhaps  I  should  ask  him  to  update  my  med  ical  history  to  include  an  allergy  to  men  who  bring  their  mother  along  to  doctor's  appointments.

Ian  Jankelowitz  presented  the  session,  which  examined  the  disproportionate  number  of  Jewish  contributors  to  the  porn  industry,  both  behind  the  scenes  and  on  camera.  Jankelowitz  described  the  phenomenon  as  ""either  freaky  or  exciting"".   An  early  porn-industry  pioneer,  Reuben  Sturman  began  distributing  adult  books  because  the  profits  were  about  20  times  what  he  could  make  on  other  books,  explained   Jankelowitz.

Although  Sturman  spent  the  end  of  his  life  in  jail  for  tax  evasion,  Jankelowitz  named  Adam  Glasser  -  aka  Seymour  Butts  -  as  a  con  temporary  Jewish  success  story.   ""If  I  was  going  to  name  every  Jewish  actor  in  the  porn  industry  it  would  probably  take  me  about  half  an  hour,""  he  said.

Because  his  initials  are  JWS,  they  lent  themselves  to  the  jocular  taunts  of  school  pals  at  Brentwood  School  in  Essex,  his  mother  has  revealed.   “He’s  also  always  looked  Jewish,”  she   said.   Joan  Ormston-Straw,  a  spritely  84  year  old  whose  paternal  grandfather  was  a  Ger  man  Jew,  spoke  about  her  Jewish  origins  to  the  UK's  Jewish  Telegraph  this  week.

"  Jewish  Vienna  seeks  immigrants   DINAH  A  SPRITZER   VIENNA  -  Give  us  your  tired,  your  poor,  your  Ukrainians.   Such  is  the  vision  of  Ariel  Muzi  cant,  president  of  Vienna’s  Jewish  community.  He  hopes  the  communi  ty’s  abundance  of  cultural,  educational  and  social  riches,  coupled  with  Aus  tria’s  healthy  economy,  will  become  a  magnet  for  thousands  of  Jews  living   further  east.   “We  have  the  best  infrastructure  of   any  Jewish  community  in  Europe.

"  ewish  ‘settlers’  in  Kathmandu   IT  is  said  that  only  when  the  ""well   springs  of  Judaism""  have  spread  to  every  corner  of  the  world  that  the  Moshiach  will  come.  And  under  the   guidance  of  the  late  Lubavitcher  Rebbe,  Chabad  Houses  have  sprung  up  in  many  far  reaches  of  the  globe.   In  the  western  tourist  district  of  Thamel  in  Kathmandu,  Nepal,  Chabad  House  is  one  of  the  many  ordinary  two-storey  houses  lining  a  narrow  street.  Thirty-year-old  Israeli  Rabbi  Yechezkel  Lifshitz  ruhs  the  house,  together  with  his  wife  Chani  -  who  has  a  sister  living  in  Melbourne  -  and  their  three  chil  dren,  who  are  all  under  six.   Chabad  aspires  to  provide  a  home  environment  for  the  tired  Jewish  backpacker  who  longs  to  meet  friends  and  be  in  a  familiar  environment  or  simply  needs  help.   ""Of  all  places,  why  did  Chabad  establish  a  house  in  Kathmandu?""  I  asked  Rabbi  Lifshitz.   ""We  want  to  establish  links  with  Jews  who  know  nothing  about  their  own  religion  and  culture;  we  want  to  provide  a  home  away  from  home,""  he  explained.   ""Many  Israeli  Jews  are  ignorant  of  their  own  heritage  because  of  the  religious-secular  divide  in  Israel.   ""When  overseas,  they  are  more  open  to  Jewish  religious  tradition  and  hope  that  they  will  find  answers  here.  Every  night  20-30  people  attend  shiurim.  On  their  return  they  see  Judaism  in  a  different  light.""   When  the  rabbi  is  not  busy  arranging  celebrations  for  an  upcoming  chag,  he  provides  trekking  information  and  tracks  down  lost  backpackers.  Last  year   800  visitors  attended  Rosh  Hashanah  celebrations  and  2000  were  at  the  last  Seder,  which  is  known  not  only  as  the  world's  biggest  seder  but  also  the  one  at  the  highest  altitude.   Often  travellers  arrive  in  Nepal   wishing  to  disconnect  from  the  known  world.  If  Rabbi  Lifshitz  receives  the  odd  anxious  call  from  parents,  he  relies  on  his  network  of  official  and  unofficial  Nepalese  con  tacts  to  find  the  missing  person.   Through  the  Chabad  House,  the  rabbi  arranges  medical  treatment  and  evacuation  where  necessary,  runs  a  luggage-storage  service,  mes  sage  board,  free  internet  access  and  a  travelers'  registration  service.  The  house  also  has  a  small  shul.   Rabbi  Lifshitz  also  serves  as  the  local  shochet  and  oversees  the  acqui  sition  of  other  kosher  food.  The  Chabad  House  restaurant  serves  a  wide  range  of  Israeli  food,  cheaply.   But  life  is  far  from  easy  in  Nepal.  ""Apart  from  third  world  levels  of  health  care,  western  concepts  of  business  are  non-existent,""  Rabbi  Lifshitz  explained.  ""People  see  noth  ing  wrong  with  coming  one  hour  or  one  week  late  for  an  appointment  and  can't  understand  why  that  should  upset  you.  The  hall  I  hired  to  accommodate  2000  people  for  seder  became  unavailable  a  week  before  Pesach,  because  the  owner  wanted  it  to  host  his  daughter's  wedding  reception  on  Seder  night.""   Fortunately  an  alternative  was  found  and  the  seder  went  ahead.   The  rabbi  is  also  actively  involved  in  the  religious  training  and  conver  sion  to  Judaism  of  the  Mizu  people.  The  Mizu  live  in  the  hardly  accessible  north-eastern  Indian  state  of  Mizuram,  between  Burma  and  Bangladesh.  Still  illiterate  150  years  ago,  a  local  prophet  decreed  that  the  Mizu  are  Jews  by  descent  from  the  sons  of  Menashe.  Some  have  begun  making  aliyah  and  formally  convert  ing  to  Judaism.  While  uncertain  about  their  precise  geneology,  Rabbi  Lifshitz  believes  the  Mizu  are  proba  bly  descendants  of  Jewish  traders  who  travelled  to  China  along  the  Silk  Road  1000  or  so  years  ago.

Musharraf’s  address  followed  closely  on  the  heels  of  his  brief  encounter  last  week  with  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  on  the  sidelines  of  the  United  Nations  World  Summit   and  a  recent  meeting  between  the  for  eign  ministers  of  the  two  countries,  which  do  not  have  full  diplomatic  ties.   But  challenged  by  Anti-Defama  tion  League  chairman  Abraham  Fox  man  to  show  more  leadership  by  moving  to  formalise  Israeli-Pakistani   relations  right  away,  Musharraf  responded  that  “57  years  of  hatred,  bit  terness,  and  animosity  cannot  be   undone  so  fast”.   “It  is  my  sincere  judgment  that  this  is  not  the  time  to  do  it,”  he  said  “We  need  to  be  very  patient.  I  need  some   more  reasons  and  rationale.  I  need   some  more  support”  to  be  able  to  con  vince  the  Pakistani  people  to  go  along   with  the  move.   While  he  referred  to  the  movie   Schindler’s  List  and  praised  Sharon  for  the  recent  Gaza  Strip  withdrawal,  Musharraf  upset  many  in  the  audience  by  insisting  that  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  is  a  root  cause  of  world  terror   ism  and  that  Pakistan  won’t  forge  diplomatic  ties  with  Israel  until  the  Palestinians  have  a  state  -  essentially  giving  the  Palestinians  a  veto  over  the  entire  process,  several  Jewish  leaders   noted  afterward.   Nonetheless,  “I  think  the  event  was   Pervez   Musharraf  speaking  at  the   Council   for  World  Jewry.   Photo:JTA   very  significant,”  said  Malcolm  Hoen  lein,  the  executive  vice-chairman  of  the  Conference  of  Presidents  of  Major  American  Jewish  Organisations.  “The  fact  that  it  took  place;  the  president  of  Pakistan  met  with  Jewish  leaders  and  it  was  broadcast  to  his  home  country.  Was  it  everything  everybody  wanted  to   hear?  Probably  not.   JlA ",2005-09-23

"  Jewish  roots  in  The  Producers   TOMTUGEND   •I   LOS  ANGELES  -  When  the  stage  ver  sion  of  The  Producers  played  in  Lon  don  in  2004,  British  reporter  Toby  Young  was  assigned  by  Vanity  Fair  magazine  to  interview  Nathan  Lane,   the  star  of  the  show.   Young  opened  the  interview  by  asking  Lane  whether  he  was  Jewish.  After  a  long  pause,  Lane  snapped:  “Yes,  yes,  what  of  it?”  Encouraged  by  the  answer,  the  reporter’s  next  ques  tion  was:  “Are  you  gay?”   Lane  responded  by  walking  out  of  the  interview.  When  Young  returned  to  his  office,  he  was  confronted  by  his  irascible  editor,  Graydon  Carter,  who  had  already  got  an  earful  on  the   incident.   “What  were  you  thinking?”   stormed  Carter.  “You  can’t  ask   celebrities  whether  they’re  Jewish  or  gay.  In  the  future,  just  assume  they’re  all  Jewish  and  all  gay,  OK?”   With  the  US  premiere  this  month   of  the  new  film  version  of  The  Pro  ducers,  stars  Nathan  Lane  and  Matthew  Broderick  have  been  facing  the  press  again.   Broderick  was  asked  whether  he   drew  on  his  background  when  play  ing  Leo  Bloom  and  other  Jewish  char  acters  in  Neil  Simon  plays.   “My  mum  was  Jewish.  My  back  ground  is  very  much  that  style  of  writing,  Neil  Simon  and  Mel  Brooks,  and  Your  Show  of  Shows  guys  are  what  I  grew  up  loving,”  he  said.   “So  I  probably  drew  on  my  New  York  background  and  my  Jewish  background  for  that.”   Lane  said:  “I  was  bom  Joseph  Lane,  but  when  I  applied  to  the  actor’s  union,  they  said  they  already  had  a  Joe  Lane  on  the  books  and  I’d  have  to   The  Producers  creator  Mel  Brooks  (right)  with  (from  left)  Nathan  Lane,  director  Susan  Stroman  and  Matthew  Broderick.   change  my  last  or  first  name.   “I  had  played  the  character  of  Nathan  Detroit,  whom  I  liked  very  much,  in  Guys  and  Dolls,  so  I  took  the   name  Nathan.   “I’m  really  an  honorary  Jew.  I  really  do  feel  Jewish,  even  though  I’m  a  Catholic.  I’ve  played  so  many  Jewish  characters,  it’s  been  a  great  part  of  my   life.”   Jewish  actor/director/writer  Mel  Brooks,  who  wrote  The  Producers,  was  keeping  a  low  profile  at  the  media  previews.   The  first  movie  version  of  The  Pro  ducers  was  released  in  1967,  starring  Zero  Mostel  and  Gene  Wilder  in  the  title  roles.   Broderick  observed  that  he  could   unspool  the  entire  movie  in  his  head  at  any  time.   Lane  and  Broderick  have  practi  cally  patented  their  roles;  Uma  Thur  man,  in  her  first  singing  and  dancing  role,  stars  as  the  secretary  Ulla;  Will  Ferrell  is  a  hilarious  addition  as  the   Nazi  “playwright”  Franz  Leibkind,   and  Gary  Beach  and  Roger  Bart  play  over-the-top  gay  producers.   In  the  film,  New  York  producer  Max  Bialystock  (Lane)  is  on  the  ropes  after  a  series  of  flops.  When  meek  accountant  Leo  Bloom  (Broderick)  comes  into  his  office  to  inspect  the  books,  Bloom  makes  a  discovery:  if  a  producer  raises  a  bundle  of  money  to  put  into  a  show,  but  it  closes  immedi  ately,  he  can  reap  a  windfall.   So  Max,  with  Leo’s  help,  raises  $2  million  from  amorous  elderly  ladies,  finds  the  world’s  worst  play,  worst  director  and  worst  actors  to  guarantee   instant  disaster.   They  strike  pay  dirt  with  Spring  time  for  Hitler,  but  the  play  becomes  a  hit  and  the  two  distraught  producers  end  up  in  jail.   Among  the  18  musical  numbers,  one  showstopper  is  I  Wanna  Be  a  Producer  in  which  director  Susan   Stroman  displays  her  roots  as  a   choreographer.

"  NSW  Opposition  Leader  John  Brogden,  during  his  visit  to  Israel  last  month,  lays  a  wreath  in  Be’er  Sheva  at  the  memorial  for  Australian  soldiers  who  fell  in  WWI.   Brogden  apologises  to  Jewish  leaders   ORYANA  KAUFMAN   NSW  Opposition  Leader  John  Brog  den  made  an  official  apology  to  the  peak  governing  body  of  the  NSW  Jewish  community  this  week  over  the  comments  he  made  about  NSW  Premier  Bob  Carr  and  Westfield  chief  Frank  Lowy  in  relation  to  the  Orange  Grove  Affair.   Brogden  had  used  the  term  “Judas”  to  allude  that  there  were  allegedly  improper  links  between  Westfield  chairman  Frank  Lowy  and  NSW  Premier  Bob  Carr  -  a  com  ment  which  prompted  Lowy  to  launch  a  defamation  suit  against  Brogden  in  the  ACT  Supreme  Court.   “Bob  Carr  is  a  Judas  to  the  people  of  Western  Sydney.  He  has  taken  his  30  pieces  of  silver  from  Westfield  and  they  get  a  good  deal,”  Brogden  said  last  September  after  Carr  tried  to  block  the  rezoning  of  the  Orange  Grove  site  in  Western  Sydney.   At  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  meeting  on  Tuesday  night,  Brogden  said:  “If  any  of  you  took  any  personal  offence  to  that,  and  I  know  many  of  you  will  have,  and  if  the  Jewish  community  in  general  took  offence,  and  I  know  that  it  might  have,  can  I  offer  my  very  per  sonal  apology.   “I  want  you  to  know  that  I  think  it  is  one  event  in  a  relationship  ...  I  hope  we  can  put  behind  us  and  move  on,”  Brogden  said.   He  also  extended  his  apology  to  Lowy.  “Of  course  I  extend  an  apolo  gy  [to  Lowy]  as  I  do  to  any  other  Jew   that  may  have  taken  offence,”  Brog  den  told  the  AJN  after  the  plenum,  reiterating  that  his  use  of  the  term  “Judas”  was  meant  for  Carr,  not  Lowy.   “As  I’ve  said  before,  my  use  of  the  phrase,  or  the  word,  was  one  through  a  lack  of  understanding  to  the  sensitivity  that  was  connected,”   he  said.   This  was  the  second  time  that   Brogden  publicly  discussed  his  “Judas”  comments  with  the  Jewish  community.  Last  October  he  said  he  “regretted”  his  choice  of  words  to  members  of  the  Jewish  community  at  an  Australia-Israel  Chamber  of  Commerce  function.   Board  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  told  the  AJN:  “The  Board  of  Deputies  appre  ciated  and  accepted  Mr  Brogden’s  apology  to  the  community.  It  was  a  fulsome  and  sincere  apology,  and  we  feel  that  this  matter  is  now  behind  us  and  that  the  community  should   move  on.”   Having  recently  returned  from  a  six-day  trip  to  Israel  as  a  Yachad  scholar,  Brogden  also  reiterated  his  “strong  support”  for  the  State  of   Israel  and  remarked  that  one  of  his  “most  moving”  visits  was  to  Yad   Vashem.   Also  at  this  month’s  plenum,  a  motion  was  unanimously  passed  to  include  an  acknowledgement  of  the  indigenous  owners  of  the  land  immediately  following  the  Board  of  Deputies  prayer,  recited  at  the  begin  ning  of  each  meeting.

"  AMERICAN  JEWISH  ECONOMIST  TO  HEAD  BANK  OF  ISRAEL     ZEV  STUB     JERUSALEM  -  In  a  surprising  last  minute  decision,  Israel  has  decided  to  appoint  an  American  Jew,  Citi-  group  vice  chairman  Stanley  Fischer,  as  the  next  governor  of  the  Bank  of  Israel.  The  post  is  charged  with  responsibility  for  the  country’s  mon-  etary  policies  and  is  equivalent  to  the  Australian  governor  of  the  Reserve   Bank.   The  Prime  Minister’s  Office  in  Jerusalem  said  Fischer,  a  former  deputy  director  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  had  accepted  the  offer,  which  will  require  approval  from  a  special  committee  for  senior  civil  service  appointments,  the  gov-  ernment  and  President  Moshe  Kat-  sav.  Although  he  was  the  nominee  of  both  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  and  Finance  Minister  Binyamin  Netanyahu,  in  the  days  leading  up  to  the  appointment  Fischer’s  name  had  not  been  mentioned  as  a  candidate.   Fischer,  61,  is  an  American  Jew  born  in  Zambia,  and  is  known  for  his  sharp  monetarist  economics.  He  has  a  long  history  of  involvement  with  Israel’s  economy,  first  as  an  eco-  nomics  student  at  Hebrew  Universi-   ty  in  the  1960s,  and  later  as  part  of  a  US  team  sent  to  advise  Israel  during  the  economic  stabilization  plan  of  the  mid-1980s,  when  hyperinflation  reached  400  per  cent.   Stanley  Fischer...  his  appointment   has  caused  controversy  because  he  is  not  Israeli.   irischer,  a  strong  Zionist,  will  oe   leaving  his  top  post  at  the  helm  of  the  world’s  largest  banking  corpora  tion  for  a  job  that  will  pay  him  an  estimated  NIS  56,000  ($A19,000)  a  month,  high  by  Israeli  standards  but  a  fraction  of  his  current  salary.  He  will  take  Israeli  citizenship  and  have  to  renounce  his  US  citizenship,  due  to  the  importance  of  the  post.  Shlo  mo  Maoz,  chief  economist  at  Excel  lence  Nessuah  Securities  Ltd.,  said  “Fischer  knows  the  Israeli  economy  in  great  depth,  having  spent  a  lot  of  time  here.  He  knows  how  to  handle  crises,  and  is  a  sympathetic  and  patient  man  who  will  set  up  and  work  with  an  advisory  board  at  the   bank.”   On  the  flip  side,  Maoz  said  it  is  “pathetic”  that  Israel  could  not  find  a   suitable  candidate  at  home.

"  MARCH  OF  LIVING  BOLOSTERS  JEWISH  IDENTITY  -  REPORT     CHANAN  TIGAY     NEW  YORK  -  A  decade  after  taking  part  in  the  March  of  the  Living,  Bradley  Laye  still  credits  his  experi-  ence  with  launching  him  along  the  path  to  a  career  in  Jewish  commu-   nal  service.   “The  march  was  the  thing  that  started  it,”  said  Laye,  now  the  CEO   of  Hillel  of  Broward  and  Palm  Beach,  Florida.  “It  was  the  seed  for  my  Jewish  involvement  and  love  of   Israel.”   The  program’s  long-lasting  effect  on  Laye  is  not  unique,  according  to  William  Helmreich,  the  author  of  a  newly  released  study  on  the  annual  program,  which  brings  Jewish  teenagers  from  across  the  globe  to   Auschwitz  and  then  on  to  Israel.   Indeed,  said  Helmreich,  a  sociol-  ogy  professor  at  the  Graduate  Cen-  ter  at  the  City  University  of  New  York,  “people  who  went  to  the  march  long  ago  report  that  even  12  years  later,  the  march  had  a  very,  very  powerful  impact  on  them.”   “The  point  of  the  program  is  to  affect  people’s  lives,  but  many  pro-  grams  succeed  and  many  fail,”  he  said.  “What’s  most  impressive  is  the   length  of  time  of  the  effect.”   The  new  study,  Long-Range  Effects  of  the  March  of  the  Living  on  Participants,  found  that  94  per  cent  of  those  who’ve  gone  on  the  program  believe  it  is  important  that  they  marry  a  Jew.   This  is  significant,  the  study  notes,  at  a  time  when  intermarriage  is  prevalent.     ""When  you’re  coupling   the  tremendous  tragedy  with  the  rebirth  of  Israel  back  to  back,  the   impact  becomes  long  lasting.”   DAVID  MACHLIS  Vice  Chairman,  March  of  the  Living     One-third  of  all  Jews  currently  wed  are  intermarried,  according  to  the  2000-01  National  Jewish  Popu-  lation  Survey,  which  also  found  that  intermarriage  is  rising  at  a  steady  pace  and  stands  at  47  percent.   The  new  march  study  also  found  that  94  percent  of  respondents  plan  to  provide  their  children  with  Jew-  ish  education;  nearly  25  percent   said  that,  like  Laye,  the  march  had  affected  their  career  choice;  nearly  two-thirds  said  the  march  had  made  them  more  tolerant  toward  other  groups;  and  85  percent  said  the  pro-  gram  made  them  more  likely  to  donate  to  Jewish  causes  -  with  66  percent  saying  they  had  already   done  so.   The  March  of  the  Living,  which  has  been  running  its  trips  since  1988,  brings  Jewish  teenagers  to  Poland  on  Holocaust  Remem-   brance  Day  to  march  from  Auschwitz  to  nearby  Birkenau,  where  the  prisoners  were  actually  gassed,  followed  quickly  by  a  trip  to  Israel  to  mark  the  Jewish  state’s  Memorial  Day  and  Independence  Day.   David  Machlis,  March  of  the  Liv-  ing’s  vice  chairman,  said  he  was  pleased  “but  not  surprised”  at  the  study’s  findings.   “When  you’re  coupling  the  tremendous  tragedy  with  the  rebirth  of  Israel  back  to  back,  the   impact  becomes  long  lasting,”  Machlis  said.  “It’s  very,  very  power-  ful.

Addressing  approximately  150  people  at  Perth's  Jewish  Centre  on  Sunday,  Solomon  plastered  the  walls  with  butcher's  paper  in  an  attempt  to  chart  the  history  of  the  Jewish  people  in  a  user-friendly  format.   Each  of  the  room's  four  walls  rep  resented  a  millennium  of  Jewish  his  tory,  spanning  from  2000  BCE  to  present  day.   From  the  exodus  from  Egypt,  to  the  ""cataclysmic""  destruction  of  the  First  and  Second  temples  and  the  story  of  Chanukah,  Solomon's  pres  entation  left  no  Jewish  stone  unturned.  Other  topics  included  the  Spanish  Inquisition  and  the  expul  sion  of  Jews  in  the  15th  century  which  ""shook  up  the  Jewish  world  completely"".   Solomon  plans  to  expand  the  one-hour  lecture  into  a  10-week  course  in  Jewish  history.  In  the   David  Solomon...  charting  the  history  of  Jews  in  one  hour.   future,  he  also  hopes  to  establish  a  not-for-profit  organisation  devoted  to  Jewish  studies  at  an  academic  level  for  ""the  purpose  of  wider  Jewish  education"",  and  making  Jewish  history  a  Year  12  subject.

"  GERMAN  JEWISH  LEADER  RIPS  CARDINAL   COLOGNE  -  Germany's  top  Jewish  leader  has  lashed  out  at  a  prominent  figure  in  Germany's  Roman  Catholic  church  for  appearing  to  compare  abor-  tion  to  the  Holocaust.   In  a  sermon,  Cardinal  Joachim  Meisner  of  Cologne  seemed  to  com-  pare  abortion  to  mass  killings  under  Hitler,  Stalin  and  Herod.  He  also  called  abortion  an  act  that  puts  ""all  previous  crimes  of  humanity  in  the  shadows”  during  a  New  Year’s  Day  sermon,  according  to  a  prepared  text  of  the  homily.   “First,  Herod,  who  had  the  children  of  Bethlehem  killed;  then,  among  oth-  ers,  Hitler  and  Stalin  who  had  millions  of  people  wiped  out;  and  today  in  our  times,  unborn  children  are  being  killed  a  million  times  over,”  Meisner  said  in  his  sermon.   Paul  Spiegel,  president  of  the  Cen-  tral  Council  of  Jews,  called  Friday  for  Meisner  to  take  back  his  words.   ""I  expect  that  the  cardinal  will  quickly  and  unequivocally  distance  himself  from  this  unspeakable  and  offensive  comparison,”  Spiegel  said.   JERUSALEM  POST ",2005-01-14
"  HABIB  IS  A  JEWISH  ISSUE   JANET  Green  claims  that  Mamdouh  Habib  is  “not  a  Jewish  issue”  (AJN   11/2).  But  in  light  of  the  copious  mate  rial  implicating  Habib  with  al-Qaeda,  I  beg  to  differ.  We  are  at  war  with  a   movement  of  Islamic  fanatics  whose  worldview  is  firmly  mired  in  the  sev  enth  century.  And  victory  over  this  global  Islamist  terror  network  is  a  vital  interest  to  the  Jewish  community,  both  in  Israel  and  here  in  Australia.   Mamdouh  Habib  chose  the  enemy  side  in  this  war.  According  to  Aus  tralian  intelligence,  Habib  underwent  terrorist  training  at  al-Qaeda  camps  on  five  different  occasions  between  1998  and  his  arrest  in  2001.  By  casting  his  lot  with  a  terrorist  organisation  that  violates  the  laws  of  war  by  deliber  ately  targeting  civilians,  Habib  became  an  illegal  combatant  and  was  treated  accordingly.   If  Habib  and  his  mentor  Osama  bin   Laden  had  their  way,  Jews  would  be  relegated  to  second  class  “dhimmi”  cit   izen  status  and  Green  would  be  con  fined  to  wear  the  “burka”.  In  light  of  this  “double  jeopardy”  in  the  jihadist  universe,  I  find  her  empathy  for  Habib  to  be  curious,  to  say  the  least.

Speaking  at  a  ceremony  at  the  Hakoah  Club  to  mark  the  10th  anniversary  since  the  assassination,  Yuval  Rabin,  on  his  first  visit  to  Australia,  told  200  people  of  his  late  father’s  personal  traits,  describ  ing  him  as  a  “very  worried  and  very  Jewish  father”.

Zionist  Federation  of  Australia  president  Dr  Ron  Weisertold  the  audience  that  the  bullets  that  killed  Rabin  “went  through  our  nation’s  soul”,  and  that  Jews  everywhere  felt  “shock,  horror  and  devasta  tion”  at  the  murder.

"  LORIN  BLUMENTHA1.   WHEN  Cranbrook  School  drama  teacher  Belinda  Rupp  saw  the  Holocaust  play  Ghetto  overseas,  she  knew  one  day  she  would  direct  it  in  Sydney.  Three  years  later,  she  realised  that  the  60th  anniversary  of  liberation  from  Auschwitz  would  be  her  perfect  opportunity.   ""It  was  a  story  worth  telling.  I  believed  in  the  message  -  asking  human  beings  never  to  stoop  this  low  again,""  Rupp  explains.   Rupp,  who  is  not  Jewish,  also  com  ments  on  the  importance  of  having  a  production  team  and  cast  from  a  vari  ety  of  different  religions  and  back  grounds,  promoting  a  message  of  tolerance  and  understanding  between  different  groups.   ""Ghetto  is  a  story  told  through  Jews  and  Germans  but  it  is  for  everyone  to  hear.  It  is  a  memory,  a  warning  for  the  present  and  a  warning  for  the  future,""  she  says.   For  her  part,  Rupp  was  reluctant  to  bring  her  own  German  heritage  to  light.  ""It  may  look  like  I  am  trying  to  seek  forgiveness  from  Jewish  people  in  some  way,""  she  explained.   ""German  identity  is  inextricably  linked  to  Nazi  Germany  and  I  believe  it   needs  to  be  for  a  few  more  generations  yet.""   Cranbrook  School  will  stage  the  production  in  association  with  Kambala  and  SCEGGS  Darlinghurst.  In  directing  the  production,  Rupp  has  relied  on  the  input  of  Israeli  playwright  Joshua  Sobol.   ""He  was  very  supportive  of  the  pro  duction.  He  gave  invaluable  insight  into  the  political  situation  at  the  time,  as  well  as  the  complexity  of  various  rela  tionships  that  existed  within  the  play,""  said  Rupp.   “Suddenly  there  seems  to  be  more  relevance  [in  the   Holocaust]  for  them.  Good  theatre  must  make  people  think.  I'm  hoping  that  this  will  happen  for  our   audiences  in  the  same  way  it  has  happened  for  the   students.”   BELINDA  RUPP  Drama  teacher,  Cranbrook  School   In  researching  their  roles,  the  cast  visited  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum,  where  they  met  Holocaust  survivor  Olga  Horak.   ""She  stressed  the  importance  of  accuracy  and  understanding,""  said  Rupp.  ""Many  of  the  children  waited  back  to  ask  personal  questions  about  their  own  heritage  and  Olga's  experi   ences.   Students  In  Ghetto  perform  a  dance  sequence.   ""The  children  understand  that  this  production  is  unlike  most.  They  know  this  because  their  character  names  are  that  of  real  victims  at  Vilna.   ""One  Year  12  student,  Craig  Dortkamp,  plays  Gens  the  leader  of  the  Jewish  police  in  the  Vilna  Ghetto.  When  researching  his  character,  he  was  deeply  moved  by  the  discovery  that  Gens  was  married  to  a  Christian  girl  which  meant  he  could  have  easily  lived  safely  with  his  wife  and  German  family  outside  the  ghetto.   ""Advised  to  escape,  he  answered:  'If  I,  leader  of  the  ghetto,  save  myself,  thousands  of  Jews  will  pay  for  my  flight   with  their  death.'""   Other  cast-members  were  prompted  to  seek  details  about  their  own  heritage.   ""Suddenly  there  seems  to  be  more  relevance  for  them.  Good  theatre  must   make  people  think.  I'm  hoping  that  this  will  happen  for  our  audiences  in  the  same  way  it  has  happened  for  the  stu   dents.   Ghetto  follows  the  destruction  of  the  80,000  Jews  of  Vilna,  Lithuania.  Despite  protests  from  various  groups  within  the  Vilna  Ghetto,  an  artists'  soci  ety  was  formed.  Its  first  public  perform  ance  was  on  the  18th  of  January,  1942.  In  its  first  year,  the  theatre  put  on  over  100  performances,  the  proceeds  of  which  were  often  used  to  help  feed  people  within  the  ghetto.  On  its  first  anniversary,  the  society  held  a  festival  in  the  ghetto  with  Yiddish  choir  recitals,   Cast  of  Ghetto,  which  will  be  performed  by  Cranbrook  School,  Kambala  and  SCEGGS   Daifinghurst  in  May.  Photos:  Patrick  Boland   jazz  performances  and  a  symphony  concert.  When  the  ghetto  was  liquidat  ed  in  1943,  70,000  tickets  had  been  sold.  Most  of  the  Jews  that  survived  the  ghetto  were  deported  to  the  Posnar  concentration  camp.   On  March  27,  1943,  survivor  Hermann  Kruk  wrote  in  his  diary,  ""In  a  hall  filled  to  capacity,  the  premier  of  Der  Oytser  took  place.  Outside  the  police  were  guarding  the  arrival  from  Swieciany.  Here  in  the  theatre,  as  if  nothing  were  happening  -  a  premier!  The  performance  is  smooth,  the  play  is  unblemished,  the  sets  really  beautiful  -  as  if  this  were  not  the  ghetto.""   Although  the  subject  matter  and  setting  are  dark,  the  play  has  a  spark  of  hope.  It  captures  the  role  of  theatre  in  bringing  humanity  from  darkness  into  light.   ""The  theatre  gave  the  Jews  of  Vilna  a  reason  to  keep  going  against  all  odds.  A  lot  of  the  music  used  in  the  perform  ance  comes  from  the  ghetto  theatre.  It  completely  overwhelmed  me,  ""  Rupp  explains.   Ghetto  was  first  performed  in  Haifa,   Israel  in  1988  and  was  surrounded  by  much  controversy.  Central  to  the  argu  ments  of  those  opposed  to  the  play  is  that  the  horrors  of  the  Holocaust  can  not  and  should  not  be  expressed,  least  not  in  musical  theatre.  Sobol  defended   his  play  in  the  program  of  a  London  performance  of  Ghetto  at  the  National  Theatre  in  London  in  1989.   ""Our  country  lives  on  a  frozen  ocean  of  tears;  my  urge  is  to  use  an  axe,  to  break  this  ice  and  let  the  tears  come  out  -  to  let  all  the  suppressed  humiliation  come  out  and  be  shared  with  the  rest  of  the  world.  It  is  an  artist's  duty  to  express  and  to  offer.  One  way  of  reconnecting  ourselves  to  the  rest  of  humanity  is  to  say:  ""Look  what  happened.  Look  what  history  has  done  to  us.""   Ghetto  has  been  performed  in  Australia  by  both  the  National  Institute  of  Dramatic  Art  and  Charles  Sturt  University.   Ghetto  will  be  staged  at  the  War  Memorial  Hall  at  Cranbrook  School,   from  May  12  to  May  15.   Inquiries:  9327  6864. ",2005-05-06
"  110  years  of  Jewish  news   IT  was  Philip  Graham,  the  former  publisher  of  the  Washington  Post,  who   coined  the  saying  that  journalism  is  the  “first  draft  of  history”.  He  was  right,  in  the  sense  that  we,  the  Australian  Jewish  News,  act  as  an  immedi  ate  record  of  news,  a  weekly  mirror  reflecting  the  life  and  times  of  Aus  tralian  Jewry  that  ultimately  becomes  documented  as  history.   But  the  role  of  the  AJN  is  also  to  provide  a  forum  for  ideas,  sometimes  con  troversial,  and  to  engage  its  readers  in  robust  debate.   We  do,  of  course,  have  several  “red  lines”  which  cannot  be  crossed.  We  do  not  promote  Holocaust  denial,  racism,  antisemitism  or  anti-Zionism.  Over  the  years,  however,  we  have  shifted  ideologically,  reflecting  the  changing  inter  national  landscape  and  the  evolving  local  Zeitgeist  Whereas  in  our  early  years,  the  Hebrew  Standard  of  Australasia,  our  predecessor,  was  anti-Zionist,  today  the  AJN  is  staunchly  and  proudly  Zionist.  Nonetheless,  we  are  not  uncritical  supporters  of  the  Israeli  Government  of  the  day;  we  believe  criti  cism,  where  justified,  is  part  and  parcel  of  any  democratic  society,  including  Diaspora  Jewry.   Likewise,  within  the  Jewish  community,  some  believe  that  we  must  defend  Jewish  organisations  at  all  costs  and  resist  hanging  our  proverbial  “dirty  laun  dry”  in  public.  While  we  view  ourselves  as  ardent  defenders  of  the  Jewish  community,  we  are  committed  to  retaining  our  independent  voice,  free  from  the  shackles  of  communal  politics.  Equally,  we  do  not  see  it  as  our  role  to  sani  tise  the  news,  censor  or  even  dilute  it  so  that  the  community  is  “protected”  from  the  truth.  Though  often  unpopular  with  parts  of  the  community,  we  believe  that  Australian  Jewry  is  strong  enough  and  resilient  enough  to  support  a  free,  unfettered  press.  Moreover,  we  believe  it  is  vital  for  the  ultimate  health  and  wellbeing  of  the  community  that  every  comer  be  scrutinised  in  an  open  and  transparent  manner.   The  AJN,  one  of  the  oldest  institutions  in  the  Australian  Jewish  commu  nity,  has  for  110  years  offered  Australian  Jews  its  weekly  diet  of  news  and  views.  We,  the  current  editors  and  publishers,  do  not  take  our  role  lightly.  We  are  convinced  that  the  prerequisite  to  this  newspaper  s  integrity  and  success  is  its  independence,  which  enables  us  to  report  and  comment  without  fear  or  favour.  That  is  our  mission,  the  very  same  mission  which  the  editors  of  the  Hebrew  Standard  enshrined  in  their  first  edition  on  November  1,1895. ",2005-11-11

It  just  goes  to  show  that  the  person  who  wrote  this  letter  made  a  big  mistake,”  Lassman  told  the  JC.

If  he  heard  a  Jew  was  in  trouble  anywhere  in  the  world,  he  moved  heaven  and  earth  to  get  them  out  to  safety.  He  was  like  a  father  to  all  of  us.

His  hope  -  part  of  a  “four-point  plan”  for  improving  the  Queens  Jewish  burial  ground,  much  of  which  is  overgrown  with  weeds  and  poison  oak  -  is  to  publish  the  database  on  the  internet  as  a  service  to  historians  and  Jewish  genealogists  with  ancestors  buried  there.

"  Can  you  be  Jewish  and  Australian?   ASK  THE  RABBI   RABBI  RITCHIE  MOSS   ANON-JEWISH  colleague  at   work  asked  me  the  following  question:  “Is  it  possible  to  be  a  loyal  Australian  and  a  proud  Jew  at   the  same  time?  It  seems  to  me  that  there  must  be  a  conflict  of  interests  there.  Can  you  really  be  both?”   We  don’t  live  in  Saudi  Arabia.  If   we  did  there  would  be  a  problem  -  according  to  its  laws,  you  can’t  be  Jewish  and  Saudi  Arabian.  There  is  only  one  way  to  be  a  Saudi  Arabian,  but  there  are  many  ways  to  be  Aus  tralian.  My  way  is  by  being  proudly  Jewish.  Not  only  is  there  no  conflict  -  having  a  strong  Jewish  identity   makes  me  a  better  Australian.   Australia  is  one  of  the  greatest  and  strongest  countries  in  the  world  today.  Not  because  of  its  gorgeous  beaches  or  first-class  cricket  team,  but  because  of  its  diversity.  Unlike  ,  most  Middle  Eastern  and  even  some   European  societies,  Australia  under  stands  that  welcoming  people  with  different  identities  will  not  weaken  Australia,  but  enrich  it.  Australia  is  a   big  conversation  of  cultures,  and  being  Australian  means  bringing  the  unique  voice  of  your  own  ethnicity  to  that  conversation,  by  being  who  you  are  to  the  fullest.   In  my  case,  that  means  living  an  active  and  proud  Jewish  life,  study  ing  the  ideals  and  values  of  Judaism  and  living  by  them,  and  sharing   them  with  those  around  me.  It  is  as  an  active  Jew  that  I  contribute  my  bit  to  Australia.  To  assimilate,  to  deny  my  Jewishness  or  bury  it  under  some  vague  generic  identity  would  be  to  rob  Australia  of  what  the  Jew  ish  voice  has  to  offer.  To  lose  my  Jewishness  would  not  only  be  going  against  my  own  inner  self,  it  would  be  downright  un-Australian.  But  to  live  Jewishly,  true  to  my  identity,  is  the  most  Australian  thing  I  can  do.   As  a  Jew,  I  thank  God  for  placing  me  in  a  country  as  free  and  open  as  Australia.  As  an  Australian,  I  thank  God  that  I  have  Jewish  values  to  guide  me  and  shape  my  identity.  I  am  proud  to  be  a  Jewish  voice  in  the  conversation  that  is  Australia.

Lescha  was  very  religious  and  Bellow  learned  Hebrew  and  Yiddish  as  a  youth.  He  attended  the  University  of  Chicago,  graduating  with  honours  in  sociology  and  anthropology.   His  first  novel,  Dangling  Man,  was  pub  lished  in  1944  and  his  second,  The  Victim,  in  1947.  The  Adventures  of  Augie  March  won  a  prize  for  fiction  in  1954  and  other  books  included  Seize  the  Day  (1956),  Henderson  the  Rain  King  (1959),  Herzog  (1964)  and  Mr  Sammlers  Planet  (1970).  Humboldt’s  Gift  was   awarded  the  Pulitzer  Prize  in  1976.   Bellow’s  first  non-fiction  work,  To  Jerusalem  and  Bach  A  personal  account,  published  in  1976,  was  a  personal  and  literary  record  of  his  sojourn  in  Israel.   Yiddish  phrases  and  syntax  are  found  in  many  of  the  novels.  In  Herzog  the  protagonist  is  snobbish  about  the  Yiddish  of  his  wife’s  lover.  In  The  Victim,  an  old  Yiddish  journalist  makes  a  beautiful  speech  that  defines  the   moral  vision  of  the  book.   In  novel  after  novel  by  Bellow  there  are  Jew  ish  characters  in  a  significantly  Jewish  milieu.  The  Victim  concerns  a  character  facing  anti  semitism  and  his  own  neurotic  defences  as  a  Jew.   Seize  the  Day  deals  with  a  son  who  wants  love  from  his  cold  father;  the  novel  ends  at  a  Jewish  funeral  with  the  protagonist  weeping  for  the  dead  stranger  and  for  himself.   Even  the  short  works  of  fiction,  especially  A  Silver  Dish  and  Something  to  Remember  Me  By  are  deeply  Jewish.   Awarded  the  Nobel  Prize  for  Literature  in   1976,  Bellow  has  given  us  a  new  kind  of  sen  tence,  composed  of  street  talk  and  philosophy,  mixing  language  of  the  heart  and  that  of  moneymen,  machers,  sports  and  con  men.   If  Israel  is  a  blessing  to  the  nations,  Bellow   has  been  a  Jewish  blessing  to  all  writers.   JTA   John  Clayton  is  a  retired  professor  of  modem  literature  at  the  University  of  Massachusetts.  His   books  include  Saul  Bellow:  In  defence  of  man. ",2005-04-15
"  Google-run  website   angers  Jewish  groups   CHANANT1GAY   NEW  YORK  -  Jewish  officials  are  angered  by  the  use  of  a  website  to  cre  ate  online  hate  communities,  but  they  are  taking  different  approaches  on   how  to  confront  the  issue.   Orkut.com  is  one  of  several  social   networking  services  available  on  the  internet.  Created  and  run  by  Google,  it  offers  users  the  opportunity  to  join  communities  where  topics  of  shared   interest  are  discussed.   In  addition  to  groups  celebrating  the  rap  artist  Eminem,  tequila  or  McDonald  s,  for  example,  some  users  have  developed  groups  for  people  who  share  a  distaste  for  particular  races,  ethnic  groups  or  sexual  orienta   tions.   One  such  community,  called  the  “Jewish  Problem”,  asks  users:  “Why  are  Jews  hated  so  much?  Well  here  is  the  place  to  tell  the  people  why.  They  own  entire  industries,  the  media,  and  even  America  itself.  They  have  too  much  ‘behind  the  scenes’  influence  and  it  needs  to  stop  now.”   The  number  of  people  who  join  the  hate  communities  is  relatively  small.  Whereas  the  Eminem  group  has  45,308  members,  the  Jewish  Prob   The  “Jewish   Problem”  online  community  is  one  of  several  on  the  Orkut   website  that  has  become  a  forum  for  anti-Jewish  or  anti-Israel  messages.   lem  -  whose  logo  is  a  stick  figure  throwing  a  Star  of  David  into  a  trash   can  -  has  14  members.   Brian  Marcus,  director  of  internet  monitoring  for  the  Anti-Defamation  League,  said  the  organisation  plans  to  contact  Google  about  the  Orkut  hate   communities.  But  he  also  said  that   singling  out  Google,  the  internet’s  most  popular  search  engine,  when  so  much  hate  speech  is  available  else   where  on  the  internet,  is  not  necessar  ily  productive.   David  Harris,  executive  director  of  the  American  Jewish  Committee,  said  such  instances  of  hatred  must  be  dealt  with  one  by  one.   “What  choice  do  we  have?”  asked   Harris,  whose  group  sent  a  letter  to  Google  on  Monday  demanding  that  the  company  enforce  its  own  terms  of  service,  which  forbid  hate  speech.  “You  do  it  retail,  you  can’t  do  it  wholesale.”   Last  year,  after  web  users  discov  ered  that  the  antisemitic  site  jew  watch.com  showed  up  in  the  top  position  when  they  searched  Google  for  the  word  “Jew”,  an  online  petition  campaign  was  launched  demanding  that  the  company  bump  the  site.   Also  in  2004,  a  French  court  ordered  Yahoo,  another  internet  search  engine,  to  “dissuade  and  render  impossible”  access  to  Nazi  artefacts  that  had  been  put  up  for  auction.

"  Bush  aide  with  a  Jewish  eye   MATTHEW  BERGER   WASHINGTON  -  Ari  Fleischer  remembers  being  advised  by  a  former  White  House  press  secretary  that  despite  the  demands  of  the  job,  he  should  stop  and  smell  the  roses.   He  recalled  that  advice  as  he  toured  the  Auschwitz  concentration  camp  with  President  George  W  Bush  in   2003.   There  were  not  any  roses,  but  there  was  plenty  to  fill  the  senses.   “I  stood  there,  as  an  aide  and  as  a  Jew,  watching  the  president  of  the  United  States  visit  the  spot  where  my  people  were  almost  exterminated,”   Fleischer  writes  in  his  new  book,   Taking  Heat,  which  has  been  published  by  Harper  Collins.   “I  wondered  what  my  relatives,  whom  I  never  met,  would  think  if  they  knew  I  had  returned  to  the  place  of  their  death  as  an  aide  to  the  presi  dent  -  a  president  who  had  emerged  as  Israel’s  best  friend  ever  in  the  Oval  Office,  a  president  who  had  profound  warmth  and  respect  for  the  Jewish  people.”   Fleischer  also  details  his  impres  sions  of  watching  President  Bush  meet  with  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  and  other  Middle  Eastern  leaders  on  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict,  and  of  Bush’s  decision  to  isolate  the  late  Palestinian  Authority   chairman  Yasser  Arafat.   His  belief  that  a  better  Palestinian  leader  could  emerge  if  only  the  envi  ronment  would  change  was  rooted  in  his  abiding  faith  in  freedom,  Fleischer   believes.   “Arafat  and  his  immediate,  corrupt  circle  were  the  real  problems,  Bush  thought,  not  the  Palestinian  people   and  not  Ariel  Sharon.”   Fleischer,  who  stepped  down  from  his  post  before  Bush’s  first  term  ended,  mostly  focuses  on  his  relationship  with   Former  White  House  press  secretary  Art  Fleischer.   Photo:  JTA   the  media  and  his  theses  that  the  media  enjoy  conflict  and  are  more  hostile  to  conservative  than  liberal  administrations.   While  several  former  Bush  White  House  officials  have  written  scathing  accounts  of  the  administration,  Fleis  cher’s  book  is  primarily  a  positive  reflection  on  the  president  and  the  administration’s  actions  over  the  past  four  years.   “I  wondered  what  my   relatives  would  think  if  they  knew  I  had   returned  to  the  place  of  their  death  as  an  aide  to  the  president.""   ARI  FLEISCHER  Former  White  House   press  secretary   Fleischer  writes  at  length  about  the  terrorist  attacks  on  the  United  States   on  September  11,2001,  and  about  the  ensuing  days.   He  writes  that  he  sought  permis  sion  from  his  rabbi  to  work  on  Rosh  Hashanah  a  week  later,  and  wanted  to  tell  the  White  House  press  corps  that  he  attended  services  that  morning.   “Working  on  a  high  holy  day  sent  a  terrible  signal  to  fellow  Jews,  and  I  was  uncomfortable,”  he  writes.  But  his  staff  told  him  it  would  be  better  if  he  left  it  alone.   “Don’t  bring  religion  into  the  briefing  room,  I  was  advised.  I  agreed.”   President  George  W  Bush  (centre)  discusses  the  Middle  East  peace  process  with   Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  (left)  and  Palestinian  leader  Mahmoud  Abbas  in  Aqaba,  Jordan,  in  June  2003.  Photo:  The  White  House   However,  when  specifically  asked  about  a  meeting  that  had  occurred  earlier  in  the  day,  Fleischer  did  say  he  had  been  at  a  synagogue.   Fleischer  mentions  some  of  the  mistakes  he  made  in  office,  including  his  suggestion,  during  a  briefing  in  February  2002,  that  president  Clinton  was  to  blame  for  exacerbating  violence  in  the  Middle  East.   He  told  reporters  that  the  Clinton  administration  had  tried  to  “shoot  the  moon  and  get  nothing”.  Fleischer  apologised  for  the  statement  later  in  the  day.   There  is  little  new  information  in  the  book.  However,  Fleischer  does  say  President  Bush  was  concerned  about  the  rise  of  antisemitism  in  Europe  and  hoped  the  media  would  make  a  bigger  deal  of  his  remarks  denouncing   antisemitic  acts.   Fleischer  does  not  say  much  about  his  Jewish  upbringing  and  does  not  address  his  decision  to  marry  a  non-Jewish  woman,  which  surprised  some  in  the  Washington  Jewish   community.   After  leaving  the  White  House,  Fleischer  joined  the  board  of  directors  of  the  Republican  Jewish  Coalition.   He  works  as  a  communications  consultant  and  has  a  busy  public  speaking  schedule,  including  to  many   Jewish  groups.   JTA ",2005-03-25
"  Shull  Rand  in  the  Israeli  film  Ushpizin.   Arts&amp;Books   Jewish  flavour  at  film  festival   MARK  FRANKLIN   THE  Sydney  Film  Festival  opens  next  week  with  a  strong  Jewish  flavour.  Among  the  large  selection  of  movies  are  Jewish-related  films  which  span  the  themes  of  antisemitism,  Ortho  dox  Jewry,  the  Israeli  peace  move  ment  and  Palestinian  suicide  bombers.   Paradise  Now,  which  won  the  award  for  best  European  film  at  the  Berlin  Film  Festival  in  February,  is  set  around  two  Palestinian  youths  who  agree  to  carry  out  a  suicide  attack  in   Tel  Aviv.   The  film  has  been  criticised  for  glorifying  suicide  bombers,  but  Amir  Harel,  head  of  the  Israeli  production  company  that  helped  make  the  film,   said  that  was  not  the  case.   “It  manages  to  efficiently  portray  the  great  tragedy  of  the  occupation,  and  the  way  it  corrupts  both  the  Israeli  and  the  Palestinian  sides,”  he  said  when  it  was  screened  in  Berlin.   In  contrast,  Little  Peace  of  Mine  fol  lows  a  12-year-old  Israeli  boy,  Nadav,  as  he  heroically  forms  a  peace  foun  dation  after  seeing  a  busload  of  chil   dren  killed  in  a  terrorist  attack.   He  decides  grown-ups  can  no  longer  be  trusted  to  bring  peace  and  begins  recruiting  children  to  his  group,  which  aims  to  unite  Jewish  and  Palestinian  youths.   The  documentary  was  filmed  over  two  years  as  Nadav  befriends  a  charismatic  Palestinian  girl  who  helps  his  cause.  Described  by  critics   as  a  “beautiful  celebration  of  what   little  people  can  do”,  it  is  both  painful  and  uplifting.   Another  documentary,  Protocols  of  Zion,  takes  a  Michael  Moore-style  look  at  the  widespread  influence  of  a  mythological  book  which  supposedly  documents  a  Jewish  plot  for  world   domination.   New  York  film-maker  Mark  Levin  confronts  Arab-Americans,  Black  nationalists,  Christian  evangelicals,  Aryan  skinheads  and  others,  many  of  whom  say  it  was  the  Jews  who   orchestrated  the  9/11  attacks.   The  film  was  extremely  popular  at  the  Sundance  Film  Festival,  where   organisers  said  it  “has  never  been   more  relevant  or  crucial  as  a  reminder  that  hate  only  breeds  more   hate”.   Meanwhile,  Ushpizitt  sees  one  of  Israel’s  leading  actors,  Shuli  Rand,  return  to  the  screen  after  devoting  himself  to  Judaism  for  the  past  nine  years.  He  plays  a  born-again  Jew,  Moshe,  who  receives  unexpected  guests  on  Succot  -  two  escaped  con  victs  from  Moshe’s  secular  past.  Their  presence  brings  havoc  to  the  Ortho  dox  community  and  tests  Moshe’s   newfound  faith.   Directed  by  Sydney   film-maker  Tony  Krawitz,  Jewboy  recently  won   praise  from  critics  at  the  Cannes  Film  Festival.   Despite  the  numerous  restrictions  associated  with  having  an  ultra  Orthodox  Jew  in  the  lead  role  (including  his  refusal  to  act  alongside  any  women  other  than  his  non-thes  pian  wife)  Ushpizin  received  rave   reviews  and  has  won  several  awards.   Although  not  included  in  the  main  program,  Jewboy  and  The  Loser   Who  Won  are  two  of  17  short  films   AN  Sulintan  (left)  and  Kals  Nashef  in  Paradise  Now,  to  be  screend  at  the  Sydney   Film  Festival.   competing  in  the  Sydney  Film  Festi  val’s  Dendy  Awards.   Directed  by  Sydney  film-maker  Tony  Krawitz,  Jewboy  recently  won  praise  from  critics  at  the  Cannes  Film  Festival.  It  tells  the  story  of  Yuri  Kovn  er,  the  son  of  a  Chassidic  rabbi,  as  he  struggles  with  his  own  faith  after  his   father’s  death.   The  Loser  Who  Won  is  an  experi  mental  digital  film  about  a  “loser”   who  moves  from  Melbourne  to   Sydney  and  finds  his  true  love  through  the  help  of  a  90-year-old  Jewish  pensioner.

"  WORLD  VIEWS   JEWISH  LEADER  LAMBASTS  POPE   BERLIN  -  A  German  Jewish  leader  has  criticised  the  Pope  Saturday  for  making  what  he  called  an  unacceptable  com  parison  between  abortion  and  the  Nazi  Holocaust  in  his  new  book.  OPaul  Spiegel,  the  head  of  Germany's  Central  Council  of  Jews,  told  the  Netzeitung  daily  that  Pope  John  Paul  ll’s  compari  son  shows  that  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  “has  not  understood  or  does  not  want  to  understand  that  there  is  a  tremendous  difference  between  factory  like  genocide  and  what  women  do  to   their  bodies.""   Spiegel  was  referring  to  a  passage  in  Memory  and  Identity:  Conversations  Between  Millenniums,  where  the  Pope  draws  a  broad  comparison  between  abortion  and  the  Holocaust,  saying  both  derived  from  governments  in  conflict   with  God’s  laws.

"  Jewish  social  action  month   a  success   GREER  EAY  CASHMAN   JEWISH  social  action  month,  a   new  initiative  advanced  by  the  Kol  Dor  young  leadership  movement,  culminated  last  week  with  a  global  video  conference  and  Talmud  study  session.   The  session  originated  from  Jerusalem,  but  also  incorporated  participants  in  Cape  Town,  Berlin,  Paris,  San  Francisco,  Moscow,  London  and  Melbourne.   Jewish  social  action  month,  which  was  founded  in  conjunction  with  former  deputy  minister  for  social  and  diaspora  affairs,  Rabbi  Michael  Melchior,  was  initiated  to  foster  awareness  of  the  mutual  responsibility  that  Jews  have   towards  each  other  and  to  human   ity  as  a  whole.   Launched  in  the  Knesset  at  the   beginning  of  the  Hebrew  month  of  Cheshvan,  the  concept  received  attention  and  support  in  other  par  liaments  around  the  world,  attract  ing  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  who  demonstrated  solidar  ity  with  the  overriding  principle   that  when  someone  is  in  need  of   help,  someone  else  has  to  step  in  and  provide  it.   Jews  worldwide  volunteered  for  projects,  working  within  the  Jewish  community  and  beyond,  said  Rabbi  Melchior.  Many  volunteered  to  help  victims  of  floods  and  earthquakes.  In  Jerusalem,  a  group  of  people  spruced  up  the  homes  of  the  needy.   Rabbi  Melchior  explained  that  the  person-to-person  approach  is  a  test.  “We  will  be  tested  not  only  on  peace  and  war,  but  on  how  we  relate  to  each  other.”   At  the  recent  general  assembly  of  Jewish  organisations,  all  Jewish  federations  in  the  United  States  made  an  undertaking  to  work  for  Jewish  social  action  month,  as  did  all  streams  of  Judaism.   It  is  often  difficult  to  unite  Orthodox  and  Reform,  said  Rabbi  Melchior,  and  although  they  have  not  exactly  come  together  in  working  towards  Jewish  social  action,  each  stream  has  adopted   the  month  of  Cheshvan  as  social  action  month.   Acutely  aware,  both  as  a  spiri  tual  and  a  political  leader,  of  the  divisiveness  among  the  Jewish  people,  Rabbi  Melchior  sees  Jewish  social  action  month  as  a  bridge  or   a  common  denominator.   While  there  is  debate  on  whether  the  Shulchan  Aruch  is   binding  on  the  individual  during  every  waking  moment,  he  said  there  should  be  no  debate  on  a  communal  code  of  Jewish  law.   Rabbi  Melchior’s  suggestion  with  regard  to  the  communal  as  distinct  from  the  personal  Shulchan  Aruch  was  that  people  be  judged  according  to  a  single  paradigm:  “How  we  relate  to  each  other  and  help  each  other  when   one  of  us  is  in  need.”   Rabbi  Melchior  was  optimistic  that  Jewish  social  action  month  will  become  a  permanent  fixture  on  the  Jewish  calendar,  thereby  giving  new  status  to  Cheshvan,  which  does  not  have  any  Jewish   festivals.

Photo:  Tony  Walsh     GROWING  GERMAN  INTEREST  IN  JEWISH  HISTORY     TONY  WALSH     GERMANS  are  showing  more  interest  in  Jewish  history  today  than  a  decade  or  two  ago,  according  to  Nigel  Cox,  head  of  exhibitions  at  the  Jewish  Museum  Berlin.   “There  is  a  very  great  interest  in  Jewish  culture  in  this  country,”  said  Cox,  a  New  Zealander  who  joined  the  museum  three  years  ago.   “It  is  rare  to  find  a  German  who   does  not  know  something  about  Jewish  culture.”   Cox  joined  the  Jewish  Museum  Berlin  in  2000  from  Wellington  after  working  as  concept  developer  at  Te  Papa,  the  national  museum  of   New  Zealand.   The  Jewish  Museum  Berlin  has  become  one  of  Germany’s  leading  cultural  attractions  with  more  than  700,000  visitors  a  year.   At  a  gala  function  on  September  9,  2001  -  just  days  before  the  terror   attacks  on  New  York’s  Twin  Towers  -  to  celebrate  the  official  handover  of  the  museum  to  the  German  gov-  ernment,  museum  director  W  Michael  Blumenthal  said:  “The  museum  is  not  for  Jews.  Jews  are  welcome,  but  the  museum  is  for   Germans.  It’s  the  museum  to   remind  Germans  of  the  price  of   intolerance.”   Berlin’s  Jewish  museum  was  established  in  1971,  the  year  in  which  the  city’s  Jewish  community   commemorated  its  300th  anniver-   sary,  after  Berlin’s  previous  Jewish  museum  had  been  closed  by  Hitler   in  1938.   By  the  1980s  the  museum  need-  ed  more  gallery  space  and  launched  an  architecture  competition  for  major  extensions.   Acclaimed  architect  Daniel  Libe-  skind  won  the  competition  in  June  1989  and  the  Libeskind  building  was  opened  to  the  public  in  January  1999.  It  soon  became  a  great  public  attraction  boasting  350,000  visitors   a  year.   On  September  1,  2001,  the  city  of  Berlin  handed  over  responsibili-  ty  for  the  museum  to  the  German  government  and  opened  the  gala  exhibition  Two  Millennia  of  Ger-  man  Jewish  History.

"  Poland’s  new  Jewish  foreign  minister   CAROLYN  SLUTSKY   CRACOW  -  Adam  Daniel  Rotfeld,  who  replaced  Wlodzimierz  Cimos  zewicz  as  Poland’s  foreign  minister  earlier  this  year,  was  bom  to  a  large  Jewish  family  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  country,  near  what  is  now  the  Ukrainian  city  of  Lvov.   He  spent  the  years  between  1941  and  1948  hiding  in  a  monastery,  and   then  he  lived  in  a  children’s  home  in  Cracow.  He  was  one  of  two  family  members  to  survive  the  Holocaust.   After  the  war,  Rotfeld  studied  international  law  and  diplomacy  in  Warsaw  and  Krakow.  He  mostly  ignored  his  Jewish  background.  He  is  open  about  being  Jewish,  but  he  makes  no  attempt  to  join  the  Jewish  community,  and  community  leaders  respect  that  position.   All  religion  was  looked  on  unfavourably  in  Poland  during  the  communist  era.  Jews,  in  particular,  faced  unemployment  and  discrimi  nation  if  they  were  open  about  prac  ticing  their  religion  —  or  even  about  simply  being  of  Jewish  descent.  Often  they  faced  discrimination  even  if  they  were  not  open  about  being  Jewish.  March  of  1968  saw  a  huge  antise  mitic  purge  in  Poland,  and  thousands  of  survivors  and  their  families  who   Polish  Foreign  Minister  Adam  Daniel  Rotfeld  (left)  and  NATO  Secretary-General,   Lord  Robertson.  Photo:  nato   had  stayed  in  Poland  after  World  War  II  left.  They  went  to  Israel,  Scandi  navia  and  the  United  States,  among  other  destinations.   For  nearly  30  years,  starting  in  1961,  Rotfeld  worked  in  the  Polish  Institute  of  International  Affairs.  He  was  forced  out  for  some  time  right  after  March  1968  as  he  had  both  a  Jewish-sounding  name  and  what  was   considered  to  be  a  Jewish  look.  He  was  denied  a  passport  until  1973  -  a  situation  that  was  particularly  infuri  ating  for  him  as  a  specialist  in  inter   national  affairs.   In  1989,  Rotfeld  became  director  of  the  Stockholm  International  Peace  Research  Institute.  He  remained  there  until  2002,  when  he  was  named  vice  minister  of  foreign  affairs.   Since  the  end  of  the  communist   era,  several  politicians  and  other  notable  Poles  have  been  accused  by  their  detractors  of  having  Jewish  roots.  Tadeusz  Mazowiecki,  who  in  1989  became  the  country’s  first  post  communist  prime  minister,  lost  a  bid  for  the  presidency  the  next  year.  His  loss  was  attributed,  in  part,  to  a  whisper  campaign  that  accused  him  of  being  Jewish.   Michael  Schudrich,  Poland’s  chief  rabbi,  said,  “My  sense  is  that  Rotfeld  is  talking  about  it  not  to  head  off  the  critics  but  simply  because  that  is  who  he  is.  He  is  a  very  straightforward  and  honest  person.  I  would  agree  with  those  who  simply  think  that  Rotfeld  being  Jewish  is  not  a  real  issue  for   Poland.”   Today  Poland  is  seen  by  many  as  one  of  Israel’s  best  friends  in  Europe.  Krajewski  said,  “Poland  is  among  the  most  pro-Israel  countries.  Paradoxi  cally,  in  Poland  -  and  I  think  in  much  of  Europe  -  Jews  are  some  times  less  willing  to  promote  pro  Israeli  attitudes  than  non-Jews,  who  are  not  afraid  of  the  double  loyalty   accusations.”  He  added  that  he   believes  the  foreign  minister’s  reli  gious  background  should  have  no  bearing  on  Polish/Israeli  relations.

"  Israel  to  be  largest  Jewish  community   BETH  ALEXANDER   JERUSALEM  -  For  the  first  time  in  2000  years,  Israel  will  next  year  become  the  largest  Jewish  community  in  the  world,  according  to  figures  released  by  a  Jewish  Agency  think  tank   this  week.   Today,  there  are  about  13  million  Jews  worldwide,  while  in  2020  the  fig   ure  will  increase  to  an  estimated  13.6  million  Jews.  While  the  number  of  Diaspora  Jews  will  decrease  by  half  a  million  by  2020,  the  report  estimates  that  the  Jewish  population  in  Israel  will  grow  by  one  million.   At  present,  5.28  million  Jews  reside  in  the  United  States  while  5.235  mil  lion  are  Israeli  citizens.  Both  commu   nities,  the  report  stated,  comprise  80  per  cent  of  world  Jewry.   Other  findings  list  the  French  Jew  ish  community,  totalling  494,000  as  the  largest  in  Europe,  making  it  the  third  largest  Jewish  community  in  the   world.   I  The  most  prospering   communities  in  the   Diaspora  are  located  in  Australia,  Mexico  and  Canada.   In  terms  of  the  quality  of  life  Jews  enjoy,  the  study  found  that  90  per  cent  of  world  Jewry  lives  in  the  top  20  per   cent  of  the  wealthiest  and  most  devel   oped  countries.  The  most  prospering  communities  in  the  Diaspora  are  located  in  Mexico,  Australia  and  Canada.   After  analysing  marriage  statistics,  the  report  concluded  that  the  majori  ty  of  Jews  outside  Israel  intermarry.  In  Russia  and  the  Ukraine,  the  rate  of  intermarriage  stands  at  about  80  per  cent  as  compared  to  only  three  per  cent  of  Jews  who  intermarry  in  Israel.   In  the  battle  of  the  numbers  of  Jews  who  had  visited  Israel,  the  Unit  ed  Kingdom  outnumbered  the  United  States  by  a  surprising  80  per  cent  to  35   per  cent.   Less  surprising,  given  the  recent  alarming  news  reports  emerging  from  Europe,  about  96  antisemitic  attacks  per  year  -  the  highest  in  the  world  -  convinced  nearly  2000  French  Jews  to  immigrate  to  Israel  -  the  most  from  any  other  country.   Regarding  Jewish  education,  the  report  highlights  that  a  relatively-high   number  of  children  are  enrolled  in  Jewish  schools  in  South  America  (55  85  per  cent),  while  in  Europe  and  the   former  Soviet  Union  the  numbers  are   much  lower  (25  per  cent  at  most,  excluding  France  which  stands  at  40  per  cent  and  Britain  at  60  per  cent).

"  Guyana's  powerbroker  is  a  Jewish  bobba   WILLIAM  STOF   GEORGETOWN,  Guyana  -  Voters  in  Guyana  are  asking  over  and  over  again  who  Janet  Rosenberg  Jagan  will  sup  port  in  their  presidential  election  early   next  year.   An  85-year-old  Jewish  grandmother  bom  and  raised  in  Chicago,  Jagan  is  an  unlikely  powerbroker  in  this  remote  country  of  740,000  people  on  the   northern  rim  of  South  America.   The  Guyanese  people  elected  Jagan  president  in  late  1997  shortly  after  the  death  of  her  husband,  President  Cheddi  Jagan,  a  lifelong  Marxist.  She  resigned  the  presidency  after  almost  two  years  in  office  when  she  suffered  a   heart  attack.   Jagan  and  her  husband  founded  the  People’s  Progressive  Party  (PPP)  in  1950,  when  Guyana  was  still  a  British  colony  known  as  British  Guiana.   In  1953,  the  British  introduced  lim  ited  self-government  to  Guyana  and  the  PPP  won.  Jagan  was  elected  to  par   liament  and  her  husband  became  chief  minister.  The  British  “kicked  us  out  after  four-and-a-half  months”,  she  says.  “The  constitution  was  suspended   and  British  Marines  were  brought  in.”   Jagan’s  husband  was  jailed  for  six  months  for  travelling  out  of  town.  The  day  he  was  released,  Jagan  herself  was  imprisoned  for  “attending  a  political  meeting”   In  1992,  a  quarter-century  after  Guyana  achieved  independence,  Jagan’s  husband  won  a  free  and  fair  election  as  president,  and  Jagan  was  named  Guyana’s  ambassador  to  the  United  Nations.  When  her  husband   died  five  years  later,  she  became  presi   dent  -  making  her  the  first  white  pres  ident  of  Guyana,  the  first  elected  female  president  in  South  America  and  the  first  Jewish  head  of  state  in  South  American  history.   Jagan  doesn’t  keep  kosher  and  isn’t  observant  at  all,  though  she  proudly  displays  a  silver  menorah  in  her  home  -  given  to  her  in  1962  by  Israeli  prime  minister  David  Ben-Gurion,  when  both  were  activists  in  the  international  socialist  movement.   Surprisingly,  Guyana  -  South  America’s  only  English-speaking  country  -  also  is  the  only  country  on  the  continent  without  a  synagogue  or  Jewish  community.  In  feet,  Jagan  is  believed  to  be  one  of  only  10  or  so  Jews  in  all  of  Guyana.   Her  son  Joey,  56,  a  dentist,  is  start  ing  his  own  political  movement,  the  Unity  Party.  If  the  party  takes  off,  Guyana  could  once  again  have  a  Jewish  president  according  to  halacha,  or  Jew  ish  law,  though  his  mother  declined  to  speculate  on  her  son’s  chances  of  win  ning  the  next  election.   “My  son  and  I  don’t  discuss  these  things  at  all,”  Jagan  said  with  a  smile.

"  Beslan  survivors  frolic  at  Jewish  camp   RUTH  ELLEN  GRUBER   SZARVAS,  Hungary  -  In  T-shirts,  jeans  and  sneakers,  the  children  chew  ing  on  kosher  chicken  in  a  brightly  decorated  dining  hall  looked  like  kids  at  any  other  Jewish  summer  camp.   j  They  clowned  a  little,  linked  arms   and  swayed  to  after-lunch  songs,  and  cheered  when  a  teenage  girl  was  hoist  ed  on  a  chair  to  celebrate  her  birthday.   But  these  kids  were  different.   The  75  boys  and  girls  were  sur  vivors  of  the  bloody  terrorist  siege  and  massacre  last  September  that  took  the  lives  of  more  than  300  people  at  a  school  in  the  town  of  Beslan,  in  southern  Russia.   Aged  seven  to  18,  most  of  the  kids  had  lost  a  brother,  sister  or  parent  in  the  carnage,  and  many  had  themselves  suffered  serious  injuries  during  the  three-day  ordeal.   None  of  them  were  Jewish,  and  few  even  knew  anything  about  Jews  or  Judaism.   But  thanks  to  the  initiative  of  one  of  Russia’s  two  chief  rabbis,  Adolf   Shayevich,  they  were  brought  to  Hun  gary  this  month  for  a  week  of  rest  and  recuperation  at  the  Ronald  S  Lauder  Foundation/American  Jewish  Joint  Distribution  Committee  (JDC)  Inter  national  Jewish  Summer  Camp  at   Szarvas.   Hosted  by  the  JDC,  they  partici  pated  in  a  specially-designed  program  that  integrated  traditional  summer  camp  activities  such  as  sports,  arts  and  crafts,  and  informal  education  with  ongoing  post-trauma  therapy.   “We  are  trying  to  make  them  feel  normal  again,”  said  Sasha  Piatigorsky,  program  director  of  the  Moscow  Jew  ish  Religious  Community,  who  accompanied  the  children  and  helped  co-ordinate  their  stay.  “They  behave  normally  and  feel  good,  but  some  times  you  will  see  them  crying  for  no  reason,”  he  said.  “And  some  of  the  girls  don’t  smile,  because  they  lost  their  teeth  in  the  attack.”   The  Beslan  crisis  erupted  on  Sep  tember  1,2004,  the  first  day  of  school,  when  terrorists  stormed  the  school  and  took  more  than  1000  people   Beslan   survivors  liven   things  up  at  the   Szarvas  camp  in  Hungary.

The  largest  Jewish  camp  in  Europe,  Szarvas  opened  in  1990  and  now  hosts  about  2000  children  from  dozens  of  countries  each  summer.  Owned  by  the  Ronald  S  Lauder  Foundation  and   operated  by  the  JDC,  it  has  developed  rich  programming  and  infrastructure  with  a  trained,  professional  staff.   Each  day  in  Szarvas,  the  children  took  part  in  a  range  of  activities  that   taught  them  about  different  cultures  and  countries,  including  Japan,  Egypt   and  Israel.   “I  loved  the  Japanese  evening,”  said  Marina,  14,  who  was  sporting  big  hoop  earrings.   Ina,  16,  agreed  that  the  week  at  Szarvas  was  helping  her  cope.   “I  wish  no  kid  anywhere  in  the  world  would  even  see  what  we  saw,”  she  said.  “Szarvas  is  making  me  feel  much  more  comfortable  and  [helping  me]  to  realise  that  life  can  go  on.  Here,  we  are  not  thinking  about  what  happened  there.”   JTA ",2005-06-24
"  The  key  qualities  of  being  a  Jew   RABBI  REUVEN  HAMMER   places  a  different  perspective  on  a  vexed  but  oft-asked   question,  ""Who  is  a  Jew?""   I  “It  is  more  important  to   be  a  disciple  of   Abraham  and  to  live   according  to  his  ways   and  his  teachings  than  to  be  a  biological   I  descendant  of  him.""   WHO  is  a  Jew?  This  question  is  end  lessly  debated  and  has  become  the  source  of  controversy  in  the  Knesset   as  well  as  in  rabbinical  circles.   There  is  another  related  question,  however,  that  should  command  our  attention:  What  is  a  Jew?  What  are  the  qualities  and  characteristics  that,  according  to  the  tradition,  make  us  what  we  are  or  what  we  should  be?   There  are  many  sources  that  deal  with  this,  all  of  which  have  a  common  answer:  A  Jew  is  one  who  follows  the   ways  of  goodness  and  decency  in  human  relationships.   Let  us  look  at  three  formulations   of  this  basic  truth.  The  first  is  given  in  Pirkei  Avot,  a  general  guide  to  Jewish  living  and  the  only  section  of  the  Mishnah  that  deals  with  questions  of  belief  and  theology.   It  says:  Whoever  possesses  these  three  qualities  is  a  disciple  of  our  father  Abraham:  a  generous  spirit,  a  humble  soul,  a  modest  appetite  [not  greedy].  Whoever  possesses  these  three  qualities  is  a  disciple  of  the  wicked  Balaam:  a  grudging  spirit,  an  arrogant  soul,  an  insatiable  appetite.  (Avot  5:21)   These  specific  qualities  were  derived  from  verses  in  the  Torah  describing  the  fives  of  these  two  men.  The  important  aspects  are  the  quali  ties  that  the  sages  identified  with  the  father  of  our  people  and  wanted  to  inculcate  in  us  as  the  proper  way  to   five.   Note  that  they  use  the  phrase  “dis  ciples  of”  rather  than  “children  oP  to  indicate  that  biological  descent  is  not   critical.   It  is  more  important  to  be  a  disci  ple  of  Abraham  and  to  live  according  to  his  ways  and  his  teachings  than  to  be  a  biological  descendant  of  him.   One  who  takes  pride  in  being  a  Jew  should  consider  that  conduct  is  more  important  than  birth.  One  can  be  a  Jew  by  accident  of  birth,  but  one  is  worthy  of  being  a  disciple  of  Abra  ham  only  if  one  shares  Abraham’s  qualities.  Modesty,  humility  and  gen  erosity  are  the  marks  of  the  true  Jew.   A  second  source  that  teaches  us  the  qualities  that  define  a  Jew  is  found  in  the  words  of  the  prophet  Jeremiah:  “Let  not  the  wise  man  glory  in  his  wisdom;  Let  not  the  strong  man  glory  in  his  strength;  Let  not  the  rich  man  glory  in  his  riches.  But  only  in  this  should  one  glory:  In  his  earnest  devo  tion  to  Me.  For  I,  the  Lord,  act  with  kindness,  justice  and  equity  in  the  world;  for  in  these  I  delight.”  (Jere  miah  9:22)   A  Jew  is  defined  as  one  who  acts  with  kindness  toward  others  and  pro  motes  justice  and  equity  among  peo  ple.  Wisdom,  physical  strength  and  wealth  are  not  the  ultimate  goals  of  life;  rather  they  must  be  used  to  achieve  social  justice  in  the  society  in   which  we  live.   Jeremiah  has  a  unique  definition  of  devotion  to  God,  of  closeness  to  the  Almighty.  It  is  not  to  be  found  in  piety,  not  in  worship  or  sacrifice,  not  even  in  observance  of  rituals,  impor  tant  as  these  may  be.   The  first  measure  of  devotion  is  in  one’s  conduct  towards  others,  a  mix  ture  of  kindness  and  justice.  In  a  world  filled  with  corruption,   Kindness  towards  others...

Photo:  JTA   favouritism  and  inequality,  the  Jew  is   one  who  works  to  eliminate  these  injustices  and  establish  instead  a  soci  ety  that  will  bring  delight  to  God.   Finally  there  is  the  answer  given  by  Hillel  to  the  potential  proselyte  who  asked  to  be  taught  the  whole  Torah  standing  on  one  foot.   “That  which  is  hateful  to  you,  do  not  do  to  your  fellow  human  being,”  replied  Hillel.  “That  is  the  whole  Torah.  Go  study,”  (Shabbat  31a)  giv  ing  a  negative  Aramaic  formula  of  the  verse  “Love  your  fellow  as  yourself”  (Leviticus  19:18).   The  same  answer  was  given  a  cen  tury  later  by  Rabbi  Akiva,  who  called  that  verse  “A  great  general  rule  of  the  Torah”  (Yerushalmi  Nedarim  9:4).   Neither  Hillel  nor  Rabbi  Akiva  were  contemptuous  of  all  the  other  commandments  in  the  Torah,  nor  did  they  wish  to  eliminate  rituals.  What  they  were  saying  was  that  the  goal  of   all  the  observances  in  the  Torah  is  the   creation  of  a  human  being  who  will  act  lovingly  towards  all  others.  If  that   is  not  achieved,  the  observances  have  not  attained  their  goals.   What,  then,  is  a  Jew  -  a  true  Jew,  an  ideal  Jew  -  from  the  view  of  the  tradi  tion  itself?  A  person  of  humility  and  generosity,  devoted  to  the  creation  of  an  equitable,  just  society  built  on  kindness;  one  who  in  all  his  or  her  dealings  demonstrates  love  toward   others.   Yes,  there  are  formal  rules  that  govern  the  question  of  one’s  Jewish  ness,  but  far  more  important  are  the  teachings  that  define  for  us  what  it  means  to  be  a  Jew  -  a  true  disciple  of  Abraham,  of  the  prophets,  of  Hillel   and  Akiva.  That  should  be  the  con   tent  of  our  teachings  and  the  way  in  which  we  measure  Jewishness.   It  is  the  goal  of  Jewish  living,  a  goal  that  is  far  from  being  achieved,  but  worthy  of  our  best  endeavours.

"  THE  FOX  FILES   ANGIE  FOX   CCORDING  to  the  Australian  Bureau  of  Statistics  2001  cen   f~\us  there  are  89,893  Jews  liv  ing  in  Australia.  Of  those,  12  surf.  My   husband  was  one  of  them.   That  made  me  a  Jewish  surfer  widow.   Now,  my  Jewish  surfer  husband  (JSH)  wasn't  taken  by  a  shark,  or  even  swept  into  the  belly  of  a  large  whale,  as  was  the  fate  of  another  JSH,  Jonah.  He's  alive  and  sometimes  even  well.   But  there  are  many  recreational  pastimes  that  Jewish  men  traditional  ly  do  not  partake  in:  eating  pork,  working  on  the  Sabbath,  any  compli  cated  form  of  manual  labour  (ie  changing  a  tyre  or  light  globe),  or  activities  involving  gardening  shears  and  lawnmowers.  At  least  not  well,  anyway.   And,  apparently,  Jewish  men  don't  surf.  So  it  seemed  my  unfortunate  lot  in  life  to  be  saddled  with  a  JSH.  Imagine  the  litany  of  extra  worries  a  Jewish  surfer  widow  has  to  bear.   First,  there's  the  obvious  threat  of  shark  attack.  My  brave  and  daring  JSH  was  terrified  of  them  and  it  took  hours  of  therapy,  hypnosis,  and  seri  ous  cajoling  on  my  part  to  convince  him  to  even  dip  his  toes  into  Australia's  treacherous  waters.   With  one  in  three  Australians  grappling  skin  cancer,  my  JSH's  melanomas  prompted  sunscreen  issues:  it  was  always  dripping  into  his  eyes  causing  them  to  itch  and  sting.   I  shmeared  countless  brands  and  varieties,  from  non-greasy  to  spray-on  and  super  unleaded,  onto  his  ultra  sensitive  skin,  but  nothing  worked.   The  prohibitive  cost  of  surfing  was  yet  another  worry  I  was  burdened  with.  Unfortunately  I  couldn't  claim  the  chiropractor,  acupuncturist,  Chinese  herbalist  and  feldekreist  quack  on  my  health  insur  ance,  but  without  them  my  JSH's  neck  would  be  in  perpetual  spasm.   Of  course,  I  was  then  forced  to   drive  everywhere  because,  naturally,  it  is  dangerous  to  operate  heavy  machinery  when  one  cannot  turn  one's  head  to  the  left  ...  or  right.  Which  gave  rise  to  one  of  life's  great  est  ironies:  they  [husband]  make  you  [wife]  drive,  and  then  yell  at  you  for  nearly  mowing  down  pedestrians,  touch-parking  and  scratching  every  available  panel  on  the  side  of  any  pil  lar  or  post  within  a  10-kilometre   radius.   Even  with  health  insurance,  the  dentist  fees  -  to  heal  his  ailing  jaw,  a  result  of  referred  neck  and  shoulder  pain  -  were  exorbitant.   But  what  really  kept  me  up  at  night  was  the  constant  stress  that  one  day,  while  wiling  away  the  hours  at  home  cooking,  cleaning,  starching  his  wetsuits  and  picking  up  the  shabbes  candles  -  which  he  used  to  wax  his  surfboard  -  I  would  receive  the  call.  No,  not  that  call.  The  call  I  was  dread  ing  was  from  his  grandmother.   ""Ver  is  he?""   ""Surfing.""   ""Oh  my  poor  baby  he  must  stop  viz  deez  games.""   You  see  I  can  ask  him  to  stop  leav  ing  bits  of  used  dental  floss  on  the  coffee  table,  or  beg  him  to  clip  his  toenails  over  the  bin  and  not  the  couch,  but  when  nanna  commands,  he  jumps.   And  as  much  as  his  surfing  riled  me,  I  dreaded  the  pain  of  having  him  around  the  house  all  the  time.   Sixteen  snapped  boards  and  countless  stained  rash  shirts  later  (apparently  you  aren't  supposed  to  mix  whites  and  colours)  my  fears  were  realised.   He's  got  a  new  hobby  now:  Sony  PlayStation  soccer.   That  makes  me  a  Jewish  PlayStation  widow.   Because  when  he  plays  it,  he  may  as  well  be  brain  dead.

"  Jewish  comedy  scoops   pool  at  German  awards   TOBY  AXELROD   BERLIN  -  When  Germany’s  new  Jew  ish-themed  comedy  reaped  the  most  nominations  for  the  country’s  highest  film  awards,  hardly  anyone  was  more  surprised  than  the  film-maker  him   self.   Now  Go  For  Zucker  has  swept  the  awards,  winning  six  prizes  including  best  film,  best  director  and  best  actor.   The  best  film  award,  announced  earlier  this  month,  carries  a  prize  of  about  $US600,000.   Swiss-born  director  Dani  Levy,  47,   has  had  moderate  success  in  Ger  many,  but  never  a  hit  film.   “For  me,  it’s  a  miracle,”  he  said.   Go  For  Zucker  outpaced  Downfall  a  dark  film  about  Hitler’s  last  weeks,  in  the  race  for  the  top  awards.   Go  For  Zucker  is  a  comedy  about  an  extended  family  in  which  fervent  Orthodoxy  is  pitted  against  ultra  assimilation,  the  communist  against  the  unscrupulous  businessman,  the  lesbian  against  the  Chassid  and  the  boy  against  the  sexy  cousin.   What’s  funny  about  the  conflict  between  former  East  and  West  Ger   many  played  out  through  the  eyes  of  Jews?  And  what’s  funny  about  a  Jewish  gambling  addict  who  blames  his  fail   ures  on  antisemitism?   Everything,  it  seems.   “Naturally,  Jews  always  know  how  to  laugh  over  themselves.  It’s  in  our  nature,”  said  Levy,  who  now  lives  with  his  wife  and  child  in  Berlin,  the  city   where  his  mother  was  born.  “What  maybe  is  new  here  is  that  Jews  are  pre   sented  with  self-confidence.   “The  older  generation  was  afraid  to  broadcast  such  images  of  them  selves  because  they  were  afraid  of  anti  semitism  and  prejudice.  With  the  new  generation,  these  fears  are  not  so  widespread.”   In  Germany,  a  film  has  to  appeal  to  non-Jewish  audiences  to  be  a  success,  and  this  one  does.   “You  can  watch  Zucker  and  know  nothing  about  Jews  and  still  enjoy  it,”  said  Nicola  Galliner,  the  founder  and  director  of  the  Jewish  Film  Festival  in  Berlin  which  has  been  running  for  11  years  and  thrives  on  non-Jewish  audi   ences.   “I  don’t  think  there  are  many  Ger   Director  Dani  Levy  (left)  and  Go  For  Zucker  co-writer  Holger  Franke.   man  films  on  a  Jewish  subject  that  are  lighthearted,”  she  said.   The  founder  of  the  Jewish  Cultural  Association  in  Berlin,  Irene  Runge,  said:  “I  loved  the  movie.  It  used  to  be  that  everything  about  Jews  was  always  about  the  past.  With  this  film,  German  Jews  have  fun  and  non  Jews  have  fun.   |  “One  cannot  come  to   terms  with  what   Germany  did  60  years  ago.  It  will  take  many   generations.  It  is  still  a  stigma.”   DANILEVY  Film  director   “And  I  think  you  go  out  of  the  film  with  a  more  positive  feeling,  not  like   what  we  had  before.  It’s  how  we  see  ourselves  and  that’s  what  I  like  about  it.”   There’s  a  great  curiosity  among  many  non-Jews  in  Germany  about  Jewish  life,  but  many  Germans  still  associate  Jews  with  victimhood.   Levy  suggests  that  laughter  may  be  the  best  way  to  ease  tensions  between  Jews  and  non-Jews  in  Germany.   “Laughing  at  another  group  of  people  I  have  always  found  painful,  whether  it’s  aimed  at  Jews  or  others,”  he  said.  “But  if  you  laugh  with  people,  it’s  a  sign  that  you  like  them.  In  this  film,  people  like  the  characters  and  can  suffer  with  them  and  feel  with   them.  And  I  think  that’s  always  the  best  way  to  win  people  over  and  to   cross  borders.”   Go  For  Zucker  tells  the  story  of  a  contemporary  German  Jewish  family  in  which  two  warring  brothers  -  for  merly  separated  by  the  Berlin  Wall  -  are  reunited  after  the  death  of  their  mother.  The  non-religious,  commu  nist  brother  is  addicted  to  gambling;  the  Orthodox,  capitalist  brother  is  a  real-estate  tycoon.   Through  a  comedy  of  errors,  the  characters  rediscover  each  other’s  essential  humanity.  In  the  process,  their  own  prejudices  -  and  those  of  the  audience  -  are  systematically  exposed  and  blasted.   Normality  between  Jews  and  non  Jews  in  Germany  is  elusive,  for  good  reason,  according  to  Levy.   “One  cannot  come  to  terms  with   what  Germany  did  60  years  ago.  It  will  take  many  generations.  It  is  still  a  stigma,”  he  said.   Alongside  the  attempts  to  under  stand  the  past  is  a  tendency  to  “min  imise  it”,  Levy  explains.  “And  I  see  Downfall  as  one  that  somehow  tries  to  rehabilitate  the  past:  there  was  this  one  bad  guy,  and  the  others  just  joined  in.   “Today  there  is  a  kind  of  longing  for  the  past.  The  Germans  see  them  selves  as  a  land  of  victims,  which  I  can  also  understand.   “People  were  bombed  and  soldiers  who  were  not  Nazis  were  dragged  into  the  war.  It’s  terribly  gruesome.  And  I  think  it’s  important  to  give  room  to  those  ‘forbidden  feelings’  and  to  look  at  those  sides  of  German  history  that  were  taboo.  It’s  a  healthy  development.”   JTA   Go  For  Zucker  is  scheduled  to  screen  in   Australia  later  this  year. ",2005-07-29

SOFIA  -  Bulgaria’s  highest  court  opened  hearings  this  week  on  a  legal  claim  for  restitution  of  Jewish  property  in  down   town  Sofia.   The  organisation  of  Bulgar  ia’s  Jews  -  Shalom  -  is  claiming  the  ownership  of  nearly  half  the  land  on  which  a  hotel  has  been  built  in  the  heart  of  the  capital.   In  1943,  the  Bulgarian  gov  ernment  confiscated  all  Jewish  property,  including  land  owned  by  the  Sofia  Israelite  Synagogue  Trusteeship  -  Shalom’s  prede  cessor.  The  government  built  the  Rila  Hotel  about  15  years  later  on  the  site  of  a  former  Jew  ish  school.   Shalom  leader  Emil  Kalo  said  the  land  should  be  compensated  to  help  support  Bulgaria’s  8000  Jews,  many  of  whom  are  elderly.  The  hotel  property  is  now  val  ued  at  about  $A40  million,  he  said.

"  NEW  THOUGHS  FOR  OLD  JEWISH  QUESTIONS     COUNTERPUNCH  --------------------------------   DVIR  ABRAMOVICH   LAST  week,  my  wife  and  I  had  dinner  with  Gary,  an  old  friend  from  my  university  days.  He  had  been  dating  a  non-Jewish  woman  for  about  two  years,  and  by  all  accounts  was  intent  on  marrying  her.   Yet,  he  recently  broke  it  off.  “Why?”  I  asked.  “I  just  couldn’t  think  of  raising  my  children  as  Catholics,”   he  said.   It  took  me  a  while  to  realise  that  in   some  recess  of  his  soul,  Gary’s  Jewish  roots  were  remarkably  and  profound-  ly  embedded,  enough  to  lead  him  to  rediscover  his  sense  of  religion,  affirm  his  identity  at  a  life-changing  moment  and  decide  that  it’s  impor-  tant  to  marry  within  the  faith.   Still,  for  every  Gary  there  are  hun-  dreds  who  don’t  engage  in  this  self  examination,  who  view  religion,  as  Stephen  L  Carter  notes  in  The  Culture  of  Disbelief,  as  a  hobby  rather  than  as   a  serious  commitment.   Indeed,  one  of  the  most  pivotal  and  tangled  questions  for  Jews  today  is  -  why  stay  Jewish?  And  can  Judaism,  in  a  post-millennium  age,  be  remade  to  accommodate  changing  demographics  and  trends?  Can  it  be  made  more  feminist,  eco-friendly,  holistic,  appealing  and  still  deeply  rooted  in  the  Jewish  past?   There  is  little  question  that  in  the  last  decade  a  real  sense  of  spirituality   has  emerged  in  the  way  Judaism  is  per-  ceived,  taught  and  practised.  But  the  unanswered  question  for  increasing  numbers  of  Australian  Jews  is  whether  today’s  brand  of  Judaism  is  enough  to  sustain  the  Jewish  community  beyond  another  generation  or  two.   Since  there  are  no  limits  to  inte-   gration,  no  limits  to  intermarriage,  it’s  hard  to  keep  people  within  their  own  group,  or  from  falling  in  love.   Seeing  portents  of  self-destruction,   Emil  Fackenheim  in  his  1987  book   What  is  Judaism?  asserts  that  fidelity  to   ancient  traditions  is  one  of  the   anchors  of  the  Jewish  faith,  though  his  daring  comments  may  not  hold  for  most  Jews.  Ask  yourself  how  many  Jews  you  know  subscribe  to  this  view.  Having  spent  a  month  in  Israel  over  the  holidays,  I  realise  more  than  ever  that  in  Israel,  religion  is  an  either/or  proposition.  For  Israelis,  religion  sig-   nifies  a  battle  between  moderates  and  hardliners,  between  ultra-Orthodox  rabbis  and  trendy  Tel  Aviv  secularists.   Australian  Judaism  still  has  tremendous  vibrancy,  but  it  must  be  strengthened  to  the  point  where  most  Jews  don’t  feel  they  are  exempt  from  caring  about  it.  For  me,  the  spiritual  treasures  of  Judaism  are  not  the  exclusive  interest  of  one  sector  of  the  community.   As  long  as  only  “religious”  Jews  are   seen  to  be  interested  in  such  rudi-   mentary  precepts  as  the  Sabbath,  kashrut,  morality  and  modesty,  there  will  be  many  Jews  who  will  not  only  be  shut  out,  but  who  will  be  disen-  franchised.     Australian  Judaism  still   has  tremendous   vibrancy,  but  it  must  be  strengthened  to  the   point  where  most  Jews  don’t  feel  they  are   exempt  from  caring  about  it.     The  secular  majority  needs  to  know  that  Judaism  does  not  belong  only  in  the  yeshivot  and  the  syna-  gogues.  Our  religion  is  a  wondrous,  fascinating  civilisation  with  inscrutable  power,  joy  and  vitality,  and  it  is  this  dimension  that  must  be  stressed  and  shown  again  and  again.   For  people  standing  on  the  margins  of  Jewishness,  who  find  Judaism  as  a  religion  too  constricting  or  old-fash-  ioned,  a  way  of  entry,  of  connecting,  can  provide  many  gems  and  a  ray  of  hope  that  their  Jewishness  is  not  lost.   For  if  there  is  one  thing  the  Jewish   community  needs  it  is  a  revival  of  interest  and  a  turn  away  from  indif-   ference.   In  devising  coherent,  effective  strategies  for  the  future,  Judaism  needs  to  be  returned  to  the  people.  Judaism  should  be  made  relevant  and  exciting  and  should  not  be  presumed  to  apply  only  to  one  group.   To  meet  the  challenges  of  the  brave  new  world,  we  need  to  think  creative-  ly,  to  invent  a  new  language  that  seri-  ously  and  imaginatively  speaks  to  the  next  generation  and  affirms  and  solidifies  their  Jewish  identity.   Values  such  as  family,  morality  and  charity  should  be  spotlighted  as  the  cornerstones  of  Judaism.  We  need  to  find  a  path  that  rejuvenates  and  addresses  Judaism  not  just  from  the  head,  but  also  from  the  heart.  Judaism  cannot  be  preserved  solely  on  the  basis  of  memories  and  hopes  -  it  must  be  actively  practised.

"  Bolivia’s  small  Jewish  community  seeks  escape   JOE  GOLDMAN   LA  PAZ  -  The  political,  social  and  ethnic  crisis  in  Bolivia  is  taking  a  toll  on  the  country’s  small  Jewish  community.   The  landlocked  Andean  nation  practically  ground  to  a  halt  last   month  in  the  face  of  nationwide   protests  that  cut  off  food  and  gas  supplies  from  the  major  cities.   The  indigenous  people,  who  make  up  the  bulk  of  Bolivia’s  pop  ulation  of  eight  million,  are  demanding  more  say  in  the  gov  ernment  and  calling  for  national  isation  of  natural  gas  fields.   “The  first  major  effect  of  this  long  situation  is  the  fact  that  one  has  to  live  in  a  world  of  great  uncertainty,”  said  Gabriel  Herc  man,  institutional  director  of  Cir  culo  Israelita,  the  main  Bolivian   Jewish  organisation.  “Our  chil  dren  cannot  go  to  school  because   it  isn’t  safe  to  travel.   Hercman  says  there  are  only  about  600  Jews  left  in  Bolivia  -  half  of  them  in  La  Paz  -  down  from  a  high  of  around  2000  in  the  1950s.  The  protests  could  acceler  ate  Jewish  emigration,  Hercman  predicted.   “Many  Jews  have  left  the  coun  try.  Some  have  gone  to  Israel  but  most  have  immigrated  to  the  United  States,”  he  said.   Because  of  the  unrest,  Israel  evacuated  its  citizens  from  Bolivia  early  last  month.   Two  dozen  Israeli  trekkers  were  airlifted  to  Peru,  and  approximately  150  Israelis  marooned  at  a  hotel  in  La  Paz,  the  capital,  were  evacuated.

"  Ms&amp;Baoks   Israeli  film  Live  and   Become  reveals  squalid  conditions  In  the  Sudan.   Jewish  films  span  the  world   DANNY  GOCS   FILMS  from  12  countries  -  includ   ing  Israel,  France,  Hungary,  Amer  ica  and  Germany  -  feature  in  this  year’s  Festival  of  Jewish  Cinema  which  opens  in  Sydney  next  week.   The  strong  state  of  the  Israeli  film  industry  is  reflected  in  the  number  of  films  -  including  inter  national  co-productions  -  in  the  festival,  led  by  the  opening-night   movie  Live  and  Become.   Directed  by  Romanian-born  Radu  Mihaileanu,  who  is  best  known  for  his  1998  comedy  Train  of  Life,  the  drama  was  inspired  by  Operation  Moses  that  saw  thou  sands  of  Falashas  (Ethiopian  Jews)   airlifted  to  Israel.   Seizing  an  opportunity,  a  non  Jewish  mother  sends  her  son  to  join  the  exodus.  Placed  with  liber  al  adoptive  parents,  the  boy  is  named  Shlomo  (and  struggles  not  only  with  his  secret,  but  with  life  in  a  new  country  and  culture).   The  acclaimed  2004  film   Campfire,  which  won  five  Israeli  Academy  Awards,  is  a  drama  set  in  Jerusalem  about  a  recently-wid   owed  mother  who  wants  to  start  a   new  life  by  joining  a  religious  set   tlement  in  the  West  Bank.  How   ever,  her  rebellious  teenage  daugh  ter  sets  out  to  sabotage  her  plans.   American  actor-turned-direc   tor  Liev  Schreiber’s  Everything  is  Illuminated  is  based  on  Jonathan   Safran  Foer’s  novel  about  a  young  American  searching  for  his  Ukrainian  Jewish  roots.   The  film  (which  opens  in  cine  mas  after  the  festival)  is  set  against  the  backdrop  of  the  mass  murder  of  Jews  during  the  Nazi  occupa  tion  as  a  young  American  (played  by  Elijah  Wood)  tries  to  find  the  Russian  shtetl  where  his  grandfa   ther  was  bom.   Fateless  is  Hungary’s  highest  grossing  independent  film  and  is  in  the  running  for  an  Oscar  for  best  foreign  language  film  at  next  year’s  awards.   Set  in  1944,  Fateless  tells  the  story  of  a  14-year-old  Jewish  boy  from  Budapest  who  finds  himself  swept  up  by  the  Nazi  round-up  and  is  sent  on  a  harrowing  journey  to  the  concentration  camps.   Thanks  to  the  friendship  of  strangers,  he  survives,  but  faces  new  challenges  when  he  returns   home  after  the  war.   Another  powerful  film  is  Israeli   director  Amos  Gitai’s  2004  drama  Promised  Land,  which  is  named  after  a  brothel  in  Haifa  and  deals  with  the  white  slave  trade  where   women  from  Eastern  Europe  are  sold  into  bondage  in  Israel.   With  its  bleak  depiction  of  Israeli  society,  Promised  Land  is  a  disturbing  film.  It  was  screened  earlier  this  year  at  the  Melbourne   International  Film  Festival.   French  director  Arthur  Joffe’s   Comic  drama  In  the  French  film  Local  CallI   Local  Call!  is  a  comedy  about  a  Paris  professor  who  finds  his  life  turned  upside  down  by  a  meeting  with  an  old  girlfriend.   Among  the  documentaries  being  screened  at  the  festival  are  a  German  film  on  Swedish  diplomat  Raoul  Wallenberg  titled  Saviour  and  Victim,  an  Israeli  film  about  Jewish  communities  in  North  Africa  during  World  War  II  titled  A  Matter  of  Time,  and  Stalin's  Last  Purge,  which  recounts  the  fate  of  Soviet  Jewry  in  Stalinist  Russia.

JMed,  will  provide  both  social  and  professional  needs  for  Jewish  medical  students  and  jun  ior  doctors,  contacts  for  school  and  university  students  interest  ed  in  studying  medicine,  and  also  assistance  placing  students  in  Israeli  hospitals  for  their  elec   tives.   ""JMed  fills  an  important  gap  in  our  community's  structures,""  said  JMed  founding  president  Simon  Nothman.   ""Unfortunately  these  days  there  are  fewer  Jewish  students  studying  medicine,  with  some  students  being  the  only  Jews  in  their  year  group.  JMed  allows  Jewish  students  and  junior  doc  tors  at  different  universities  and  hospitals  to  discuss  issues  of  con  cern  and  helps  them  make  important  professional  contacts   in  their  chosen  field.""

"  I  Jewish  words  that  kill   Jewish  terrorism  can  no  longer  be  considered  a  passing  phenonmenon.   ISRAELI  1  DOWN  UNDER'   CHEMI  SHALEV   A   Jewish  terrorism  stems  from  the  cesspool  of  extremist,   fundamentalist,  right  wing  ideology.   READERS  of  the  Melbourne   edition  of  the  Australian   Jewish  News  got  a  relative  ly-mild  sample  last  week  of   the  kind  of  rampant  rhetoric  used  in  recent  months  by  opponents  of  the  Gaza  pullout.  In  a  full-page  advertisement  in  this  newspaper,  35  rabbis,  mostly  from  Chabad,  described  the  disengagement  as  “suicidal  surrender”.  It  is  “forbid  den”,  the  rabbis  pronounced,  for  anyone  to  participate  in  the  with  drawal,  or  even  to  endorse  it.   No,  the  advertisement  did  not  call  for  violence,  neither  did  it  preach  terror;  nor  did  any  of  the  rabbis,  settler  leaders  or  pullout  opponents  in  Israel  who,  in  recent   weeks,  have  described  Ariel  Sharon  as  a  monstrous  fascist,  IDF  soldiers  as  “storm-troopers”,  the  official  Israeli  government  policy  as  “ethnic  cleansing”  and  the  disengagement   itself  as  “the  road  to  extinction”.   But  what  is  the  19-year-old,  highly-impressionable  and  perhaps  slightly-unbalanced  mind  of  some  one  like  Eden  Natan-Zadah  to  do   with  this  harsh  portrayal  of  reality?  Jews  are,  after  all,  sworn  to  the  oath  of  “never  again”  being  led  like  “lambs  to  the  slaughter”.  If  Israel  is  on  a  certain  path  to  “suicidal  sur  render”,  as  the  rabbis  maintain,  and  no-one  is  doing  anything  about  it,  it  takes  only  a  small  leap  of  faith  to  reach  the  conclusion  that  any  act  -  even  the  slaughter  of  innocent  Israeli  citizens  in  the  peaceful  city  of  Shfar’am  -  is  legitimate,  perhaps   even  a  mitzvah.   This  is  the  warped  and  twisted  corner  that  fundamentalist  Jewish  rabbis  and  extremist  settler  leaders   have  painted  their  gullible  support   ers  into.  And  while  there  is  a  uni  verse  of  difference  between  Muslim  terror  and  Jewish  terror,  one  cannot  but  draw  comparisons  with  the  inflammatory  rantings  and  ravings   of  radical  Muslim  sheikhs  -  of  which  there  is  a  fair  share  Down   Under  -  who  praise  martyrdom  and  suicide  bombings  in  the  just  strug  gle  against  the  “Great  Satan”  Amer   ica  and  its  underlings.   In  fact,  while  the  term  “Jewish  terrorist”  thankfully  still  takes  one  by  surprise  -  it  is  not  as  oxymoron  ic  as  one  would  hope.  From  the  killing  of  Peace  Now  demonstrator  Emil  Grunzweig  in  1983,  through  the  Jewish  underground  and  its  murderous  rampage  in  the  Islamic  College  in  Hebron,  also  in  1983,  Baruch  Goldstein  and  the  Hebron  massacre  in  1994,  the  Bat  Ay  in  underground  in  2002  and  other  assorted  “Jewish  terror”  incidents  that  have  taken  place  in  the  past  two  decades,  it  is  clear  that  Jewish  ter  rorism,  while  still  rare,  is  not  a  pass  ing  phenomenon.  And  it  stems  from  the  same  cesspool  of  extrem  ist,  fundamentalist,  right-wing  ideology  from  which  both  Natan   Zadah  and  the  assassin  of  Yitzhak   Rabin,  Yigal  Amir,  drew  their  inspi   ration.   In  fact,  the  same  kind  of  poi  soned  atmosphere  and  incendiary   incitement  that  led  to  the  traumatic   killing  of  Rabin  a  decade  ago  has   been  resurrected  in  recent  weeks  as  the  disengagement  draws  near.  And  just  like  then,  the  perpetrators  accept  no  responsibility  for  the   actions  of  those  who  take  their   words  too  seriously  and  translate   them  into  action.   The  only  consolation  is  that  Natan-Zadah  -  like  many  Muslim  terrorists  before  him  -  has  probably  achieved  the  exact  opposite  of  what  he  intended.  By  his  actions,  he  has  fortified  the  resolve  of  most  Israelis  to  carry  out  the  disengagement  and  to  overcome  the  seditious  attempts  by  settler  leaders  to  undermine  it  by   force.   For  unlike  his  terrorist  predeces  sors,  Natan-Zadah  didn’t  kill  hostile   Palestinians,  but  full-fledged  and  usually  loyal  and  peaceful  Israeli  cit  izens.  The  outpouring  of  rage  at  his   act,  from  Prime  Minister  Ariel   Sharon  downwards,  has  been  gen  uine  and  heartfelt.  His  Arab  victims,  Muslims  and  Christians,  are  being  accorded  the  same  respect  and  sym  pathy  hitherto  reserved  for  Jewish   victims  of  terror.  And  while  the   lynching  of  Natan-Zadah  inside  the  bus  in  Shfar’am  has  cast  the  Arabs  in  a  negative  light,  their  overall  restraint  in  the  difficult  aftermath   of  the  terror  attack  has  been  duly  noted  by  the  Jewish  majority.  It  may  bridge  at  least  some  of  the  chasm  that  has  existed  between  the  two  communities  since  the  Arab  riots  at  the  start  of  the  second  intifada  and   the  consequent  killing  by  police  of   13  Arab  demonstrators.   So  perhaps,  as  Samson  said  in   the  book  of  Judges,  “meaz  yaza  '  matok”,  from  this  bitter  pill  some  thing  sweet  has  emerged,  and  per  haps  the  Shfar’am  murders  are  a  blessing  in  tragic  disguise.  This  would  be  comforting,  were  it  not   for  the  certainty  that  there  are  other  *  potential  Natan-Zadahs  out  there,  and  that  the  rabble-rousers,  rab  binical  and  otherwise,  are  far  from  recognising  the  errors  of  their  ways   and  words.   Chemi  Shalev,  associate  editor  of  the  AJN,  is  an  Israeli  journalist  currently   living  in  Sydney.  *  His  column  appears  fortnightly. ",2005-08-12
"  Under  pressure,  Russia   drops  probe  of  Jewish  book   LEV  KRICHEVSKYAND  SAM  SER   MOSCOW  -  Following  a  storm  of  protest  from  Jewish  groups  and  Israeli  politicians,  Russian  officials  have  dropped  a  investigation  into  a  Russian  Jewish  group  for  publishing  a  reli  gious  Jewish  book.   But  Russian  Jewish  leaders  warn  that  those  interested  in  human  rights  should  remain  vigilant  to  prevent   similar  incidents  in  the  future.   “The  fact  that  the  prosecutors  have  been  seriously  considering  that  case  for  a  long  time,  isn’t  that  a  reason  for  us  to  be  concerned?”  said  Rabbi  Zinovy  Kogan,  chairman  of  the  Con  gress  of  Jewish  Religious  Organisa  tions  and  Communities  of  Russia,  the  group  that  was  the  subject  of  the  probe.   The  investigation  was  launched  after  an  antisemitic  letter  was  circulat  ed  earlier  this  year  attacking  the  text  of  the  Shulchan  Aruch  legal  code  as   “extremist  and  anti-Christian”.  The  congress  has  published  a  short  version  of  the  medieval  Jewish  text.   The  probe  astonished  Israeli  offi  cials  and  heads  of  international  Jewish  groups,  who  said  it  reminded  them  of  religious  persecution  under  the  czar  and  of  religious  disputations  foisted  on  Jews  by  the  Catholic  Church  in   medieval  times.   Direct  pressure  on  Russia  from  Israel  and  local  and  foreign  Jewish  groups  led  to  the  decision  to  drop  the  case,  observers  in  Moscow  suggested.   Israeli  and  Russian  media  also   noted  that  the  news  on  dropping  the  probe  was  released  during  a  visit  to  Moscow  by  Israel’s  trade  minister,  Ehud  Olmert.  Olmert  was  in  Moscow   Leonid  Nevzlin  ...  antisemitism  will  only   V  increase.  Photo:  JTA   for  talks  on  economic  relations  between  the  two  countries.   Among  those  who  condemned  Russian  authorities  for  even  entertain  ing  the  complaint  was  Leonid  Nevzlin,  a  former  president  of  the  Russian  Jew  ish  Congress,  who  today  serves  as   chairman  of  the  board  at  the  Tel  Aviv  Diaspora  Museum  after  fleeing  prose   cution  in  Russia  as  a  senior  member  of  oil  giant,  Yukos.   “This  current  incident  proves  that  the  increase  of  antisemitism  in  Russia   is  inevitable,”  Nevzlin  said.  “Today’s  Russia  is  once  again  under  the  influ  ence  of  its  secret  services;  members  of  the  old  regime  are  once  again  in  posi  tions  of  power  [and  they]  have  brought  with  them  the  ‘classic’  anti  semitism  that  characterised  Russia  during  the  Soviet  period,”  he  said.   Powerful  people  in  President  Vladimir  Putin’s  government,  Nevzlin  continued,  “don’t  hesitate  to  openly  express  their  antisemitic  attitudes.  I  believe  that  such  cases  of  anti  semitism  in  Russia  will  only  increase   and  worsen  in  the  future.”   Kogan,  who  was  editor  of  the  Russ  ian  edition  of  the  Kitzur  Shulchan   Aruch,  was  questioned  by  legal  offi  cials  several  times  this  year.   During  questioning  last  week  at  the  prosecutor’s  office,  Kogan  said  he  had  to  make  a  statement  that  Jews  and  Judaism  do  not  have  any  claims  against  Christianity.  He  said  that  he  was  surprised  to  find,  among  materi  als  in  the  case,  testimony  by  an  aca  demic  expert  claiming  that  Judaism  regards  Christians  as  idol  worshipers.  “If  we  do  not  expose  such  myths,  the   attacks  on  us  will  continue,”  Koean   said.

"  Phil  Green  ....  debuts  at  128  in  BRW’s  Rich  200  list.   Cardboard  king  Richard  Pratt...  donates  $1  million  a  month  to  charities,  many  of  them  Jewish.   Rags  to  riches   dominates  Jewish  tales  in  Rich  200   MELISSA  SINGER   THEY  don’t  call  it  rags  to  riches  for  nothing.  At  least  two-thirds  of  the  30  or  more  Jewish  entries  on  this  year’s  BRWmagazine  Rich  200  list  are  immi  grants,  many  of  whom  arrived  in  Aus  tralia  with  little,  if  anything.   Nine  Poles,  all  of  whom  are  Jewish,  and  six  Hungarians  appear  on  this  year’s  list.  There  are  also  six  each  from  South  Africa  and  England,  some  of  whom  are  Jewish.  Altogether  61  immi  grants  rank  among  the  country’s  rich  est  200  people.   Many  of  them,  including  Australia’s  richest  Jew,  Czechoslovakian-born  Westfield  chief  Frank  Lowy,  fled  Nazi  occupied  Europe.  Lowy,  74,  with  $4.8  billion  —  up  $600  million  on  2004  —  occupies  second  position  on  this  year’s  list  behind  media  tycoon  Kerry  Packer,  whose  fortune  increased  by  a  lazy  $400  million  to  $6.9  billion.   In  third  place  is  cardboard  king  Richard  Pratt  -  his  company  Visy  Industries  turns  over  more  than  $3  bil  lion  annually  -  with  $4.7  billion,  an  increase  of  $500  million  for  the  70  year-old  Melburnian  whose  family   fled  Poland  on  the  eve  of  WWII.  Stable   in  fourth  position  is  Meriton  boss  and  self-confessed  workaholic,  Harry  Triguboff,  72,  on  $2  billion.   Climbing  from  seventh  to  sixth  this  year,  John  Gandel  turned  around  a  $300-million  decrease  in  2004  to  increase  his  fortune  this  year  by  $100  million  to  $1.5  billion.   While  it  was  a  richer  year  across  the  board,  Australia’s  wealthiest  family,  the  Smorgons,  experienced  a  $70-million   slide  to  $2.3  billion.  The  Libermans  ranked  number  two  with  $1.6  billion  with  the  Besens  in  third  spot  at  $1.2  billion,  taking  the  combined  wealth  of  the  nation’s  three  richest  families  to  $5.1  billion.  Also  included  in  the  fami  ly  listings  were  the  Saunders  family  ($655m),  the  Scheinberg  family  ($295m)  and  the  Roth  family  ($204m).   Although  the  rich  are  getting  richer,  the  Jewish  names  on  the  list  also  repre  sent  some  of  the  community’s  most  dedicated  philanthropists.  Pratt  and  Lowy  each  contributed  $1  million  towards  the  Boxing  Day  tsunami  relief  fund  and  Gandel  donated  $1  million  to  the  new  Yad  Vashem  museum.   However,  it  was  mixed  fortunes  for  some  of  the  other  Jews  on  the  list,  which  began  in  1983.  Phil  Green,  the  managing  director  of  Sydney  invest  ment  firm  Babcock  and  Brown  and   governor  of  Sydney’s  Jewish  Commu  nal  Appeal,  debuted  at  number  128  with  $218  million  -  one  of  21  new  names  on  the  list.   But  Australian  Reebok  boss  Aaron  Hendler,  former  Tempo  boss  John  Schaeffer  and  Israel-based  former  World  Jewish  Congress  senior  vice  president  Isi  Leibler  all  dropped  off  the  list  (the  latter,  according  the  magazine,  because  he  has  transferred  investments  to  Israel).  The  only  other  departure  was  shopping  centre  magnate  and  phi  lanthropist  Isador  Magid,  who  died  last  November,  aged  91  and  whose  wealth  ($250  million)  has  been  trans  ferred  to  the  family  list.

"  Costello,  US  Jewish  leader   to  spearhead  JCA  campaign   DAN  GOLDBERG   LAST  year  it  was  Prime  Minister  John  Howard;  this  year  it’s  his  political  bridesmaid,  Federal  Treasurer  Peter  Costello,  who  will  launch  the  Jewish  Communal  Appeal  (JCA)  campaign.

JCA  appeal  chairman  Peter  Ivany  told  the  AJN:  “Mr  Costello  has  been  a  strong  supporter  of  the  Sydney  Jewish  community  through  the  JCA  and  because  of  this  we  were  eager  to  invite  him  to  join  us  for  a  second  time.  We  are  delighted  that  he  agreed  to  be  part  of  our  2005  campaign.   “The  major  donor’s  dinner  pays  tribute  to,  and  recognises,  the  impor  tance  of  this  special  group  of  leaders  and  the  vital  contribution  they  make  to  the  local  community  via  their  sup  port  of  the  JCA  through  a  minimum  donation  of  $25,000,”  said  Ivany,  who  took  over  the  post  from  Barry  Smor  gon  late  last  year.   Costello,  a  long-standing  ally  of  the  Australian  Jewish  community  and  staunch  supporter  of  Israel,  forged  his  alliance  with  the  Jewish  community  when,  as  a  student  in  Melbourne  in  the  1970s,  he  defended  Israel’s  right  to  exist  against  a  groundswell  of  pro  Palestinian  solidarity.   Costello  will  be  joined  at  the  func  tion  by  David  Harris,  the  executive  director  of  the  American  Jewish  Com  mittee  (AJC).  Since  his  appointment  in  1990,  Harris  has  been  head  of  America’s  most  powerful  Jewish  rep  resentative  organisation.  He  oversees  300  staff  in  33  offices  across  the  US   representing  125,000  members  and   supporters.   Harris’  activism  in  the  1970s  led  him  to  be  twice  detained  and  later   expelled  by  the  Soviet  authorities  when  he  was  campaigning  on  behalf  of  Soviet  Refuseniks.  His  role  in  help  ing  free  more  than  one  million  Soviet  Jews  who  emigrated  to  Israel  and  else  where  earned  him  the  first  Lifetime  Achievement  Award  from  the  Russian  Jewish  community  in  the  US.

""I  decided  that  a  trip  to  Israel  was  too  good  an  opportunity  to  miss,  so  I  went  and  stopped  in  Nam  on  the  way  home,""  Burnett  explains.   The  trip  is  part  of  the  US-based  Charlie  Awards,  run  by  the  Lynn  Schusterman  Family  Foundation.  It  is  for  young  Jews  who,  after  going  on  a  birthright  israel  program,  take  an   active  role  in  Jewish  life  in  their  respective  communities.  The  nine  day  trip  aims  to  inspire  participants  to  become  stronger  activists  in  their  local  Jewish  communities.   ""We  meet  with  soldiers,  volun  teer  in  Israeli  community  programs  and  were  given  US$1800  to  donate   to  Israeli  and  local  charities  of  our  choice,""  Burnett  says.   Burnett  was  the  only  Australian  in  his  group.  The  other  participants  were  from  Argentina,  Russia,  the  Ukraine,  Canada,  the  US,  Spain  and  Denmark.  The  week-long  trip,  held  this  January,  began  in  the  Negev  and  finished  in  Jerusalem.  The  group  was  presented  with  awards  at  the  Knesset  and  partook  in  the  birthright  mega-event  —  a  celebra  tion  attended  by  young  Jews  from   around  the  world.   ""Our  group  clicked  straight  away,  we  all  talked  about  the  issues  in  our  various  communities  and  how  these  could  be  overcome.  One  of  the  ideas!  came  back  with  was  to  create  a  greater  focus  on  charity  within  AUJS,""  says  Burnett.   Burnett  became  involved  with   AUJS  after  returning  to  Australia  from  their  Academy  program.  He  helped  organise  social  functions  and   his  active  role  led  fellow  AUJS  mem  bers  to  nominate  him  for  the  Charlie  Award.  His  involvement  in  AUJS  will  continue  in  2005  as  he  has  been   appointed  NSW  social  officer  and  AUJS  president  for  Sydney  University   where  he  studies  Arts  and  Law.   ""A  lot  of  Jews  are  disconnected  and  there  is  always  more  room  for  helping  Israel;  working  with  AUJS  gives  that  common  goal,""  Burnett  explains.   Although  Burnett  had  been  involved  with  Hineni  and  had  some  Jewish  friends,  it  was  only  when  he  graduated  from  Killara  High  School  in  2003,  and  decided  to  go  to  Israel  that  he  developed  a  sense  of  com  munity  spirit.   ""I  didn't  know  many  Jewish  kids  during  my  school  years,  I  thought  going  away  with  Jewish  people  my  age  was  a  great  way  to  see  Israel,  it  made  me  want  to  get  involved,""  says  Burnett,  who  grew  up  in  the   David  Burnett,  the  19-year  old  winner  of  a  Charlie   Award  and  an  all-expenses  paid  trip  to  Israel.

Even  after  three  trips  to  Israel,  Burnett  is  far  from  tired  of  it.  He  is  considering  participating  in  the  annual  AUJS  Leadership  Development  Program,  where  par  ticipants  visit  Israel  and  Eastern  Europe  with  the  aim  of  strengthen  ing  young  Jewish  leadership  within  the  Australian  Jewish  community  as  well  as  ties  with  world  Jewry.   ""I  urge  everyone  to  get  involved  in  Jewish  community  activities  and  char  ities,  especially  ones  that  are  connect  ed  to  Israel,""  says  Burnett.   ""Besides  being  a  reward  in  them  selves,  there  are  free  trips  to  Israel  to  be  gained."" ",2005-02-04
"  Students  from  Noor  Al  Houda  Islamic  College  and  Moriah  College,  role-playing  to  breakdown  stereotypes.   Jewish,  Muslim  and  Catholic   students  find  common  around   SV1ARK  FRANKLIN   BRING  together  a  bunch  of  teenagers  from  an  Islamic,  a  Jewish  and  two  Catholic   schools,  and  what  do  you  get?  An  ordinary  bunch  of  teenagers,  socialising  wildly  like  any  group  of  adolescents  invariably  does.   But  the  25  students  from  Kincoppal  High  School,  Moriah  College,  Gilroy  College,  and  Noor  Al  Houda  Islamic  College  were  particu  larly  enthusiastic  when  they  met  this  week,  because  they  had  a  rare  opportunity.   It's  not  often  they  get  to  hang  out  with  other  kids  their  own  age,  who  think  in  similar  ways  to  themselves  and  face  similar  challenges  in  life,  yet  who  come  from  completely  different  backgrounds.   ""Never  in  my  whole  life  had  I  spoken  to  a  girl  with  a  headscarf  on,""  said  Natalie  Wicks,  a  Year  11  student  at  Moriah  College,  which  hosted  the  student  inter-faith  event.   After  giving  goodbye  hugs  to  three  Islamic  girls  who  she  spent  the  last  two  days  with  -  sharing  deeply-felt  opinions  and  exchanging  stories  from  their  different  lives  -  she  reflected,  ""For  me  it  just  broke  down  all  of  the  stereo  types.  I  didn't  think  they'd  be   so  cool.""   ""That's  the  point  of  this  program,""  said  Michelle  Brenner,  a  conflict-resolution  consultant  who  teamed  up  with  Forum  on  Australia's  Islamic  Relations  (FAIR)  direc  tor  Kuranda  Seyfi  Seyit  to  organise  the  event.   ""Just  through  meeting  each  other  and  through  talk  ing  they've  broken  down  a  lot  of  cultural  barriers.""   The  two-day  event  -  the  first  student  inter-faith  meet  ing  on  such  a  scale  in  NSW  -  was  funded  by  the  Department  of  Immigration,  Multiculturalism  and  Indigenous  Affairs  as  part  of  its  Living  in  Harmony  initia   tive.   It  was  designed  to  break  down  cultural  stereotypes  and  establish  more  intimate  connections  between  stu   dents  of  different  religions.  Utilising  role-play,  open  forums,  and  storytelling,  the  meeting  also  aimed  to  devel  op  the  students'  conflict  resolutions  skills.   ""Each  person  makes  assumptions  about  people  based  on  what  they  know  through  the  media  and  else  where,""  Seyit  said.  ""It's  not  until  you  start  looking  at  other  people's  individual  sto  ries  that  you  begin  to  under  stand  them  properly.""   While  moderating  the  final   session  on  Monday  after  noon,  which  addressed  media  narratives  about  reli  gion,  guest  presenter  Ben  Weiss  said:  ""Your  cultural  identity  gives  you  a  lens  through  which  you  see  the  world,  but  in  a  society  which  has  lots  of  cultures,  you   sometimes  need  a  different  lens.""   Year  9  Muslim  student  Mahmoud  Kamaledine  said:  ""Before  I  came  here  I  didn't  really  know  much  about  Jewish  people.  You  hear  a  lot  of  negative  stuff  about  Jews,  but  the  Jewish  people  I  have  met  here  seem  really  great.""   Year  11  Moriah  student   Carly  Fenton  said:  ""It's  really  important  when  we  go  back   to  our  different  areas  and   hear  people  talking  ignorant  ly  about  other  religions  or  other  cultures,  that  we  make  sure  to  correct  them  or  maybe  show  them  a  different  point  of  view.""   Seyit  said  he  hopes  the  event  will  lead  to  other  larger  initiatives:  ""We  need  to  start  building  a  movement,  not  just  leave  it  as  a  one-off  event.  And  the  best  people  in  society  to  do  this  are  the  youth  because  they  don't  have  any  of  the  baggage  that  so  many  other  people  in  society  have."" ",2005-09-23
"  Jewish-Catholic  relations:   40  years  after  Nostra  Aetate   IT  is  no  hyperbole  to  describe  the  statement  known  as  Nostra  Aetate  as   the  most  dramatic  transformation  ever  witnessed  in  the  course  of  human  history.  With  this  stirring  introduction,  Rabbi  David  Rosen  delivered  a  message  from  Jerusalem  to  Australia’s  Jewish  and  Catholic  communities  this  week,  300  representatives  of  which  were  due  to  gather  at  Sydney’s  Great  Synagogue  to  celebrate  the  40th  anniversary  of  that  historic   document   Proclaimed  by  Pope  Paul  VI  on  October  28,1965,  Nostra  Aetate  (Latin  for  “In  Our  Time”)  absolved  the  Jewish  people  of  the  charge  of  killing  Jesus  -  overturning  2000  years  of  Catholic  Church  doctrine  -  and  condemned  all  forms  of  antisemitism.  The  statement  was  a  watershed  in  Jewish-Catholic  relations,  foreshadowing  a  relationship  based  on  mutually-respectful  dia  logue  and  steadily-improving  inter-faith  cooperation.   The  enormity  of  Nostra  Aetate  stems  from  the  fact  that  for  2000  years  the  Jewish  people  had  been  condemned  and  demonised  by  the  Christian  world  -  culminating  in  the  unparalleled  crime  of  the  Holocaust  The  charge  of  deicide,  of  which  the  Jews  stood  (falsely)  accused,  was  erased  by  this  historic  document  As  a  result  of  this  changed  outlook  on  the  part  of  the  Catholic  Church  and  the  consequent  improvement  in  relations  between  the  Jewish  and  Catholic  peoples,  three  landmark  events  took  place:   •  John  Paul  II  became  the  first  pope  to  visit  a  synagogue  when  he  addressed   an  overflowing  Rome  Synagogue  in  1986,  using  the  occasion  to  describe  the  Jews  as  a  dearly  beloved  elder  brother  of  the  Catholic  Church;   •Full  relations  between  the  Vatican  and  the  State  of  Israel  were   established  in  1993;  and   •  John  Paul  II  became  the  first  pope  to  visit  Israel,  in  2000,  and  visited  the  Yad  Vashem  Holocaust  Memorial  and  the  Western  Wall,  where  he  inserted  a  prayer  which  he  had  composed  on  behalf  of  the  world’s  one  billion  Catholics,  seeking  God’s  forgiveness  “for  the  behaviour  of  those  who,  in  the  course  of  history,  have  caused  these  children  of  yours  to  suffer”.   THAT  encapsulates  the  power  of  Nostra  Aetate  -not  just  the  document   itself,  but  the  historic  events  which  became  possible  because  of  it  It  is,  therefore,  just  cause  for  celebration,  and  the  ceremony  at  the  Great  Syn  agogue  is  but  one  of  a  series  of  events  being  held  around  the  world  to  cele  brate  the  document  and  the  transformation  which  it  is  still  ushering  in.  Indeed,  the  most  significant  event  will  be  the  first  state  visit  by  a  president  of  Israel  to  the  Vatican,  due  to  take  place  next  month  when  Moshe  Katsav  visits  the  Holy  See  in  Rome.  Thankfully,  the  new  pope,  Benedict  XVI,  has  a  history  of  inter-faith  involvement  and  has  committed  himself  to  maintaining  the  legacy  of  his  predecessor,  John  Paul  II.   Here  in  Australia,  Nostra  Aetate  has  been  compounded  by  healthy  dialogue  between  the  two  communities.  Only  last  month,  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  celebrated  its  20th  anniversary  here.  Among  its  founders  were  sev  eral  rabbis,  including  Sydney’s  Raymond  Apple  and  Melbourne’s  John  Levi  and  the  late  Ronald  Lubofsky.  They,  together  with  their  Catholic  counter  parts,  have  built  strong  bridges  between  the  two  communities,  such  that  Aus  tralia  has  been  described  as  an  international  benchmark  in  inter-faith  relations  between  Catholics  and  Jews.   Cardinal  Edward  Cassidy,  who  was  the  former  president  of  the  Pontifical  Council  for  Christian  Unity,  will  underscore  the  importance  of  inter-faith  ties  in  these  troubled  times  when  he  delivers  his  speech  to  the  Australian  gather  ing.  “We  have  the  same  God,  our  moral  values  have  the  same  source  in  the  Torah  or  Old  Testament,  we  have  the  same  understanding  of  this  world  in  which  we  live.  Our  new  spirit  of  friendship  and  caring  for  one  another  may  be  the  most  important  symbol  that  we  have  to  offer  our  troubled  world.”   The  five-part  Nostra  Aetate  document  also  refers  to  relations  with  Mus  lims,  Hindus  and  Buddhists.  But  it  was  its  Jewish  component  that  was  so  sig  nificant,  given  the  historic  hostility  that  had  existed  between  the  two  faiths.   Now,  40  years  on,  diplomatic  relations  exist  between  the  Vatican  and  the  Jewish  State,  religious  leaders  on  both  sides  share  common  ground  and  the  notion  that  relations  between  Jews  and  Catholics  could  plunge  into  deep  freeze  is  today  virtually  unthinkable  -  thanks  to  the  power  of  Nostra  Aetate,  and  the  important  inter-faith  work  which  has  been  subsequently  undertaken,  including  here  in  Australia.

"  KIWI  ELECTIONS   ‘Ripple’  of  Jewish   opposition  to  Clark   MARK  FRANKLIN   ONLY  a  “ripple”  of  opposition  has  emerged  from  New  Zealand’s  Jewish  community  ahead  of  this  Saturday’s  federal  election  in  reaction  to  per  ceived  anti-Israel  sentiment  from  Helen  Clark’s  Labour  government.   That’s  according  to  New  Zealand  Jewish  Council  president  Stephen  Goodman,  who  described  the  com  munity’s  ill  feeling  towards  Clark  in  the  wake  of  her  frosty  attitude  to  Israel  as  “a  ripple  rather  than  a  groundswell”.   “Some  people  who  have  in  the  past  been  strong  supporters  of  Helen  Clark  are  now  only  very  mild  sup  porters,  and  a  few  have  begun  sup  porting  the  National  Party,”   Goodman  said.   However,  one  member  of  Auck  land’s  Jewish  community  took  out  a  full-page  advertisement  in  the  latest  edition  of  the  New  Zealand  Jewish  Chronicle,  calling  for  a  change  of  gov   ernment.   “Before  you  vote  remember  the  past  six  years,”  says  the  advertisement,  highlighting  tensions  that  have  erupt  ed  between  Clark’s  government  and  Israel,  including  New  Zealand’s  100  per  cent  record  of  voting  against  Israel  in  the  United  Nations,  and  For  eign  Minister  Phil  Goff’s  controver  sial  meeting  with  Yasser  Arafat.   Clark  froze  diplomatic  relations  with  Israel  last  year  in  response  to  a   Part  of  the  full-page  advertisement  In  the  September  edition  of  the  New  Zealand  Jewish  Chronicle.   scandal  in  which  two  alleged  Israeli  Mossad  agents  were  convicted  of  fraudulently  trying  to  obtain  a  Kiwi  passport.  Only  two  weeks  ago,  Israeli  Ambassador  to  New  Zealand  Nati  Tamir  formally  resumed  diplomatic   ties.   New  Zealand  Jewish  Chronicle  edi  tor  Mike  Regan  said  the  advertise  ment  is  in  no  way  a  gauge  of  the  New  Zealand  Jewish  community’s  pre  election  mood.  “Certainly  there  are  groups  of  people  who  feel  that  Clark  treated  Israel’s  alleged  spies  badly  ...  But  [sentiment]  is  no  different  now  than  it  was  three  years  ago.”   Clark’s  Labor  government  is  run  ning  neck-and-neck  against  the  National  Party’s  Don  Brash,  who  is  believed  to  be  a  strong  supporter  of   Israel.   With  only  6636  Jews  counted  in  New  Zealand’s  2001  census,  the  Jew  ish  community’s  votes  are  unlikely  to  significantly  impact  the  result. ",2005-09-16

ORTHODOXJEW   RIVQA  BERGER   THE  automatic   response  to  danger   is  fear.  So  when   things  happen  in  Israel,  particularly  as  prominent  as  the  war  against   Hezbollah,  natu   rally  my  thoughts  turn  to  my  safety  and  that  of  my  family.  As  a  modem  Orthodox  woman,  I  cover  my  hair  and  I’m  never  sure  how  visibly  Jewish  I  am,  particularly  to  a  savvy  anti   semite.  And  I  must  admit  that  it  has   occurred  to  me  to  ask  my  husband  to  stop  wearing  his  kippa.  But  to  do  that   would  mean  that  terror  has  been  suc   cessful.  That’s  why  he’ll  keep  wearing  his  kippa,  and  I  always  wear  a  Magen  David  necklace.  So  although  I’m  afraid  sometimes,  overall  I’m  prouder  than  ever  to  be  Jewish.   It  has  occurred  to  me  to  !  ask  my  husband  to  stop  I  wearing  his  kippa.  But  to  |  do  that  would  mean  that   j  terror  has  been   successful.   On  a  day-to-day  basis,  I’ve  been  less  afraid  for  my  safety  and  more  con  cerned  about  how  to  respond  to  my  left-wing  work  colleagues.  So  for  it  hasn’t  come  up,  but  if  anything,  the  past  weeks  have  crystallised  my  staunch  support  for  Israel,  albeit  with  occasional  criticisms  of  certain  actions.  I  feel  confident  that  Israel  has  the  moral   high  ground.  Regardless  of  how  Hezbollah  might  claim  this  as  a  victory,  I  believe  that  in  the  long  term,  Israel  will  win  and  bring  peace  with  victory.

"  DEFINITION  OF  A  JEW   SELWYN  Suchet  dedares  that  it  was  Hitler  who  determined  that  we,   Liberal  and  Orthodox,  are  all  Jews  {AJN  8/12).   While  I  agree  with  his  inclusive  sentiments,  I  take  exception  to  the  notion  that  it  is  Hitler’s  philosophy  that  defines  who  is  a  Jew.  It  is  also  a  fact  that  being  born  to  a  Jewish  mother  is  never  initiated  by  the  child  and  consequently  it  is  not  something  that  the  child  can  be  proud  of  having   achieved.   I  would  like  others  to  define  me  as  a  Jew,  if  they  think  of  me  as  someone  who  is  honest  in  his  business  dealings,  who  tries  to  pursue  justice,  and  who  does  not  put  a  stumbling  stool  in  front  of  the  blind.  The  issues  of  driv  ing  to  shul  on  Friday  night  and  keep  ing  kosher  are  matters  for  God.   Hillel  put  it  more  succinctly  by  defining  Judaism  as  a  philosophy  that  dictates  that  a  Jew  should  not  do  to  others  what  he  finds  abhorrent.  He  made  no  mention  of  Balaam,  Pharaoh,  Haman  or  Antiochus.   DR  ANDREW  GAL   Double  Bay,  NSW ",2006-12-15

The  meeting,  described  as  “emo  tional”  by  onjppkersr.included  Abdul's  revelation  of  her  Jewish  background.  “Not  many  people  know,  but  both  my  parents  are  Jewish.  I  am  very  excited  about  telling  you  this,”  she  told  Herzog.   Her  father,  turns  out,  is  a  Syrian  Jew  who  immigrated  to  Brazil  -  hence  the  name  Abdul  -  while  her  mother  is  a  Jew  from  Canada.   According  to  somewhat  suspect  spin-doctors  at  the  Israeli  consulate  in  Los  Angeles,  Abdul  was  “close  to  tears”,  hugging  Heizog  and  telling  him,  “You  have  helped  make  a  dream  come  true.""   Asked  about  the  potential  shidduch,  Abdul  -  actress,  singer  and  choreogra  pher  -  replied  like  a  good  Jewish  girl:  “As  long  as  my  parents  are  happy?  she  said.

"  Australian  Jew  sues  Israel   RUTH  EGLASH   Jerusalem  -  An  Israeli-born  Aussie  busi   nessman,  Ronnie  Shachar,  is  suing  the  Israeli  Interior  Ministry  after  he  was  denied  entry  to  Israel  last  week.   He  was  eventually  allowed  in,  but  only  after  a  good  friend  posted  a  $A9000  bond  for  him  at  the  ministry  and  he  promised  to  provide  documents  proving  his  Jewishness.   Shachar,  36  -  who  does  not  hold  an  Israeli  passport  -  tried  to  enter  Israel  via  the  Allenby  Bridge  from  Jordan  as  he  had  previously  done,  by  his  count,  more  than  150  times.  Shachar  is  charging  that  his  rights  as  a  Jew  seeking  to  enter  Israel  were   violated  and  the  incident  caused  him  much  emotional  distress.   The  Interior  Ministry,  however,  said  that  due  to  the  amount  of  time  Shahar  spends  in  Israel,  he  was  no  longer  eligible  to  enter  the  country  merely  on  a  tourist  visa.  ‘The  centre  of  his  life  is  in  the  State  of  Israel  and  he  is  no  longer  seen  as  a  tourist  A  person  cannot  keep  entering  and  re-entering  Israel  .on  a  tourist  visa  without  end,”  explained  Sabine  Haddad,  the  spokeswoman  for  the  Interior  Ministry's  population  registry.

He  chose  to  pray  for  the  welfare  of  the  American  Government,  both  in  Eng  lish  and  Hebrew,  a  sign  of  his  strong  Jewish  identity.   Bolten  was  named  last  week  as  Bush’s  second  chief  of  staff.  He  suc  ceeds  Andrew  Card,  who  served  more  than  five  years  in  the  post.  The  move  comes  amid  low  approval  rat  ings  for  the  administration  and  calls  from  both  parties  for  new  leadership   at  the  White  House.

Before  this  week’s  appointment,  he  served  as  director  of  the  White  House  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  a  Cabinet-rank  position,  and  as  a  domestic  policy  adviser.   Colleagues  and  friends  say  Bolten  has  been  vocal  about  his  religion  and  willing  to  participate  in  Jewish  events  at  the  White  House.  He  frequently  has  been  seen  at  White  House   Chanukah  candle-lightings,  and  par  ticipated  in  a  megillah  reading  at  the  White  House  during  Purim  this  year.   He  has  also  been  a  quiet  advocate  for  Jewish  concerns,  say  Jewish  organisational  officials,  sometimes  bringing  issues  past  the  White  House  bureaucracy  and  straight  to  influen  tial  leaders,  like  Karl  Rove,  the  presi  dent’s  deputy  chief  of  staff  and  political  adviser.   “Since  the  beginning  of  this  administration,  he  has  been  a  senior  level  force  for  making  sure  the  Jewish  community  had  a  voice  at  the  very  highest  levels  of  the  administration,”  said  William  Daroff,  vice-president   for  public  policy  at  United  Jewish  Communities,  the  umbrella  organi  sation  of  the  North  American  federa  tion  system.   “Josh  Bolten,  as  chief  of  staff  to  the  president,  will  open  up  great  opportunities  for  the  Jewish  commu  nity  to  make  sure  we  are  heard,”   Daroff  added.

"  Two-Jew  music  trio  to  commence  tour   NICOLE  BRESK1N   THE  Macquarie  Trio  Australia  (MTA)  begins  its   national  tour  next  week.   The  ensemble  is  made  up  of  Jewish  mem  bers  Kathryn  Selby,  who  plays  the  piano,  and  cellist  Michael  Goldschlager,  who  will  perform  with  violinist  Michael  Dauth.  They  will  play  in  Sydney,  then  Canberra,  Melbourne,  Brisbane   and  Adelaide.   This  tour,  called  Towers  of  Power,  will  consist  of  Beethoven,  Brahms  and  Bach  compositions.   Selby  describes  the  Beethoven  and  Brahms  numbers  as  “heavy  hitters.  We’ve  played  them  before  and  they’re  very  popular,”  he  said.   The  Bach  number  is  a  new  one  for  the  group  and  Selby  promises  it  will  be  “a  very  powerful  piece"".   Selby  founded  the  company  as  a  musician  in-residence  at  Macquarie  University  in  1993.   ""I  thought  it  would  be  a  great  idea  to  have  an  ensemble-in-residence,”  she  says.   The  company  started  with  a  performance  at  Macquarie  University,  and  expanded  to  the  city  in  1994,  Melbourne  in  1998,  and  Canberra  in   2000.   ""We’re  going  national,  because  there  is  a  need  for  it,”  said  Selby.  ""We  can’t  fit  any  more  people  in  small  venues  and  we  don’t  want  to  go  to  a  larger  venue.  We  want  to  stay  intimate.”   As  a  trio,  Selby  says  the  group  involves  “three  soloists  trying  to  speak  as  one”.   Goldschlager  moved  from  New  York  to  Australia  in  1985,  first  performing  with  the  West  Australia  Symphony  Orchestra,  later  joining  the  MTA  in  1993  shortly  after  it  was  formed.  He  began  his  career  at  the  Chamber  Music  Society  of  Uncoln  Centre  in  New  York.  Sydney-born  Selby,  trained  at  the  Sydney  Conservatorium  of  Music.  They  are  slated  to  perform  in  a  national  five-concert  series  this  year.   The  MTA  has  recorded  seven  albums  for  ABC’s  Classics  series.   “Recording  is  wonderful  because  you  can  hear  what’s  happened  and  learn  from  it  later  but  nothing  beats  the  immediate  feedback  from  the  audience,”  she  added.

"  A  JEW  WHO  PLAYS  THE  JEWISH  BLAME  GAME     Is  Norman  Finkelstein  a  self-hating  Jew  or  a  critic  with  an   uncomfortable  kernel  of  truth?  BEN  NAPARSTEK  talks  to  the  controversial  author.     NORMAN  Finkelstein  is  the  aca-  demic  equivalent  of  a  street  fighter.  An  anti-Zionist  crusader  who’s  also  the  child  of  Holocaust  survivors,  he  regularly  likens  Jewish  officials  to  antisemitic  stereotypes  and  has  labelled  Holocaust  survivor  writer  Elie  Wiesel  as  the  “resident  clown”  of  the  Holocaust  “circus”.   He’s  a  far-left  academic  with  a   strong  support  base  among  the  Holo-  caust-denying  right.  One  Jewish  intel-   lectual  has  described  him  as  “a   disgusting  self-hating  Jew”.   Finkelstein  rose  to  notoriety  in  2000  with  The  Holocaust  Industry:  Reflections  on  the  Exploitation  of  Jew-  ish  Suffering,  which  argued  that  organised  Jewry  exploits  the  memory   of  the  Holocaust  to  deflect  criticism  of  Israel  and  blackmail  European  governments  for  compensation  payments.   Finkelstein’s  tract  was  initially  ignored  in  the  United  States,  but  was  translated  into  17  languages  and  spent  nine  months  on  Germany’s   bestseller  lists.   In  Finkelstein’s  latest  book,  Beyond  Chutzpah,  he  argues  that  American  Jewish  leaders  wield  the  club  of  anti-  semitism  to  silence  critics  of  Israel.   “By  turning  a  blind  eye  to  Israeli  crimes  in  the  name  of  sensitivity  to  past  Jewish  suffering,  [Jewish  leaders]   enable  Israel  to  continue  on  a  mur-   derous  path  that  foments  anti-  semitism  ...  Alongside  Israel,  they  are   the  main  fomenters  of  antisemitism  in  the  world  today,”  he  writes.   The  latter  half  of  the  book  is  given  over  to  attacking  Harvard  legal  scholar  Alan  Dershowitz’s  2004  best  seller  The  Case  For  Israel,  an  attack  that  led  to  a  fierce  campaign  by  Der-  showitz  to  stop  the  publication  of   Finkelstein’s  new  book.   Finkelstein  makes  no  pretence  about  his  academic  credentials,  brag-  ging  that  he’s  never  been  published  in  an  academic  journal  and  teaches  at  a  “third-rate  university”  in  Chicago  because  he  was  “kicked  out  of  every  job”  in  New  York.  But  reasoned  objec-  tivity  is  not  his  aim,  for  Finkelstein  is  an   angry  man.  Writing  is  his  therapy.   “The  only  reason  I  ever  write  any-  thing  is  because  I  get  so  angry  I  start  screaming  at  the  pages,”  he  says.   “My  breath  gets  short  and  I  start  walking  around.  It’s  just  all  lies!  Rather  than  having  it  locked  up  inside  of  me,  I  write  it  out.”   For  his  supporters  -  most  promi-  nently,  friend  and  mentor  Noam  Chomsky  -  Finkelstein  is  a  bold  icon-  oclast,  prepared  to  speak  the  unspeakable  about  questions  long  sidelined  by  political  correctness.   In  his  recently-published  book  The  Case  for  Peace,  Dershowitz  argues  that  Chomsky  uses  Finkelstein  as  a  “hit  man”  to  voice  his  hard-left  per-  spective  on  Jewish  issues,  which  Chomsky  has  avoided  ever  since  his  name  became  tarnished  by  his  associ-   ation  with  Holocaust  deniers.   However,  Finkelstein  says  that  he  is  untroubled  about  his  work  being   criticised.   “In  World  War  II,  Thomas  Mann  went  on  radio  constantly  denouncing  the  Nazi  regime  and  they  all  said,  ‘That’s  giving  comfort  to  anti-teu-   Norman  Finkelstein  ...  prepared  to  speak  the  unspeakable.     tonic  feeling’.  I’m  sure  there  are  peo-  ple  who  are  gleeful  that  a  Jew  is  stick-  ing  it  to  the  Jews.   “But  you  have  to  say,  ‘Well,  who  are  the  main  victims  now?  Is  it  Jews  or  Palestinians?’  If  my  writing  can  miti-  gate,  even  in  a  small  way,  the  suffering  Palestinians  have  to  endure,  and  if  it  gives  some  comfort  to  a  handful  of  kooks  and  loonies,  then  I  think  that  price  is  acceptable.”   If  Finkelstein  was  concerned  about   being  a  neo-Nazi  pin-up,  he  wouldn’t  use  Nazi  Germany  as  his  most  persist-   ent  analogy  for  Israel  and  the  Ameri-  can  Jewish  lobby.   For  Finkelstein,  the  outrage  that  greets  his  work  proves  his  argument  that  Jewish  officials  deploy  the  stereo-  type  of  the  eternal  Jewish  victim  to   immunise  themselves  from  criticism.   “If  you  were  to  say  American  actions  in  Iraq  caused  a  lot  of  anti-  American  feeling,  would  anyone  think  twice  about  it?  But  if  you  say  that  the  Jews  and  the  Jewish  State  cause  anti-  Jewish  feeling,  everybody  calls:  ‘Hor-  ror!  That’s  blaming  the  victim.’” ",2006-01-13
"  DAN  GOLDBERG  AND  IdORIN  BLUEV2ENIHAL   A  TURF  war  has  erupted  between  the  Jewish  House  Crisis  Centre  and  JewishCare  over  who  cares  for  NSW  Jews  in  crisis.   The  war  of  words  began  late  last  month  when  JewishCare  wrote  to  Jew  ish  House  about  the  full-page  advertis  ing  campaign  that  Jewish  House  has  launched  in  the  AJN.   In  a  letter  received  by  Jewish  House  on  November  3,  obtained  by  the  AJN,  JewishCare  CEO  Mark  Schlosser  wrote:  “We  are  very  concerned  that  your  current  campaign  suggests  that  the  Jewish  House  has  a  professional  capacity  to  respond  to  and  assist  peo  ple  in  crisis  24  hours  a  day.  Our  under  standing  of  your  staffing  and  resources  suggests  this  simply  is  not  the  case.”   But  Jewish  House  officials  hit  back,   accusing  JewishCare  of  refusing  to  dis  cuss  cases  referred  to  by  Jewish  House.  One  Jewish  House  psychologist  was  allegedly  told  that  JewishCare  cannot  meet  her  until  the  management  sort  out  their  spat.   Jewish  House  general  manager  Ruth  Abras  claimed  this  week  she  had  received  correspondence  from  Jewish  Care  accusing  the  advertisements  of  being  “misleading”  and  having  “the  potential  to  sour  our  relationship”  with  JewishCare.   She  responded  to  Warren  Hurst,  community  relations  manager  at  Jew  ishCare,  saying:  “Both  organisations  help  people  in  need  in  the  community  on  different  levels  and  the  community  is  the  only  beneficiary  of  our  compli  mentary  services  and  cooperation.”   JewishCare  is  a  constituent  of  the  Jewish  Communal  Appeal  (JCA)  and   is  celebrating  its  70th  anniversary.  Jew  ish  House  was  founded  by  Roger  Clif   ford  in  1984  and  is  not  a  member  of  the  JCA.   Clifford  told  the  AJN  from  Los  Angeles  this  week  he  was  “really  upset”  about  the  attack.  “No  bureau  cracy  should  stand  in  the  way  of  peo  ple’s  welfare  -  ever,”  he  said.   JewishCare  president  Eva  Fischl  declined  to  comment  on  the  stoush.  But  a  source,  who  spoke  on  the  con  dition  of  anonymity,  said  several  community  leaders  had  voiced  con  cerns  about  Jewish  House’s  lack  of  accountability.  Jewish  House  was  founded  22  years  ago  by  Clifford  and  his  brother  Anthony.  Its  annual  budg  et  is  around  $600,000,  which  it  raises  at  one  annual  fundraiser  -  on  November  30  -  and  through  private  fundraising. ",2006-11-10
"  ‘I  felt  vulnerable  as  a  Jew   Last  Saturday’s  pro  Lebanese  rally  in   Sydney's  CBD  was   one  of  the  largest  in   the  world.  JOEL  LABI  joined  the  throng.   MORE  than  15,000  people  packed  into  Sydney’s  CBD  last  Saturday,  the  majority  of  them  of  Muslim  faith,  Lebanese  decent  or  left-wing  socialis   tic  views.   I  attended  the  rally  as  a  reporter  for  a  local  radio  station,  but  as  a  Jew  I  felt  it  was  an  obligation  to  understand   how  those  on  the  other  side  of  the   ledger  felt,  and,  more  so,  I  hoped  to  hear  pledges  towards  making  the  region  a  peaceful  place.   But  the  rally  preached  hatred,  not  peace.  And  what  surprised  me  was   the  number  of  Australian  Christians   who  draped  themselves  in  Palestinian  flags.  Others  displayed  signs  reading   “Israelis  are  the  new  Nazis”.   Chants  were  soon  concocted  on   top  of  a  mobile  stage  by  Australia’s  mufti,  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly,  to  the  tunes  of  “Down,  Down  Israel”,  with  the  crowd  passionately  engulfed  in  what  was  to  be  the  slogan  for  the  day.

Photo:  AP/AAP   Greens  Senator  Kerry  Nettle  spoke  of  Israel’s  unwillingness  to  cooperate,  and  other  speakers  labelled  the  Jewish  State  as  the  real  terrorists.  To  my  shock,  they  even  condoned  Hezbol   lah’s  continual  bombardment  of  Israel’s  northern  cities  and  towns.   The  rally  back-flipped,  and  had  now  assumed  a  pro-terrorism  stance.   As  we  moved  towards  Martin   Place,  chants  were  sung  in  Arabic   about  the  destruction  of  Israel.   Muslim  spokespeople  publicly   announced  their  hate  for  the  Zionist   state,  and,  in  a  double  blow,  proceed   ed  to  direct  their  attention  to  the   “biases”  of  my  radio  station,  which  forced  my  colleague  to  hide  her  microphone.   I  attended  because  I  believed  a   message  of  peace  would  be  heard,  but  the  rally  carried  a  harmful  message  which  was  shared  by  virtually  all  who   attended.  And  it  made  me  feel  more   vulnerable  as  a  Jew.   When  a  crowd  of  15,000  people  chants  for  the  destruction  of  your  country,  it’s  easy  to  see  how  they  want   this  to  end.

"  APPLE  ADVOCATES  JEWISH  PROSELYTISING     MARK  FRANKLIN     WORLDWIDE  Jewry  should  actively  seek  to  convert  people  to  Judaism  pro-  viding  it  is  done  sensitively,  according  to  the  rabbi  emeritus  of  Sydney’s  Great  Synagogue,  Raymond  Apple.   Delivering  this  controversial  mes-  sage  in  an  address  last  month  at  Jerusalem’s  Bet  Yosef  Synagogue,  Rabbi  Apple  described  Judaism  as  “an  endangered  species”.   “In  terms  of  general  policy  I  believe  it  is  time  for  us  to  try  to  bring  people  into  Judaism  both  for  the  sake  of  Judaism  and  for  the  sake  of  the  world,”  Rabbi  Apple,  who  served  at  the  Great  Synagogue  for  32  years  until  last  year,  told  the  AJN  this  week  from  Jerusalem.   “There’s  been  a  long  tradition  over  centuries  that  we  accept  converts  but  we  don’t  go  looking  for  them,  so  the  only  way  this  policy  I  advocate  could  work  is  if  there  was  a  gradual  seeping  through  of  this  attitude  throughout  the  Jewish  world.  It  is  not  something  that  rabbis  or  Jewish  leaders  could  impose  as  a  whole.”   But  his  suggestion  has  drawn  a  mixed  response  from  other  rabbis.   Central  Synagogue’s  Rabbi  Levi   Rabbi  Raymond  Apple:  “I  believe  it  is  time  for  us  to  try  to  bring  people  into  Judaism  both  for  the  sake  of  Judaism  and  for  the   sake  of  the  world.”  Photo:  AJN  file     Wolff  agreed  that  Jews  “should  be  seeking  to  encourage  those  who  have  a  genuine  and  deep  interest”  in  Judaism,  but  added  that  “seeking  converts  is  not  something  that  has  been  part  of  Jewish  ideology  in  the  past  and  should  not  be   so  in  the  future”.   Jewish  tradition  requires  rabbis  to  discourage  converts  in  order  that  they  prove  their  sincerity  by  returning  three  times  before  being  accepted  as  candi-  dates  for  conversion.  But  although  Jews  -  unlike  Christians  or  Muslims  -  have  never  proselytised,  there  are  apparently  no  halachic  prohibitions  on  doing  so.   Rabbi  Moshe  Gutnick,  a  dayan  (judge)  at  the  Sydney  Beth  Din,  told  the  AJN:  “I  can  find  nowhere  in  the  sources  that  I’ve  checked  of  an  obliga-  tion  to  [proselytise],  but  I  don’t  neces-  sarily  find  a  prohibition  to  do  so  either.   “We  are  obligated  to  force  the   world  to  believe  in  one  God  and  to  observe  the  seven  Noachite  laws.  If  in  the  course  of  that  exercise  a  gentile  decides  that  he  wants  to  become  Jew-  ish,  that’s  fine  and  we  accept  it.”   Rabbi  Apple  said;  “I  believe  that  there  are  many  people  in  the  world  who  would  bring  a  great  deal  of  poet-  ry  and  morality  into  their  lives  if  they  observed  Shabbat,  lit  candles  on  Chanukah,  built  a  succah  and  had  a  seder.   “I  think  what  we  should  be  looking  for  is  people  who  will  bring  strength,  not  just  demography,  to  Judaism,  and  people  who  will  benefit  from  it.   “We  have  always  been  a  small  peo-  ple;  we  are  likely  to  remain  small,  but  what  is  more  important  is  quality  not  quantity,”  he  said.

"  Alleged  French  gang  leader  Youssouf  Fofana,  25,  prime  suspect  In  the  grisly   murder  of  llan  Hailml,  is  escorted  handcuffed  by  two  plainclothes  policemen  on  the  gangway  of  a  Paris-bound  plane  at  Abidjan  airport.  Photo:  AAP   French  dispute  murder  of  Jew  was  antisemitic   BRETT  KUNE   PARIS  -  While  Jews  here  are  agonis  ing  over  the  torture  and  murder  of  Ilan  Halimi,  some  French  remain  convinced  that  the  barbaric  crime  was  not  antisemitic.   The  kidnapping  and  murder  has  been  declared  an  antisemitic  act  by  Interior  Minister  Nicolas  Sarkozy,  but  also  a  violent  crime  whose  motive  was  money.   Since  Halimi,  23,  was  found  tor  tured  in  a  suburban  train  station  February  13  and  died  on  the  way  to  the  hospital,  the  affair  has  been  the  talk  of  France,  often  in  very  critical   terms.   The  alleged  leader  of  the  gang,  Youssouf  Fofana,  has  been  extradit  ed  from  the  West  African  nation  of  Ivory  Coast,  where  his  parents  were  bom.  Most  but  not  all  of  the  sus   pects  arrested  by  police  are  of  Arab   North  African  or  black  African  Mus  lim  origin.   Although  Fofana  has  told  police  that  the  kidnapping  involved  only  money,  other  suspects  said  they  tried   to  kidnap  Jews  because  “all  Jews  are  rich”,  and  they  put  cigarettes  out  on  Halimi’s  face  because  “he  was  Jewish  and  we  don’t  like  Jews”.   But  “the  fact  that  the  suspects  said  that  all  Jews  are  rich  does  not  mean  a  thing”,  said  Sylvain  Francois,  a  video  editor  at  French  television.  “Accord  ing  to  what  we  know  now,  I  don’t  think  it  was  antisemitic.  It  was  cheap,  violent  crime.”   “This  was  more  an  idiotic  act  than  an  antisemitic  one,”  comment  ed  Gerard  LeMoelle,  a  French  televi  sion  journalist.  “This  is  not  classic  antisemitism  of  the  extreme  right  or  the  extreme  left  as  we  know  it  here  in  France,  so  it  can’t  be  antisemitic.”   Many  in  the  Jewish  community  are  fed  up.  “You  can  turn  this  around  anyway  you  want,  but  the  bottom  line  is  that  most  French  people  do  not  give  a  damn,”  said  Michael  Seb  ban,  an  author  and  high  school  phi  losophy  teacher  in  a  tough,  northern  suburb  of  Paris.  “Most  French  peo  ple  just  don’t  give  a  damn  about  Jews   -or  Arabs’   m ",2006-03-10

"  NO  SECULAR,  JUST  JEWISH   IAN  Bersten  {AJN  8/9)  correctly  sus  pects  that  I  do  not  recognise  as  a  legit  imate  group  of  the  community  one  that  does  not  recognise  the  authority  of  the  Sydney  Beth  Din.   Authentic  Judaism  makes  no  dis  tinction  between  religious  and  secular.  We  are  taught  that  the  first  question  to  be  asked  of  a  Jew  when  he  leaves  this  world  is:  “how  did  you  conduct  your  business;  were  you  strictly  honest?”   Governments  can  only  properly  recognise  minorities  in  terms  of  their  religion,  ethnicity  or  culture.   Religion  seems  self  evident,  but  is   far  from  it  when  we  look  at  Scientol   ogy  and  suchlike.  Ethnicity  is  incon  gruous  as  applied  to  Jews:  “ethnic”  was  coined  to  apply  to  non-Christian  and  non-Jewish  heathens  and  pagans.   “Culture”  is  etymologically  rooted  in  the  Latin;  “cultus”  which  means  worship;  hence  a  “cult”  is  the  worship  of  a  person  or  thing.  Jews  never  had  a  “culture”  that  was  not  strictly  rooted  in  Torah.  Much  that  passes  as  “Jewish”  today  is  borrowed  from  a  variety  of  Diaspora  communities.  How  can  you  recognise  as  “Jewish”  a  third-genera  tion  Australian  secularist  with  a  Jewish  father?   There  are  over  a  million  Israeli  Arabs;  some  are  secularists,  Hebrew  speaking,  culturally  Israeli;  are  they  better  “Jews”  than  Australian  secular  ists  bom  of  Jewish  mothers?

"  Poles  support  Jewish  museum   DINAH  A  SPRflZER   WARSAW  -  Anyone  who  thinks  the  planned  $A80-million  Museum  of  the  History  of  Polish  Jews  doesn't  have  the  support  of  general  Polish  society  might  have  to   reconsider.   Eleven  leaders  from  the  country's  top  business  and  employer  associations  joined  forces  recently  to  announce  their  endorsement  of  the  museum  and  to  urge  members  to  contribute  financially.   “For  all  Poles,  the  memory  of  the  Jew  ish  people  is  part  of  the  history  of  the  Pol  ish  commonwealth  that  should  -  no,  must  -  be  remembered,  with  all  its  positives  and  negatives,”  said  Slavomir  Majman,  presi  dent  of  the  Managers  Association  in  Poland  and  a  museum  supporter.   Majman  and  his  colleagues  signed  a  petition  calling  on  businesspeople  to  make  donations  to  the  museum,  which  is  set  to  open  in  2009  but  still  is  short  of  the  millions  of  dollars  it  needs  to  fund  high  quality  exhibitions.   About  60  businesspeople  attended  the  event,  where  association  heads  said  they  would  circulate  pledge  sheets  at  their  annual  meetings.   “When  I  saw  these  guys  standing  in   front  of  the  TV  cameras,  signing  this  peti  tion  without  fear,  I  thought,  ‘Is  this  the  Poland  I’ve  been  reading  about?’”  asked  Ewa  Wieizynska,  the  museum's  deputy   director.   She  was  referring  to  media  coverage  since  the  League  of  Polish  Families,  a  party  with  a  history  of  antisemitism,  joined  the  governing  coalition  in  April,  as  well  as  other  recently  reported  antisemitic  incidents.   Museum  advocates  view  it  as  a  way  to  show  the  world  that  the  Holocaust  should  not  be  the  starting  and  stopping  point  for  those  learning  about  Polish  Jewry.   “The  museum  will  help  people  all  over  the  world  learn  not  just  how  we  died  in  Poland,  but  how  we  lived  for  nearly  1000  years,”  said  Stephen  Solender,  co-chair  man  and  president  of  the  museum’s  North  American  council.

A  simple   notice  placed  by  the  motor-vehicle  ;  bureau  in  every  Israeli  newspaper  inform  ing  all  those  driving  in  Israel  under  a  for  eign  licence  that  they  were  required  to  obtain  an  Israeli  driver’s  licence  after  tak  ing  a  simple  test.  An  Israeli  driving  test?  The  mind  boggles.   What  sort  of  test  would  you  need  to  pass  to  allow  you  to  drive  in  Israel  if  you  have  a  licence  from  anywhere  else  in  the  world?   A  test  to  me  seems  redundant,  and  the  term  over-qualified  comes  straight  to  mind.  Perhaps  they  actually  remove  courtesy  and  awareness  of  other  road  users  from  your  brain  so  that  you  then  drive  more  like  an   Israeli.   Don’t  take  this  the  wrong  way  but  Israelis  would  have  to  be  some  of  the  worst  drivers  in  the  world.  The  best  smokers,  but  the  worst  drivers.   ;:;&amp;:Tasstime  that  reverse  parking  would  be  part  of  the  test,  but  not  as  we  know  it.  For  the  Israeli  version  of  reverse  parking  you  have  to  slam  into  the  car  in  front  of  you,  then  the  car  behind  you,  then  the  car  in  front,  followed  by  the  car  behind  again.  Then  when  you  are  in  the  spot,  hit  both  cars  again  for  good  measure.  Are  you  see  ing  a  pattern  here?   Of  course  you  can  understand  the  frus  tration,  because  if  you  live  in  Tel  Aviv  chances  are  you  have  been  driving  around  the  block  where  you  live  for  45  minutes  looking  for  a  parking  spot,  and  now  that  you  have  finally  found  one,  you  face  a  half  hour  walk  to  your  flat.   Having  said  that,  us   Yiddlesback  here  in  the  Diaspora  aren’t  exactly  the  greatest  of  drivers  either;  especially  on  Friday  as  the  hours  to  Shabbat  tick  down.  There’s  something  about  a  Friday’s   impending  sunset  that  makes  grown  women  do  blind  U-turns  .across  three  lanes   of;  traffic  because   they  have  to  go  back  -  for  the  chopped  liver  they  forgot  to  buy.   Who  hasn’t  been  stuck  behind  an  alter*  riiensch  in  a  Lexus  (because  he  refuses  to  buy  German  even  though  every  taxi  in  Israel  is  a  Mercedes)  as  he  crawls  along  looking  for  a  non-existent  parking  spot?  Or  the  Yiddishe  mama  in  the  Tarago  full  of  kids  double-parked  while  young  Yossi  runs  in  to  pick  up  a  challah.  Be  warned:  if  you  are  in  a  car  in  the  “chood”  on  erev  Shabbat,  all  bets  are  off.   It’s  quite  incredible  the  way  our  skill   level  behind  the  wheel  deteriorates  as  Friday  wears  on;  the  closer  we  get  to  Shabbat,  the  worse  our  driving  becomes.  I  think  it’s  Hashem’s  way  of  telling  us  that  we  shouldn’t  drive  to  shul.   In  retrospect,  I  really  shouldn’t  knock  Israeli  drivers,  as  they  currently  supply  the  only  Jewish  driver  in  Formula  1,  Chanoch  Nissany.  Australia  has  never  had  a  Jewish  driver  in  Formula  1,  but  when  we  do,  he  should  be  easy  to  spot.  He’ll  be  the  one  with  “courier”  written  on  the  side  of  his  car.

"  A  Jewish  al-Jazeera?   THERE  are  good  reasons  for  ambivalence  about  the  fact  that  the  new  Eng   lish-language  service  of  the  Qatari-based  al-Jazeera  TV  channel  will  not  be  shown  here  on  the  widely  available  Foxtel  network,  but  only  on  the  relatively  obscure  UBI  satellite  system.

For,  love  it  or  hate  it,  al-Jazeera  has  proven  to  be  a  prime  moving  force  in  the  Arab  world,  with  critics  accusing  it  of  serving  as  a  mouthpiece  for  al  Qaeda  and  the  like,  and  its  fans  crediting  it  with  significant  liberalisation  and   democratisation  in  the  autocratic  Arab  world.

"  Anti-Zionist  Jewish  leader   MATTHEW  WAGNER   RABBI  Moshe  Halbershtam,  a  major  spiritual  leader  of  the  anti-Zionist  Edah  Haredit  com   munity,  passed  away  in  Jerusalem  Wednesday  morning  of  a  heart  attack.  He  was  74.   Halbershtam’s  death  comes  just  one  day  after  the  passing  of  Rabbi  Moshe  Teitelbaum,  the  Satmar  Rebbe,  also  a  major  spiritual  leader  of  the  Edah  Haredit  (see  opposite).   Both  men  were  distant  relatives  of  the  Sanz  Rebbe  Haim  Halbershtam,  known  as  the  Divrei  Haim,  who  lived  in  the  18th  century.  Moshe  Halbershtam  also  prayed  regularly  in  Satmar’s  Ohel  Rachel  Synagogue  in  Mea   She’arim.   Unlike  Satmar  Chassidim,  Halbershtam  was  more  open  to  Jews  outside  the  confines  of  the  Edah  Haredit,  said  David  “Duki”  Greenwald,  chairman  of  Hatzolah,  a  charedi  paramedic  organisation  that  operates  ambu  lances  and  first-aid  motorcycles  all  over  the  country.   Halbershtam,  who  specialised  in  halachic  questions  related  to  medicine,  was  Hatzolah’s   rabbi.   “He  answered  halachic  questions  on  all  sorts  of  medical  issues  and  made  sure  all  our  activities  were  in  line  with  Jewish  law,”  said  Greenwald.   “Unlike  other  rabbis  in  the  Edah  Haredit,  he  was  a  consensus  rabbi  who  answered  the  questions  of  a  diverse  group  of  religious  Jem  from  religious  Zionist  to  Sephardi,”  added  Greenwald  who  was  one  of  the  last  people  to  see  Halbershtam  alive.   “He  called  me  this  morning  complaining  of  weakness,”  said  Greenwald.  “He  looked  so  pale.  I  took  him  in  my  ambulance  and  on  the  way  he  lost  consciousness.  He  died  at  Bikur  Holim.”  Halbershtam’s  death  was  a  surprise,  although  he  had  complained  of  back  pains  and  had  been  hospitalised  in  recent  weeks.   He  is  survived  by  seven  children  and  close  to  100  grandchildren.  His  son  Zalman  is  a  rab  binic  judge  in  Williamsburg,  New  York  and  his   MOSHE  HALBERSHTAM   1932-2006   son-in-law  Ben-Zion  Deutsch  is  the  Rabbi  of  Ramat  Shlomo.   Tens  of  thousands  took  part  in  the  funeral  procession  from  Edah  Haredit  headquarters  on  Rehov  Strauss  in  downtown  Jerusalem  to  the  Mount  of  Olives,  including  Rabbi  Yosef  Shalom  Elyashiv,  the  preeminent  halachic  authority  for  Charedi  Jews  in  Israel.   In  addition  to  serving  on  the  Edah  Haredit’s  Beit  Din  (rabbinic  court),  Halbershtam  also  headed  the  Council  of  Rabbis  for  Charity  together  with  Elyashiv.   “He  worked  tirelessly  to  improve  the  lot  of  poverty  stricken  Jews”,  said  Matisiyahu  Deutsche,  Halbershtam’s  grandson,  who  said  the  charity  committee  managed  to  raise  NIS370  million  during  the  past  10  years  since  it  was  established.  “24  hours  a  day  he  was  sensi  tive  to  the  needs  of  the  poor.”   Deutsche  said  that  his  grandfather  had  at  least  500  students  who  served  as  rabbis  in  posts  all  over  the  world.   “The  Bais  Yisrael  [Rabbi  Israel  Alter  the  fifth  Gerer  Rebbe  who  died  in  1977]  once  said  of  my  grandfather  that  every  halachic  decision  he  made  received  approval  in  heaven.”   Matthew  Wagner  writes  for  the  Jerusalem  Post,   where  this  obituary  first  appeared.

"  DNA  unites  Jewish  families   SCHELLY  TALALAY  DARDASHTI   TEL  AVIV  -  Twenty-five  families,  22  of  them  now  Jewish,  have  been  identified  via  DNA  testing  as  descendants  of  a  common  paternal  ancestor  who  lived  several  hundred  years  ago.   The  families  were  connected  through  Family  Tree  DNA,  a  DNA-testing  compa  ny  with  a  large  Jewish  database.   But  a  host  of  genealogical  questions  remain:  What  was  the  time  period,  loca  tion  and  identity  of  the  common  ances  tor,  and  what  were  the  migration  routes  of  his  descendants?   Y-DNA  has  been  transmitted  from   father  to  son  for  thousands  of  years.   One  possibility  labels  the  common  ancestor  as  Sephardi.  With  the  modern  families  mostly  of  recent  Eastern  Euro  pean  descent,  that  would  challenge  their  identities  on  the  most  basic  level.   Vienna-born  electrical  engineer  Her  bert  Huebscher,  80,  of  New  York,  spear  headed  the  project,  together  with  South  African-born  Dr  Saul  Issroff,  who  now  lives  in  London.   The  Jewish  families’  origins  are  in  Galicia,  Podolia,  Crimea,  Belarus,  Lithuania  and  Latvia  -  the  Pale  of  Set  tlement;  five  are  Levites.  In  Puerto  Rico,  one  recently  learned  of  possible  Jewish  ancestry;  those  from  Germany  and  Hun  gary  suspected  it,  but  do  not  consider  themselves  Jewish.  Today,  the  families  live  mostly  in  the  United  States  and  United  Kingdom.   The  families  share  rare  anomalies  in  their  Y-DNA,  which  is  carried  only  by  males  and  doesn't  change  except  for  minor  mutations.  This  Y-DNA  is  transmit  ted  from  father  to  son,  for  thousands  of  years.   Why  just  five  of  the  families  should  be  Levites,  descendants  of  a  patrilineal  clan  that  assisted  the  Israelite  priests  during  ancient  times,  is  another  puzzle.  Huebscher  theorises  that  a  Levite  short  age  might  have  influenced  leaders  to  appoint  new  Levites,  or  some  Jews  might  have  falsely  claimed  to  be   Levites.   JTA ",2006-06-02
"  Julia  Jantsch  as  Sophia  Scholl  and  Fabian  Hinrlchs  as  Hans  Scholl  In  a  scene  from  Brelneredorfer’s  film  Sophie  Scholl.   German  Jew  celebrates  anti-Nazi  heroine  in  film   MARK  FRANKLIN   FRED  Breinersdorfer   (pictured)  is  an  eru  dite  mix  of  lawyer,  screenwriter,  crime  novelist,  playwright  and  historian.  With  a  career  spanning  each  of  these  dis  ciplines,  he  is  a  prolific  fig   ure  in  contemporary  German  culture.   In  a  rare  opportunity  to  merge  his  many  talents,  Breinersdorfer  wrote  the  screenplay  for  Sophie  Scholl,  a  new  film  about  Germany’s  most  celebrated  anti-Nazi  heroine,  which  opens  around  Australia  on  July  27.   A  2006  Academy  Award  nominee  for  best  foreign  language  film,  the  movie  has  already  scooped  four  major  honours  at  the  Berlin  International  Film  Festival  and  the  German  Film  Awards.   Scholl  and  her  famous  Nazi-resistance  group,  The  White  Rose,  have  already  been  the  subjects  of  many  movies,  but  this  latest  telling  explores  the  last  six  days  of  Scholl’s  life,  beginning  with  the  climactic  event  of  her  arrest  after  distributing  leaflets  campaigning  against  the  Nazi  regime.   In  the  tradition  of  Russian  literature,  the  film’s  narrative  is  essentially  about  resolu  tion:  specifically,  the  price  of  Scholl’s  actions.  Its  long,  theatrical  scenes  depict  her  interro  gation  by  Robert  Mohr,  the  Gestapo  agent  who  cross-examined  Scholl,  and  the  show  trial  in  which  she  and  her  co-conspirators  were  sentenced  to  immediate  death.   Breinersdorfer  worked  closely  with  direc  tor  Marc  Rothemund  in  examining  long  huried  historical  records,  including  transcripts  of  the  actual  interrogations  by  Mohr.   These  noted  the  pride,  conviction  and  stony  resolve  that  the  real-life  Scholl  dis  played  in  the  face  of  a  death  sentence  and  public  ridicule.   Wearing  their  historian  hats,  he  and  Rothemund  examined  original  leaflets  distrib  uted  by  The  White  Rose,  diary  entries  by  Scholl  and  letters  written  during  her  holiday  to  the  Black  Sea.   The  pair  conducted  extensive  interviews  in  researching  their  script  because,  as  Breinersdorfer  says,  “our  aim  was  to  make  a  film  as  true  as  possible  to  the  historical  facts”.   The  White  Rose  comprised  a  group  of  uni  versity  students,  some  of  whom  had  served  on  the  eastern  front  where  millions  of  German  soldiers  died.  They  distributed  leaflets  highlighting  the  evils  of  the  Nazi  regime,  including  its  genocide  of  Jews.   They  were  the  only  resistance  group  to  oppose  Jewish  persecution.   Tfie  film  delves  into  the  social  hegemony  of  the  time,  which  saw  ordinary  people  commit  horrific  acts.  In  one  crucial  scene,  Scholl  hurls  her  vision  of  democratic  feder  alism  against  Mohr’s  acceptance  of  Nazi  fascism.   “For  me,  it’s  the  central  scene  in  the  movie,”  Breinersdorfer  says.  “In  this  scene  you  understand  why  a  young  girl  like  Sophie   came  to  the  resistance,  and  you  understand  how  the  Nazis  and  the  Gestapo  functioned.”   His  screenplay  touches  Nietzschean  con  cepts  of  moral  versus  written  law  in  exploring  why  a  man  like  Mohr  -  in  many  ways  the  film’s  most  interesting  character  -  supports  the  Nazi  regime.   “The  yes  men,  the  people  who  followed  the  flag,”  as  Breinersdorfer  describes  them,  “are  the  really  dangerous  ones.  Without  these  Robert  Mohr  characters,  Hitler  would  have  stayed  a  postcard  painter  throughout  his   life.”   In  writing  the  film,  Breinersdorfer  relished  the  opportunity  to  examine  historical  records  and  “cast  a  small  spotlight”  on  the  question  of  how  Hitler  managed  to  convince  so  many  people  of  his  ideas.   “I  was  fascinated  to  find  these  documents  and  protocols,  to  see  what  happened  behind  the  walls  of  the  Gestapo.  This  was  the  main  point  to  refilm  the  story.   “I  was  bom  after  the  war  and  I  was  always  dealing  with  the  question  of  how  could  all  of  these  historical  catastrophes  happen  in  my  country.”   Breinersdorfer,  who  is  Jewish  by  birth,  con  fessed  that  the  temptation  to  moralise  in  writ  ing  the  screenplay  was  impossible  to  avoid.   “You  cannot  write  a  script  or  make  a  film  about  a  topic  like  this  without  moralising,”  he  says.  “We  tried  to  avoid  a  history  lesson,  but  the  intention  was  to  make  a  moral  film  and  a  political  one.”   Sophie  Scholl  opens  nationally  on  July  27.

In  the  I  mid-20th  century  Hans  Kohn  1  argued  that  the  Jew  “does  not  see  as  |  clearly  as  he  hears”.   I  But  this  does  not  mean,  notwith   standing  the  second  command  ment,  that  there  was  no  visual  art  among  Jews.  The  megillah,  for  example,  was  often  adorned  by  artistic  illustrations.  The  haggadah  frequently  became  the  object  of  artistic  ingenuity.  The  appurte  nances  used  in  the  tabernacle,  tem   ple  and  synagogue,  and  in  the  Jewish  home,  were  also  works  of  art.  When  the  Torah  says,  “This  is  my  God  and  I  will  adorn  Him”  (Shemot  15:2),  the  sages  say,  “Adorn  His  mitzvot  -  a  beautiful  succah,  a  beau  tiful  lulav,  etc”  (Shabbat  133b).   Does  this  mean  that  Jewish  art  was  limited  to  calligraphy  and  ritual  objects?  Chagall  and  Kitaj,  and  an  array  of  other  great  Jewish  artists,  prove  the  opposite  -  not  because  they  were  artists  who  happened  to  be  Jews,  but  because  there  is  a  Jewishness,  however  defined,  evident  in  their  art   Chagall  said:  “Had  I  not  been  a  Jew  I  would  never  have  been  a  painter,  or  an  entirely  different  one.

"  Israeli  sponsors  Jewish  antisemitic  cartoons   AARON  WENNER   TEL  AVIV  -  While  riots  over  the  cartoon  depic  tion  of  Mohammed  continue  to  rage  world  wide  and  controversy  surrounds  an  Iranian  newspaper's  decision  to  hold  a  Holocaust  cartoon  competition,  an  Israeli  cartoonist  has  come  up  with  his  own  ironic  -  some  say  mis  guided  -  response.  And  it’s  attracting  a  wide   audience.   Amitai  Sandy,  29,  a  Tel  Aviv  graphic  artist,  has  launched  the  Israeli  Antisemitic  Cartoons  Contest,  a  challenge,  led  by  Jews,  to  find  the  best  cartoons,  caricatures  and  short  comic  strips  that  demonise  the  Jewish  people.   ""We’ll  show  the  world  we  can  do  the  best,  sharpest,  most  offensive  Jew-hating  cartoons  ever  published!""  wrote  Sandy  on  his  website.  “No  Iranian  will  beat  us  on  our  home  turf!”   Sandy  told  the  Jerusalem  Post  that  his  intention  was  to  challenge  bigotry  by  using  humour  -  an  approach  that  officials  at  Yad  Vashem  are  not  convinced  is  the  best  idea.   “We're  not  sure  this  is  the  best  way  to  respond,”  said  spokeswoman  EstiYa’ari.   But  the  contest,  launched  on  Tuesday,  is   Logo  of  contest...  “our  home  turf”.   gamering  much  attention  worldwide,  and  already  several  cartoons  have  been  received  at  Sandy's  internet  site  -  www.boomka.org.   Sandy  is  unconcerned  that  an  Israeli  anti  semitic-cartoon  contest  would  have  negative  effects.  “People  are  afraid  that  antisemitic  propaganda  leads  to  actions,”  he  said.  “The  real  antisemites  will  do  what  they  do.  They  don’t  need  me  to  come  up  with  excuses  for   hate.”   JERUSALEM  POST ",2006-02-24
"  A  case  for  Jewish  synergy   NOBEL  prizes  have  been  given  for  less”  -  these  are  the  words  used  by   the  trendy  New  York  Village  Voice  to  describe  the  masterful  prose  of  Israeli  author  AB  Yehoshua.  Recipient  of  the  prestigious  Israel  Prize,  Yehoshua  is  almost  universally  regarded  as  a  literary  giant  of  the  Hebrew  language.   It  is  no  surprise,  therefore,  that  Yehoshua’s  ultra-Zionist  speech  to  the  cen  tennial  meeting  of  the  American  Jewish  Committee  in  Washington  last  week  has  stirred  up  a  storm  both  in  Israel  and  among  Jews  in  the  Diaspora.  His  messages  -  that  only  in  Israel  can  one  experience  the  “totality”  of  being  Jew  ish  and  that  Diaspora  Jews  “change  their  nationalities  like  jackets”  -  have  elicited  harsh  condemnation,  alongside  a  bit  of  support,  around  the  Jewish   world.   Yehoshua  has  since  apologised  for  the  tone  of  his  remarks  -  but  not  for  their  essence.  In  his  defence,  Yehoshua  stated  that  he  has  been  saying  exactly  the  same  thing  for  decades.  But  in  life,  as  Yehoshua  well  knows,  timing  is  everything.   Indeed,  in  his  seminal  1980  non-fiction  book/essay  In  Favour  of  Normalcy,  which  was  a  bestseller  in  Israel  but  largely  ignored  elsewhere,  Yehoshua  made  plain  his  utter  negation  of  the  Jewish  Diaspora.  Describing  Jewish  life  outside  Israel  as  “neurotic”  by  its  very  nature,  Yehoshua  stated,  in  no  uncertain  terms,  “the  most  astonishing  and  amazing  thing  is  that  the  terrible  Holocaust,  that  had  its  roots  in  the  existence  of  the  Diaspora,  did  not  destroy  the  Diaspora  virus  among  the  people”.   Only  in  Israel,  he  insists,  can  one  be  absolutely  Jewish.  Jewish  life  abroad,  by  its  very  definition,  suffers  from  a  split  personality,  existing  as  it  does  con  currently  in  both  the  Jewish  and  non-Jewish  world.   A  hundred  years  ago,  or  even  50,  Yehoshua’s  message  would  have  been  wildly  applauded  at  any  Zionist  conference.  Indeed,  it  reflects  the  thinking  of  many  Zionist  leaders  to  this  very  day.  Nonetheless,  in  the  58  years  of  Israel’s  existence,  a  new  status  quo  has  developed  between  Israel  and  the  Diaspora,  not  least  of  which  because  Israel  was  in  need  of  financial  support  and  depend  ent,  to  a  large  degree,  on  the  political  clout  of  American  Jewry.   ■HP-  HE  numbers,  at  least,  are  on  Yehoshua’s  side.  The  only  place  in  the  world   that  the  Jewish  population  is  growing  -  outside  of  Germany,  which  is  ■  replenishing  its  stock  of  Jews  from  countries  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  -  is  in  Israel.  In  the  Diaspora,  Jewish  population  is  in  decline,  and  even  Aus  tralia,  as  reported  in  the  AJN  this  week,  is  feeing  long-term  danger.  In  Israel,  no  doubt,  die  possibilities  of  assimilation  are  very  narrow.   At  the  same  time,  Yehoshua  is  a  fifth-generation  sabra  whose  only  mean  ingful  time  abroad  was  spent  in  Paris,  not  a  particularly  user-friendly  city  for  Jews.  Yehoshua  thus  has  no  first-hand  knowledge  of  the  fullness  of  Jewish  life  that  can  exist  in  a  community  such  as  Australia’s,  which  lives  among  a  toler  ant,  even  welcoming,  Christian  majority.  And  Yehoshua’s  self-confessed  estrangement  from  the  Jewish  religion  denies  him  any  appreciation  of  the  beauty  and  wholeness  of  a  healthy  and  vibrant  Jewish  community,  such  as  Australia’s,  and  of  the  potential  “totality”  of  a  Jewish  life  that  centres  around  family,  synagogue,  school,  community  centre,  organisation  and,  above  all,   love  of  Israel.   Yehoshua,  who  regards  Judaism  as  a  nationality  more  than  a  religion,  must  also  confront  the  sad  fact  that  while  traditional  Jewish  life  in  the  Diaspora  is  thriving,  it  is  denigrated  by  many  Israelis,  mainly  because  of  the  ill-conceived  fusion  between  religion  and  politics.  Jewish  ritual  and  tradition,  which  have  maintained  Judaism  through  two  millennia  of  Diaspora  survival,  have  fallen  into  disrepute  among  large  segments  of  the  secular  public.   Yehoshua  should  be  commended  for  whipping  up  such  controversy,  for  he  has  raised  fundamental  issues  relating  to  the  age-old  debates  over  “who  is  a  Jew”  and  “what  is  a  Jew”,  as  well  as  the  worrying  decline  of  Jewish  populations  in  the  Diaspora.   We  submit,  however,  that  he  is  mistaken  in  his  basic  outlook,  for  as  he  himself  acknowledges  in  his  apology,  the  Jewish  people  are  one,  whether  in  Israel  or  abroad.  Unfortunately,  his  words  reflect  the  often  one-sided  nature  of  the  relations  between  Israelis  and  Diaspora  Jews,  with  the  latter  proclaim  ing  their  undying  allegiance  but  the  former,  more  often  than  not,  indifferent  and  even  antagonistic.   Rather  than  promoting  division  and  strife,  the  Jewish  people  should  con  centrate  on  their  own  uniqueness  and  unity  and  promote  the  synergy  of  their  two  parts,  so  that  their  sum  is  even  greater  than  their  formidable  but  some  times  separate  selves.

"  The  sacrifices  of  staying  Jewish   TORAH  TOPIC   RABBI  ELISHA  GREENBAUM   בא   THERE  is  an  old  myth  about  an   impoverished  Jew  from  the   shtetl  who  visited  the  rabbi  to  complain  about  his  desperate   circumstances.   It  seems  that  he  had  a  house  full  of  kids,  a  nagging  mother-in-law  and  not  enough  food  to  satisfy  them  all.   The  story  goes  that  the  rabbi  advised  him  to  bring  his  farmyard  ani  mals  into  the  house  for  a  while.  When  he  complained  that  it  didn’t  help,  he  was  told  to  bring  in  even  more  ani  mals.  The  idea  was  that  when  he  finally  received  permission  to  eject  them,  he  would  appreciate  the  space  and  quiet   I  never  understood  the  legend.  How  was  the  pauper  helped  by  the  advice?  He  had  learnt  that  it  could  always  get  worse.  So  what?  Did  this  knowledge  in  any  way  alleviate  the  actual  chronic  overcrowding?   If  you  saw  someone  hitting  his  head  against  the  wall  just  so  he  could  report  how  good  it  feels  to  stop  would   you  conjecture  that  this  was  a  man  following  rabbinical  advice  or  would  you  be  more  likely  to  assume  that  he’d  forgotten  to  take  his  medication?   This  week  we  read  how  Jewish  slaves  were  commanded  to  bring  a  sheep  into  their  hovels,  keep  it  there  for  four  days  and  then  slaughter  it  and  smear  some  blood  on  the  doorpost   This  ability  to  stay  true  to  one's  convictions,   rejecting  the  slings  and  arrows  of  trendy  tyranny,  is  an  ability  we  inherited  from  our  forebears.   Now  I  never  grew  up  with  livestock  around  the  house,  but  my  understand  ing  about  animals  is  that  they  make  less-than-perfect  house  guests.  Even  if  God  had  wanted  the  Jews  to  prepare  a  sacrifice  for  him,  surely  he  didn’t  need  to  afflict  them  four  days  in  advance.   Obviously  the  justification  for  their  indoor  animal  husbandry  was  more  than  just  helping  the  Jews  appreciate  their  blessings.   Like  much  of  Judaism,  this  was  an  exercise  in  conspicuousness.  We  brought  sheep  into  our  homes  specif  ically  so  that  our  non-Jewish  neigh   bours  should  witness  and  wonder.   The  Egyptians  used  to  worship  sheep.  To  take  their  “gods”,  the  objects  of  their  veneration  and  protection,  and  publicly  announce  one’s  inten  tion  to  eat  one  of  them  took  a  special  kind  of  conviction  and  courage.   We  are  often  called  on  to  capture  and  slaughter  the  sacred  cows  of  con  temporary  society.  To  live  a  life  of  reli  gion  and  morality;  to  project  faith  in  die  face  of  the  overbearing  popular  culture  demands  strength  of  purpose   and  self-belief.   This  ability  to  stay  true  to  one’s  convictions,  rejecting  the  slings  and  arrows  of  trendy  tyranny,  is  an  ability   we  inherited  from  our  forebears.   Just  as  their  courage  for  God,  exhibited  in  a  foreign  land,  proved  them  worthy  of  redemption,  so  too  will  we  walk  firm  in  our  ways  for  now  and  until  eternity.

"  n  my  first  visit  to  Paris  nearly  10  years  ago,  I  joined  a  guided  tour  of  Notre  Dame  Cathedral.  As  the  guide  went  into  great  detail  on  matters  of  architecture  and  Christian  theology  I  couldn’t  help  noticing  a  dark-eyed  young  man  who   seemed  to  be  taking  an  intense  and  solemn   interest  in  the  lecture.   The  guy  turned  up  again  a  few  days   later  at  another  Paris  church  —  the   breathtaking  Sainte  Chapelle,  a  gothic   masterpiece  with  stained-glass  windows   encircling  most  of  the  upper  floor.  This  time   we  introduced  ourselves  and  headed  off  for  a  coffee.  I  assumed,  for  obvious  reasons,  that  he  had  a  thing  for  Jesus.  But  as  it  turned   out,  my  coffee-cum-dinner  companion,  Joe,  was  a  thoroughly  Jewish  student  from  Ohio,   a  member  of  Hashomer  Hatzair  and  a   veteran  ofMachon.You  can  imagine  how   the  conversation  flowed  after  this  revelation:  we  even  uncovered  some  mutual   acquaintances  in  Australia.   Jews  have  taken  to  globalisation  with  &amp;lt;  j  as  much  gusto  as  we  took  to  revolutions  in  centuries  past.   Who  doesn’t  have  a  travel  story  like  this?  Who  hasn’t  pondered  the  mysterious  bond,  the  curious  intimacy,  between  two  Jews   from  separate  corners  of  the  globe?  Joe  and  I  were  modern,  secular  and  worldly,  yet  here  was  something  tribal  at  work.  I  have  a  friend,  a  long-time  traveller,  who  finds   Jewish  companions  every  Rosh  Hashanah,   wherever  in  the  world  he  happens  to  land  —  Croatia,  say,  or  Brazil.   The  writer  John  Le  Carre  captured  this   bond  with  poignancy  in  a  fleeting  line  from  The  Spy  Who  Came  in  From  the  Cold.   Jews  have  taken  to  globalisation  with  enthusiasm  ...  looking  for  love  in  Chicago?  Well,  you  might  find  it,  at  the  click  of  a  mouse,  in  Cape  Town.   Comrade  Fiedler,  a  calculating  Jewish  East  German  intelligence  officer,  presides  over   the  interrogation  of  the  naive  and  doomed  Liz  Gold,  a  Jewish  British  librarian  with  Marxist  sympathies.  Le  Carre  writes  of   Fiedler:  “His  deep  brown  eyes  rested  on  her  a  moment,  and  he  smiled  very  slighdy,  as  if  in  recognition  of  her  race.”  (Incidentally,  I  consider  it  an  outrage  that  Le  Carre,  so   perceptive  of  the  Jewish  condition  and  its  messy  complexities,  has  been  accused  of  antisemitism.)   And  so  it’s  hardly  surprising  that  Jews  have  taken  to  globalisation  with  as  much   gusto  as  we  took  to  revolutions  in  centuries  past  -  the  industrial,  the  Marxist  and  so  on.  Writes  Dutch  historian  Evelien  Gans:  “As   the  people  of  the  Diaspora  with  a  very  specific  history,  are  the  Jews  not  a   manifestation  of  globalisation,  and  have   they  not  been  so  for  longer  than  anyone   can  remember,  well  before  the  term  came  into  use?”   You  only  have  to  look  at  the  extent  of  intercontinental  Jewish  coupling  via  the  internet,  to  see  this  globalism  at  work.   Looking  for  love  in  Chicago?  Well,  you  might  find  it,  at  the  click  of  a  mouse,  in  Cape  Town.   I  remember  a  family  trip  to  the  US  in  which  we  ended  up  sharing  a  taxi  with  a   middle-aged  grandmother  from  California.  After  listening  to  20  minutes  of  free  wheeling  conversation,  the  taxi  driver   remarked  on  how  it  seemed  as  if  we’d  been   friends  for  years.  The  woman  answered  in  her  nasal  drawl:  “Yeah,  well,  we’ve  got  a   common  history  and  a  common  heritage,  you  see.”  From  memory,  we  hadn’t  even  verbalised  our  common  Jewishness;  the   truth  was  so  self-evident  it  didn’t  need  mentioning.   Sadly,  it’s  also  no  surprise  some  elements  of  the  anti-globalisation  movement  indulge  in  antisemitic  themes,  reviving  conspiracy  theories  that  have  their  origins  in  The  Protocols  of  the  Elders  of  Zion.  The  all  powerful  Jew  advancing  a  sinister   transnational  agenda  is  a  decidedly   fashionable  subject  these  days,  with  even   respectable  institutions  willing  to  give  this  toxic  complaint  a  hearing.   Of  course,  there  are  instances  when  Jews  fail  to  find  common  language  with  one   another  but  merge  miraculously  with  the  most  unlikely  people.  Israeli  tourists,   especially  when  they  descend  on  certain  places  en  masse,  tend  to  be  aloof  and   abrasive  toward  their  fellow  Jews  from  the  Diaspora  —  or  anyone  else  for  that  matter.  And  some  American  Jews  are  so  myopic  and  chauvinist  they’re  incapable  of   identifying  with  Jews  from  elsewhere.   By  contrast,  a  young  gypsy  woman  on   the  streets  of  Budapest  once  threw  her  arms  around  me  after  only  a  few  minutes  of   conversation.  All  I  said  was  that  my  parents  were  Jews  who  survived  the  Holocaust  and  later  emigrated.  “Good  on  them,”  she   declared.  It  was  almost  as  if  she’d  sensed  the  heavy  past  that  seemed  to  stalk  me  there.   In  the  same  year  I  met  Joe,  a  year   devoted  to  travel  and  philosophy,  I  struck   up  a  friendship  in  Britain  with  a  kid  in  his.  late  teens  from  the  French  protectorate  of  Martinique  in  the  Caribbean.  He  was   studying  at  an  elite  college  in  Paris.  He   seemed  to  brood  while  all  the  Americans   around  him  drank  beer  and  sang  loudly  and  wore  baseball  caps  back  to  front.  He   confessed  to  feeling  not  quite  French  and  not  quite  comfortable  in  his  homeland  either.  One  night,  as  we  talked  about   fragmented  cultures,  about  colonialism   and  genocide,  he  remarked:  “I  don’t  know  how  you  cope  with  your  history,  I  really   don’t.”   His  was  a  Jewish  soul,  you  could  say.  Sometimes  you  have  to  venture  far  and  wide  to  encounter  one.   Julie  Szego  is  a  journalist  at  the  Age. ",2006-09-22
"  My  long-lost  Jewish  identity   MARK  FRANKLIN   '  BELINDA  Milne  believes  that  she  and  her  mother  are  part  of  an  unbroken  line  of  Jewish  women,  despite  neither  of  them  having  identified  as  Jews  before.   When  Milne  attended  a  Pesach  seder   last  year  in  her  hometown  of  Coffs  Harbour  -  organised  by  Rural  and  Regional  Australia’s  Rabbi  Dov  Oliver  -  she  immedi  ately  felt  at  home.   “I  felt  very  comfortable,  the  people  were  so  nice,  and  all  of  them  had  some  kind  of  unusual  story  to  tell,”  she  told  the  AJN  this   week.   Milne’s  grandmother,  Willamina,  was  bom  in  Poland,  but  migrated  to  France  when  her  parents  were  killed,  apparently  in  a  French  pogrom.   At  the  age  of  eight,  Willamina  was  sent  to  a  family  in  Melbourne,  where  she  lived  until  she  married  William  Marshall.  The  couple  gave  birth  to  Connie,  who  is  now  --aged  92  and  lives  in  Geelong.   As  a  child,  Connie  spent  a  lot  of  time  with  Jewish  friends,  particularly  with  a  girl  named  Emma  Jacobs,  with  whom  she  remained  friendly  into  adulthood.   Connie’s  mother  tried  to  encourage  her  friendship  with  Jewish  people,  but  her  father  did  not  like  her  contact  with  the  Jewish  community.   About  a  year  ago,  Milne  began  to  take  heed  of  signs  that  were  creeping  into  her  life  that  suggested  she  was  Jewish.   She  and  her  mother  began  exploring  their  Jewish  roots  and  they  are  now  con  vinced  that  they  are  part  of  an  unbroken  maternal  Jewish  line.   “I-don’t  feel  as  if  I’ve  ever  fitted  any  where,  but  I  immediately  felt  as  if  I  fit  in  with  the  Jewish  community,”  she  says.   She  is  extremely  thankful  to  Rabbi  Oliver  for  allowing  her  to  participate  in  the  Coffs  Harbour  Pesach  seder.  “When  the  rabbi  was  doing  the  service,  I  felt  trans  ported  away,”  she  reflects.

"  BUILDING  A  SINO-JEWISH  BRIDGE  ---------------------------------------------------  LORIN  BLUMENTHAL   IN  a  ""small""  Eastern  Chinese   province  of  90  million  people,  12  postgraduate  students  at  Shandong  University  are  not  study-  ing  Mandarin.   Instead,  they  are  reading  the  Talmud,  under  the  instruction  of  Australian  professor  Avrum  Ehrlich,  a  former  rabbi  who  was  expelled  from  Moriah  College.   Ehrlich  went  to  China  to  visit  his  brother  almost  two  years  ago.  He  presented  a  paper  at  a  Jewish  stud-  ies  conference  at  Shandong  University  and  accepted  an  offer  to  stay  on.   ""I  want  to  develop  Jewish  Chinese  relations  so  that  we  have  a  forum  for  intellectual  and  cultural  exchange.  China  is  an  emerging  superpower  and  it  is  in  our  interests  to  develop  relations,""  Ehrlich  told  the  AJN  during  a  visit  to  Sydney  last   week.   The  school  of  philosophy  and  social  development  at  Shandong  University  opened  a  centre  for  Jewish  studies  over  10  years  ago,  under  the  leadership  of  Professor  Youde  Fu.  The  centre  held  its  first  summer  school  in  Jewish  studies  in  July  last  year,  in  which  70  students  attended,  from  8am  until  10pm,  studying  Jewish  history,  songs  and  kabbalah.  All  postgraduate  scholars  of  Jewish  studies,  under  Ehrlich's  instruction,  can  read  classical  Hebrew  within  a  month.   ""Even  though  Judaism  is  still  not  officially  recognised  in  China,  Jewish  studies  has  made  its  way   Avrum  Ehrlich  sits  in  a   succah  with  his   students  from  Shandong  University.   into  mainstream  academic  think-  ing,  and  its  horizons  are  burgeon-  ing  in  the  most  unlikely  places,""   Ehrlich  said.   There  are  at  least  10  other  uni-  versities  that  offer  courses  in  Jewish  studies  in  China.  Beijing  University's  school  of  foreign  languages  teach-  es  a  four-year  course  in  modern  Hebrew  and  has  12  students  per  year.  Shanghai  Academy  of  Social  Sciences  has  15  postgraduate  stu-  dents  researching  modern  Jewish  politics,  conflicts  and  thought.  There  are  also  courses  at  the  University  of  Harbin,  where  a  signif-  icant  Jewish  community  used  to  live,  and  Nanjing  University  under  Professor  Xu  Xin,  who  translated   the  Encyclopaedia  Judaica  into   Chinese.   ""They  feel  they  need  to  embrace  and  understand  Judaism  as  an  underpinning  of  world  civili-  sation.  Their  three  Messiahs  -  Einstein,  Freud  and  Marx  -  are  all  Jewish.  These  are  the  crucial  figures  for  modern  China,""  he  said.   Chinese  interest  in  Judaism  is  not  a  new  concept,  according  to  Ehrlich.  China  was  one  of  the  only  countries  that  opened  its  doors  to  the  Jews  of  Eastern  Europe.  There  are  currently  3000  Jews  in  Shanghai  and  3000  in  Beijing.   Ehrlich  believes  that  China  and  the  Jews,  as  ancient  and  complex  civilisations,  are  far  more  connected   Avium  Ehrlich  with  his  70  summer  school  students,  who  study  Judaism  for  14  hours  each  day  for  two  weeks.   than  people  may  think.  Australia  must  take  responsibility  for  the  Jews  of  China  and  make  a  greater  effort  to  establish  relations,  he  said.   ""Many  people  ask  me  why  I  teach  Jewish  studies  in  China.  I  remind  them  that  in  the  mid-  1800s,  the  rabbis  and  leaders  of  Jewish  communities  in  Eastern   Europe  looked  upon  America  with  contempt,  calling  it  the  treif  medina  [unkosher  land]  and  threatened  excommunication  to  those  who  expressed  a  desire  to  immigrate.  Within  a  century,  it  had  become  one  of  the  few  places  of  refuge  for  Jews,  the  Jewish  people's  closest  ally,  helping  establish  an  independ-  ent  Jewish  State  and  becoming  a  centre  for  Jewish  learning  and  cul-  tural  activity  unparalleled  in  Diaspora  Jewish  history,""  said   Ehrlich.   “China  is  an  emerging  superpower  and  it  is   in  our  interests  to  develop  relations.”   AVRUM  EHRLICH   A  graduate  of  Killara  High  School  in  1986,  Ehrlich  completed  a  bachelor  of  arts  in  Jewish  philoso-  phy  and  political  science  at  Bar-Ilan  University  in  1993  and  received  his  rabbinical  ordination  at  Yeshivat  Tomchei  Temimim  Lubavitch.

"  LEXI  LANDSMAN   AN  evangelist  group  in  north  ern  NSW  that  was  expelled  from  a  Catholic  church  for   espousing  Jewish  conspiracy   theories  has  removed  the  offending  material  from  its   website.   But  the  Apostles  for  Life  website  still  has  links  to  arti  cles  with  anti-Jewish  content,  the  A/N  has  learned.   The  Lismore-based  group  has  removed  the  “Killing  us  left  and  right”  link,  which  claims  that  abortion  is  a  Jew  ish  plot  for  Christian  geno  cide,  following  calls  from  B’nai  B’rith’s  Anti-Defamation  Commission  (ADC)  and  Father  Dennis  Carroll  of  St  Carthage’s  Cathedral.   Newly-elected  ADC  chair  man  Michael  Lipshutz  com  mended  the  Catholic  Church   for  its  response  to  the  evangel   ists’  behaviour.   “It’s  an  excellent  result;  we  were  concerned  that  this   group  is  antisemitic  and  should  not  be  associated  with   the  Catholic  Church,”  Lip  shutz  told  the  AJN.   Father  Carroll  said  he  was   pleased  to  “expose  this  group  of  antisemitic  people  that  were  operating  in  our  parish”.   Apostles  for  Life  is  led  by  locals  Angela  and  Nadir   Martello.   Although  they  have  removed  the  article  on  abor  tion  by  Joanna  Francis,  which  was  first  spotted  by  ADC  member  and  Lismore  resident  Julie  Nathan,  there  is  still  a  link  to  Nadir  Martello’s  personal  website,  Shedding  Light.   In  an  article  called  “Hezbollah:  model  for  manli   ness”,  Francis  writes,  “the  Khazar  Jews  ...  [are]  simply  Jewish  squatters  on  Arab  land.  And  the  Arabs  intend  to  evict  them.  That  is  not  terror.  That  is  justice.  And  that  is  manly.”   Lipshutz  said  that  if  there  is  still  antisemitic  content  on  the   website,  further  action,  possi  bly  even  legal  action,  will  be   taken.   “If  they  want  to  go  and  propagate  this  racist  nonsense,  there  are  consequences  of  that;   the  matter  may  well  not  be  |   over  for  them.  We  will  not  allow  the  racist  rubbish  to  be  propagated  in  Australia.”   Father  Carroll  said:  “My  genuine  position  is  that  inter  faith  relations  are  very  impor   tant  in  Australia  and  we  can’t   have  this  negativity.  The  unity  and  peace  of  our  society  depends  on  it” ",2006-12-08

AIF  is  a  Muslim  advocacy  organisa  tion  established  in  2001.  Each  year  it  honours  a  Jewish,  a  Christian  and  a  Muslim  woman  who  has  worked  towards  building  bridges  between  the  three  religions.   Bom  in  Hungary,  Ban,  who  immi   grated  from  the  United  States  in  1991,  said  she  was  delighted  to  have  been  selected,  although  she  was  surprised  at   the  award.   “I  think  it’s  an  honour  that  I  don’t  deserve  yet,  but  I  hope  I  will.”   Ban  currently  heads  NSTE’s  Mus  lims  Dialogue  Group,  which  last  year  arranged  a  successful  inter-faith  Suc  cot  celebration  that  featured  Indone  sian  Muslim  drummers  and  a  Christian  gospel  group.   She  assumed  leadership  of  the  group  from  NSTE’s  Rabbi  Alison  Conyer,  who  returned  to  the  United   States  last  year.  Ban  has  been  instru  mental  in  linking  Jewish  volunteers  with  young  Muslims  living  in  Fairfield.   “We  are  minorities  in  Australia  and   many  Australians  have  a  perception  that  Jews  and  Muslims  hate  each  other,  so  it’s  therefore  very  good  for  us  to  be  seen  to  be  working  together  because  it  sets  a  great  example,”  she  said.

"  Pro-Jewish  Labor  senator  dies   AW  STAFF   JOHN  Wheeldon,  a  former  Labor  senator  who  campaigned  to  assist  Soviet  Jewry  in  the  1970s,  died  at  his  Sydney  home  last  week,  aged  76.   Isi  Leibler,  a  three-time  former  president  of  the  Executive  Council  of  Australia  Jewry  (ECAJ),  said  Wheeldon  had  been  a  driving  force  in  bringing  world  attention  to  the  plight  of  Soviet  Jewry.   “He  was  one  of  the  great  friends  of  the  Jewish  people  and  especially  of  Soviet  Jews,”  Leibler  told  the  AJN  this  week  by  phone  from  Jerusalem.   “He  was  a  true  intellectual,  a  social  democrat  of  the  old  school  and  reacted  violently  against  any  manifestation  of  racism   and  repression.   ECAJ  president  Grahame  Leonard  paid  tribute  to  Wheeldon’s  role  in  reforming  the  Senate  by  introducing  the  committee  system  as  a  means  of  increasing  transparency.   A  senator  for  16  years,  Wheeldon  began  his  political  career  with  the  WA  Liberal  Party  before  defecting  to  the  ALP  over  then  prime  minister  Robert  Menzies’  Communist  Party  Dissolution  Bill  in  the  1950s.   Wheeldon  was  elected  to  the  Upper  House  in  1965  and  was  appointed  to  cabi  net  when  Gough  Whitlam  became  PM  in  1972.  After  leaving  politics  in  1981,  Wheel  don  worked  as  an  associate  editor  at  the  Australian.  Wheeldon  is  survived  by  his  wife,  Judith,  two  sons  and  a  daughter. ",2006-06-02
"  US  ice  hockey  player  Mathleu  Schneider  In  action  for  the  Detroit  Red  Wings.   Photo:  Detroit  Red  Wings   Games  to  provide   home  for  ‘wandering’  Jewish  hockey  star   CHANANTIGAY   MATHIEU  Schneider’s  father  calls  him  the  “Wandering  Jew”.   And  while,  historically  speaking,  most  Jews  haven’t  done  their  wan  dering  on  ice  skates,  it’s  not  difficult  to  see  how  the  term  applies  to  Schneider.  Over  the  course  of  his  17-year  National  Hockey  League  (NHL)  career,  he’s  played  in  seven  different  cities,  several  of  them  more  than  once.   Currently  a  star  defender  for  the  Detroit  Red  Wings,  he’s  bounced   from  Montreal  to  Toronto  to  Los   Angeles  to  Detroit;  then  back  to  Montreal  and  on  again  to  Long  Island,  Toronto,  Manhattan,  Los  Angeles  and,  once  again,  Detroit.   “I’ve  been  fortunate  throughout  my  career  to  play  in  cities  with  tremendous  Jewish  communities,”  Schneider,  36,  said.  “I  feel  as  though  I’ve  been  a  role  model  in  each  city  that  I’ve  played  in.  There  are  very  few  Jewish  hockey  players,  and  it’s  been  a  nice  role  for  me  and  I’ve  really  enjoyed  it.”   Next  week,  Schneider  will  suit  up  for  another  trip:  this  one  to  Torino  where  the  “Wandering  Jew”  will  strap  on  his  skates  as  a  member  of  the  US  Olympic  hockey  team.  It’s  the  second  time  Schneider  will  be  representing  the  United  States  on  Olympic  ice  -  and  this  time,  Schnei  der  says,  he’s  hoping  to  just  enjoy  the  experience.   “The  first  time  around  there   were  so  many  uncertainties,”  Schneider,  a  native  of  New  York,  said  of  the  1998  games.  “It  was  the  first  time  the  NHL  went  to  the   Olympics.  The  travel  was  really  tough.”   Schneider  has  played  more  than  1000  NHL  games  since  1987.   Along  with  Washington’s  Jeff  Halpem  and  Los  Angeles’  Michael  Cammalleri,  Schneider  is  thought  to  be  one  of  just  three  Jews  in  the  NHL.  He  says  his  religion  hasn’t  been  a  problem  for  him  on  the  ice.   Early  on  in  his  career,  he  recalled,   there  was  an  incident  in  which  an   opposing  player  unleashed  an  eth   nic  slur.   “That  was  the  first  time  I  heard   any  of  that  stuff.  I  made  a  mental  note  that  the  next  time  I  had  a  chance,  I  would  run  the  guy  into  the  sideboards.  And  I  did,”  he  was  quoted  as  saying  on  the  jewish  virtuallibrary.org  website.   ‘There  are  very  few   Jewish  hockey  players,  and  it's  been  a  nice  role  for  me  and  I've  really  enjoyed  it.""   MATHIEU  SCHNEIDER   Ice  hockey  player   Schneider,  who  maintains  a  home  in  California  and  is  a  member  of  the  Jewish  Community  Centre  in  Redondo  Beach,  California,  said  that  over  the  years  he  has  made  an  effort  to  sit  out  on  Yom  Kippur  and  fast.  It’s  generally  not  too  hard,  he  said,  because  the  high  holy  days  tend  to  fall  during  training  camp  and  not  during  regular  season  play.   Schneider’s  mother  converted  to  Judaism  to  marry  his  father.  Today,  he  said,  “she’s  probably  the  most  knowledgeable  of  the  whole  family”  about  Judaism.   Schneider  and  his  wife,  who  has  been  in  the  process  of  converting  for  the  past  couple  of  years,  have  three  children  -  and  one  more  on  the  way.  They  are,  he  said,  being  raised  as   Jews.   “As  you  get  older,  and  especially  when  you  have  a  family,  religion  becomes  more  important,”  he  said.  “I  was  raised  as  a  proud  Jew  and  I  believe  a  lot  of  the  lessons  Judaism  teaches  relate  really  well  to  family.   “In  the  times  we  live  in,  I  think  it’s  very  important  to  give  children  that  sense  of  guidance,”  he  added.   “Tews  have  always  stuck   together.’   JTA ",2006-02-10
"  Jewish  ethicists  support  therapeutic  cloning   PETER  KOHN   AUSTRALIAN  Jewish  ethicists  have  given  their  in-principle  support  for  therapeutic  cloning  after  the  Senate  passed  a  bill  last  week  legalising  stem   cell  research.   However,  the  same  experts  also  cautioned  against  possible  abuses  of  the  practice  that  could  contravene  halacha,  calling  on  the  government  to  implement  tight  regulations.   Monash  University  law  Emeritus  Professor  Louis  Waller,  who  headed  the  pioneering  In-Vitro  Fertilisation  (IVF)  Committee  in  Victoria  in  the  1980s,  said  he  supports  stem-cell  cloning  to  help  patients  with  diseases.   “While  there  is  always  the  danger  of  rogue  behaviour  with  cloning,  a  rigorous  system  of  licensing  and  effective  regulation  is  being  devel  oped,”  he  told  the  AJN.  The  proce  dure  in  which  a  female  egg  is  injected   with  a  DNA  cell  to  create  a  cell-line   compatible  with  the  sufferer  does  not  create  an  embryo,  unlike  the  process  for  IVF,  Professor  Waller  said.   “The  purpose  is  not  to  bring  about  a  human  embryo  but  to  grow  a  cell-line.  If  this  can  be  achieved,  we  will  have  made  an  enormous  advance  in  medicine.”   As  to  embryo  use,  Rabbi  Faitel  Levin,  an  authority  on  bioethics,  said   that  using  embryos  that  would  oth  erwise  be  wasted  is  halachically  per  missible.  But  creating  embryos  for  the  purposes  of  cloning  “would  not  sit  comfortably”  with  halacha,  he   said.   The  bill,  introduced  by  Victorian   Liberal  senator  and  former  health  minister  Kay  Patterson,  passed  with  34  votes  in  favour,  32  against  and  10  abstentions.  It  is  expected  to  go  before  the  House  of  Representatives  before  the  end  of  the  year.   Rabbi  Dovid  Slavin,  a  co-founder  of  the  Gift  of  Life  bone-marrow  unit   at  Wolper  Jewish  Hospital,  said  the  anticipated  green  light  for  stem-cell  development  would  provide  new  hope  for  leukaemia  patients.   Precious  umbilical  cord  blood,  which  has  the  greatest  potential  to  be  matched  to  leukaemia  sufferers,  would  be  more  readily  available  if  cloning  was  introduced.   He  said  the  tiny  number  of  blood  compatible  Jews  -  matches  are  more  likely  within  an  ethnic  group  -  is  a  critical  problem.   “The  Holocaust  happens  over  and  over  again  each  time  a  young  Jewish  person  has  leukaemia  and   there  are  no  donors  available  in  the   family.”   QUTiOGK  18  -  Jews  and  stem  cells ",2006-11-24
"  JEWISH  HEWS   Respect  and  results   THERE  is  little  doubt  that  the  much-coveted  Jewish  school  network   in  Australia,  with  an  attendance  rate  of  about  65  per  cent  of  Jewish  children,  is  an  effective  bulwark  against  the  twin  scourges  of  assimi  lation  and  intermarriage.   There  is  also  little  doubt  that  most  Jewish  schools  excel  in  secular  stud  ies,  and  deliver  HSC  and  VCE  results  year  in,  year  out  that  are  the  envy  of  many  other  public  and  private  schools,  both  here  and  abroad.   Regrettably,  however,  there  appears  also  little  doubt  that  some  of  our  Jewish  schools  have  become  so  focused  on  results  that  they  miss  what  is  arguably  the  most  important  lesson  to  learn  in  life:  menshlichkeit   Like  all  good  Yiddishisms,  it  has  no  direct  translation,  but  all  Jews  under  stand  the  term  “mensh”,  and  all  Jewish  schools  should  aspire  to  produce  not  just  critical  minds,  but  Jewish  souls  imbued  with  menshlichkeit   Indeed,  it  seems  to  us  that  more  of  a  premium  is  placed  on  such  mensh  lichkeit  at  some  Orthodox  and  ultra-Orthodox  schools  in  Australia,  where  values  of  Torah,  both  religious  and  ethical,  often  rank  above  secular  studies.   The  fault  can  easily  be  laid  at  the  doorstep  of  the  principals  and  the  school  boards.  But  many  parents  are  also  to  blame,  by  measuring  a  school’s  success  exclusively  according  to  whether  young  Yosl  is  accepted  into  law  or  medicine  -  and  for  ignoring  wider  aspects  of  educational  values.   This  was  the  point  underscored  last  week  by  Masada  College’s  founding  president,  Dr  Fred  Ehrlich,  and  it  should  not  fall  on  deaf  ears,  especially  since  many  of  our  schools  are  in  the  process  of  appointing  new  principals.   Sydney’s  Moriah  College  and  Melbourne’s  Mount  Scopus  College,  two  of  the  largest  and  most  important  Jewish  schools  in  the  country,  will  begin  new  eras  in  January  under  the  stewardship  of  Orthodox  educators  from   London.   One  is  an  ordained  rabbi  and  an  Oxford  University  graduate;  the  other  has  a  PhD  and  studies  Talmud.  We  assume  both  understand  and  value  the  import  of  menshlichkeit,  and  will  resist  the  temptation  -  and  urging  of  par  ents,  school  boards  and  others  -  to  race  for  results  at  the  cost  of  respect ",2006-09-15
"  Germany  to  slow  Jewish  migration   NEWS  AGENCIES   BERLIN  -  Germany  plans  to  slow  Jewish  Immigration  by  Introducing  a  system  assign  ing  points  to  potential  Jewish'  migrants  who  have  been  flooding  into  the  country  sinqe  1990,  the  German  news  agency  DPA  report  ed  Sunday.   DPA  quoted  the  news  magazine  Der  Spiegel,  reporting  that  the  move  -  which  has   been  agrekl  to  by  German  Jewish  leaders   and  state  officials  -  comes  after  the  coun  try's  Jewish  communities  have  been  over  whelmed  by  the  large  number  of  Jews  coming  from  the  former  Soviet  Union.   Germany’s  Jewish  community  has  grown  to  about  110,000  people,  up  from  30,000  in  1989  before  the  opening  of  the  Berlin   Wall.   Then  chancellor  Helmut  Kohl,  in  the  run  up  to  Germany's  1990  reunification,  opened  the  country  to  all  Jewish  migrants  from  cen   tral  and  Eastern  Europe.The  only  other  group  accorded  such  a  privilege  were  ethnic  Ger  mans  from  the  same  regions.   The  move  -  which  was  not  welcomed  by  Israel  -  was  a  gesture  to  the  then  ageing  German  Jewish  community,  and  was  also  a  tool  of  the  realpoiitik  to  show  the  world  that  Jews  were  willing  to  settle  in  a  reformed  and  reunited  Germany.   But  the  last  years’  growth  appears  to  have  been  too  fast,  and  now  officials  are  determined  to  slam  on  the  brakes.   All  Jews  who  want  to  settle  in  Germany  will  have  to  score  at  least  50  points  out  of  a  possible  105  in  a  ranking  system  to  be  administered  by  a  federal  agency,  said  Der  Spiegel.   The  system  will  be  tested  in  the  coming  year  and  the  results  will  be  evaluated  by  state  officials  and  leaders  of  the  Jewish  community.  YNElTCEWS.GOfi/1 ",2006-07-28

"  AFTER  GRISLY  MURDER  OF  PARIS  JEW   Thousands  march  against  antisemitism   JERUSALEM  POST  STAFF   PARIS  -  Tens  of  thousands  of  demonstrators,  including  ministers  and  politicians  of  all  stripes,  joined  in  a  show  of  force  against   racism  and  anti   semitism  on  Sunday,  marching   through  the  French  capital  after  the  torture  and  killing  of  a  Paris  Jew,  23  year-old  Ilan  Halimi  (pictured).   Some  33,000  people  took  part  in  the  march,  police  said.  Smaller  march  es  took  place  in  other  cities,  including  Lyon  and  Bordeaux,  where  Archbish  op  Jean-Pierre  Ricard,  named  a  cardi  nal  this  week,  took  part.   Police  patrolled  the  crowd  in  Paris,  where  an  array  of  ministers,  including  Interior  Minister  Nicolas  Sarkozy,  joined  the  march.  Opposition  Social  ists,  including  former  prime  minister  Lionel  Jospin,  as  well  as  members  of  other  parties,  were  also  present.  They  made  their  way  from  the  Place  de  la  Republique  to  the  Place  de  la  Nation,  in  eastern  Paris,  in  a  chilling  cold.   French  President  Jacques  Chirac  attended  a  memorial  ceremony  for  llan  Haliml  held  last   week  at  La  Grande  Synagogue  de  la  Victoire  In  Paris.  Photo:  AAP   With  punches  and  boos,  a  crowd  ejected  right-wing  politician  Philippe   de  Villiers  from  the  march.  De  Villiers’  Movement  for  France  blames  immi   gration  for  France’s  social  ills  —  like  the  extreme-right  National  Front  which  was  banned  by  the  organisers  from  the   demonstration.   At  the  end  of  the  demonstration,   hundreds  of  youngsters,  all  masked,  yelled  “Fofana  for  hanging!  Revenge   for  Han!”  Youssouf  Fofana  is  the  lead   suspect  in  the  kidnap-murder  of   Halimi.   The  march  was  called  after  Halimi,  a  23-year-old  mobile  phone  salesman,  was  kidnapped  last  month,  sequestered   and  tortured  for  three  weeks  in  the  southern  Paris  suburb  of  Bagneux.  Allegedly  held  by  a  suburban  gang,  he  was  found  naked,  handcuffed  and  cov  ered  with  bum  marks  on  February  13  near  railroad  tracks  south  of  Paris.

Sarkozy  said  that  Halimi’s  attackers  were  primarily  motivated  by  greed.  “But  they  believed,  and  I  quote,  ‘that  Jews  have  money’,”  he  said.  “That’s   called  antisemitism.”   The  gang,  apparently  operating  for  several  years,  also  tried  to  extort  money  from  several  prominent  fig  ures,  including  a  founder  of  Doctors  Without  Borders,  Rony  Brauman,  who  is  of  Jewish  origin.   “An  investigation  is  under  way,”  said  French  Chief  Rabbi  Joseph  Sitruk  “What  is  certain,  and  important  today,  is  that  a  young  man  was  tortured  for  weeks  in  general  indifference.”   France  has  Europe’s  largest  Jewish  community,  as  well  as  the  largest  Mus  lim  community  in  Western  Europe.   Israeli  Foreign  Minister  Tzipi  Livni  forwarded  her  condolences  to  the  Hal  imi  family.  “We  are  all  pained,  shocked  and  appalled  by  the  gravity  of  the  act,”  she  said.  “Antisemitism  is  not  only  an  issue  of  the  Jewish  people  and  the  State  of  Israel,  but  it  is  a  phenomenon  that  impacts  first  of  all  the  society  in  which  it  appears.”   JERUSALEM  POST ",2006-03-03
"  Illuminating  our  Jewish  flames   TORAH  TOPIC   KAddI  KALKH  UtNtNUI   &gt;(pD  —  DDUH   THIS  is  “Heroes’  Week”  on  the   Jewish  calendar!  On  Shabbat  we  not  only  read  about  one  of  Judaism’s  great  heroes,  Joseph,  but   we  also  celebrate  Chanukah  and  its   fabulous  heroes,  Mattityahu,  Yehuda  HaMaccabee  and  his  “glorious   brothers”.   Why  was  Maccabi  chosen  as  the  name  for  our  international  Jewish  sports  organisation?  The  first  Mac  cabee  family  were  a  brave  and  resilient  group  prepared  to  stand  up  and  fight  for  what  they  believed  in.  Like  their  ancestor,  Joseph,  they  were  able  to  withstand  the  “urge  to  merge”  with  the  majority  culture.   Joseph  was  able  to  resist  the  enor  mous  temptations  that  came  his  way,  be  they  the  sexual  temptation  of  Potiphar’s  wife  or  the  power  tempta  tion  as  viceroy  of  Egypt.  Known  as  “Yosef  HaTzadik”  (Joseph  the  Right  eous),  he  was  a  real  hero.  Not  the  hero  of  classical  myth  who  slays  a  great  monster,  but  one  able  to  control  him  self  and  achieve  true  mastery.  The  poet  Yeats  once  asked,  “Why  do  we  honour  those  who  go  out  onto  the  battlefield,  a  man  needs  as  reckless  a   courage  when  he  enters  into  the  abyss  of  his  own  self”  Joseph  fought  his   own  self  and  won.  That’s  some  hero!   Chanukah  today  is  a  pointed  and  timely  reminder  about  those  almost  unbearable  pressures  to  conform,  not   to  be  different.  The  Siddur  calls  it  the   few  against  the  many,  the  weak  against  the  powerful.  The  pull  to  assimilate,  that  tyranny  of  the  majority  lies  at  the  heart  of  the  Chanukah  story.   IThe  pull  to  assimilate,   |  that  tyranny  of  the   |  majority  lies  at  the  heart  lot  the  Chanukah  story.   At  that  time,  Greece  dominated  the  world  with  its  alluring  culture,  its  exquisite  philosophy  and  poetry.  Infatuated  with  the  Greek  lifestyle  and  values,  many  Jews  rejected  their  Judaism.  Some  even  went  as  far  as  de  circumcising  themselves  and  restor  ing  their  foreskins  (it  helped  you  in  the  Olympics,  which  were  all-nude  revues).  The  Chanukah  saga  is  about  a  “kulturkampf  ”.  Even  though  Christ  mas  is  usually  more  about  kitsch  and  consumerism  than  culture,  underly  ing  this  festive  season  is  a  seductive  siren  call,  a  call  to  throw  off  the  things  that  make  us  different,  to  discard  our  “outdated  and  irrelevant  rituals”,  to  eat  as  everybody  else  eats,  to  marry  as   they  marry.  The  increasing  rate  of  intermarriage  is  a  sure  sign  of  how  many  have  succumbed.   If  the  juxtaposition  of  Christmas   to  Chanukah  is  a  reminder  about  the  urge  to  merge,  it  also  reminds  of  reli  gious  freedom  and  ethnic  sensitivity  in  a  multicultural  society.  Chanukah  is  a  tale  of  a  small  but  resilient  group  of  Maccabees  who  had  the  chutzpah  to  take  on  the  mighty  Syrian  Greeks;  a  tale  about  the  tension  of  sharing  the  general  culture  and  yet  living  a  partic  ularist  lifestyle.  Chanukah,  as  Blu  Greenberg  puts  it,  is  also  about  “how  to  feel  chosen  without  feeling  superi  or  ...  how  to  integrate  positive  mod  em  values  but  not  to  be  swallowed  up  by  them”.  She  adds:  “It  is  not  easy  even  for  an  Orthodox  Jew  who  lives  with  tradition,  day  in  and  day  out,  yet  who   is  often  uncertain  as  to  where  to  draw  the  lines  and  which  lines  to  draw.”   Chanukah  is  about  Jewish  identity  versus  assimilation.  It’s  about  lighting  the  menorah  and  placing  it  in  a  pub  lic  spot,  about  shifting  one’s  Judaism  from  the  periphery  to  the  centre.  It’s  about  actively  lighting  the  candles  -  doing  something  more  about  being  Jewish.  In  a  word,  it’s  about  lighting  a  candle  for  clarity,  a  lamp  for  living,  a   torch  for  Torah.

"  New  Kiwi  Opposition  leader’s  Jewish  roots   GEDAUAH  AFTERMAN   JOHN  Key  (pictured),  the  son  of  an  Austrian  Jewish  immigrant  and  self  made  multimillion  aire,  was  elected  this   week  to  lead  New  Zealand’s  Opposi  tion  National  Party.   Key,  45,  was  voted  in  unopposed  after  former  leader  Don  Brash  resigned  from  the  post  last  Thursday  following  the  publication  of  a  damn  ing  book  about  his  political  career.   Entering  parliament  in  2002  fol  lowing  a  career  in  investment  bank  ing  -  including  several  years  as  the  head  of  global  foreign  exchange  operations  for  Merrill  Lynch  -  Key  is  believed  to  have  a  very  good  chance  of  leading  the  National  Party  to  a   victory  in  the  2008  elections  and  to  succeed  Labour’s  Helen  Clark  as  prime  minister.   Bom  in  poverty  and  raised  by  his  Jewish  immigrant  mother  in  a  Christchurch  state  house,  Key  and  his  sisters  were  not  brought  up  as  Jews.  Later  in  his  life,  however,  Key’s  mother  renewed  her  Jewish  connec  tions  and  eventually  had  a  Jewish  burial  ceremony.   While  Key  himself  is  a  non-prac  tising  Jew,  he  openly  acknowledges  his  Jewish  roots  and  maintains  links  with  the  Jewish  community.  He  has  often  spoken  proudly  of  his  mother  and  of  being  guided  by  her  values.  One  of  Key’s  sisters  is  also  involved  with  the  Jewish  community  in   Christchurch.

"  OBITUARY   Editor,  reporter,  Jew   SEND  OBITUARIES  TO  jrobuck@jewishnews.net.au   SAMUEL  FREEDMAN   AM  Rosenthal  was  the  chief  editor  of  the  New   York  Times  -  arguably  the  world’s  most  prominent  newspaper  -  for  over  17  years.  His  list  of  journalistic  achievements  is  formidable:  publishing  the  Pentagon  Papers  against  the  opposition  of  the  Nixon  Administration;  infusing  vivid,  stylish  writing  into  the  dully  authoritative  pages  of  the  newspaper  known  as  the  Good  Grey  Lady;  rescuing  the  paper  from  financial  peril  through  the  creation  of  new  sections  covering  topics  from  science  to  home  decor,  all  of  them  sources  of  major  advertising  revenue.   At  the  same  time,  however,  by  the  time  he  died  last  week  at  the  age  of  84,  Rosenthal  was  more  than  a  staunch  supporter  of  Israel;  he  had  done  more  than  any  one  individual  to  reconcile  the  Times  to  its  Jewish  identity.  He  made  being  a  Jew  on  the  Times,  or  being  a  Jew  of  the  Times,  unashamedly,  unexceptionally   normal.   As  managing  editor  and  then  executive  editor,  the  posts  he  occupied  from  1969  until  1986,  Rosenthal  undid  one  of  the  Times’  final,  unspoken  limitations  on  Jews.  He  installed  David  Shipler  as  bureau  chief  in  Jerusalem,  assuming,  based  on  the  reporter’s  surname  and  coarse  black  beard,  that  he  was  Jewish.  Learning  only  after  the  appointment  that  Shipler  was  actually  Gentile,  Rosenthal  waited  several  more  years  until  the  correspondent  finished  his  tenure  and  then  awarded  the   AM  ROSENTHAL   1922-2006   Jerusalem  post  to  Thomas  L  Friedman.   Midway  through  his  70s,  Rosenthal  returned  to  Central  Synagogue  to  finally  become  bar  mitzvah.  I  tend  to  think  he  did  so  less  as  evidence  of  a  spiritual  awakening  than  as  confirmation  of  a  soul  that  had  been  Jewish  all  along.  On  Sunday,  May  15,  his  funeral  was   held  there.   JERUSALEM  POST   The  writer  is  a  professor  of  journalism  at   Columbia  University. ",2006-05-26
"  I  I  I  w  I   Ben  Folds  sets  his   Jewish  record  straight   NICOLE  BRESKIN   ESPITE  the  fact  that  Ben  Folds  has   iJewish  family  members,  got  his  break  I—s  as  a  bar  mitzvah  singer  and  named  his  latest  album  after  a  Jewish  guy,  he  swears  he   is  not  Jewish.   “Look,  let  me  get  this  straight,  I  am  not  Jewish,”  the  platinum-selling  musician  said  in  an  interview  with  the  AJN  from  Adelaide,  where  he  spends  part  of  the  year  with  his  Australian  wife,  Frally  Hynes,  who  is  a  pho  tographer,  and  their  two  children.   But  American-born  Folds,  who  will  head  line  a  concert  at  the  Sydney  Opera  House  with  the  Sydney  Symphony  Orchestra  next  week,  understands  why  the  misconception  about  his  religious  background  frequently   occurs.   He  recently  attended  his  nephew’s  bar  mitzvah  (his  brother  married  a  Jewish  girl);  he  has  a  Jewish  aunt  and  cousins;  he  used  to  perform  at  bar  mitzvahs  and  Jewish  wed  dings  before  he  started  making  award-win  ning  records;  and,  most  importantly,  he  knows  all  the  words  to  Hava  Nagillah,  even  though  he  does  not  know  what  they  mean.   “None  of  my  Jewish  friends  know  what  the  words  mean  either,”  he  said,  adding  that  the  lyrics  just  “roll  off  the  tongue”.   Folds  even  performed  a  rendition  of  the  famous  Jewish  song  to  add  a  bit  of  variety  to  a  rock  concert  in  Hamburg.   He  has  also  teamed  up  with  New  York  City  band  Klezmatics,  whose  music  is  grounded  in  Jewish  spiritualism  and  Eastem-European   tradition,  on  Stephen’s  Last  Night  in  Town,  a  song  he  recorded  with  his  former  band,  Ben  Folds  Five.  Before  disbanding  in  2000,  the  group  -  who  were  actually  a  three-piece  ensemble  -  released  popular  hits  including  Brick,  Song  for  the  Dumped  and  Battle  of  Who  Could  Care  Less.   “I  just  love  Klezmer  music.  It’s  soulful  and  the  best  of  so  many  kinds  of  music,”  Folds   said.   Abandoning  his  group  to  pursue  a  solo  career,  Folds  named  his  most  recent  album,  Songs  for  Silverman  (2005),  after  Ben  Goldman,  his  former  A&amp;R  representative  at  Sony  BMG.   “I  was  always  sending  songs  to  him  [Goldman]  for  the  album,  so  I  wanted  to  name  it  after  him.  But  somebody  [from  Sony]  found  out  and  flipped  out,  so  I  changed  it  a  bit  and  turned  it  in.”   The  news  that  Folds  is  not  a  Jew  may  come  as  a  surprise  to  many,  perhaps  even  his  publicist,  who  thinks  he  is.   Deep  down,  with  just  a  touch  of  sarcasm,  Folds  admits:  “I  always  wanted  to  be  Jewish.  All  my  friends  are  Jewish.”   “Maybe  one  day  I’ll  get  my  honourary  Jew  degree,”  he  joked.   Before  Folds  played  with  the  West  Australian  Symphony  Orchestra  last  year,  he  toured  with  Ben  Lee,  an  ARIA^award-winning  Moriah  College  graduate.   For  the  record:  Folds  does  not  practice  any  form  of  organised  religion.   Ben  Folds  will  perform  at  the  Sydney  Opera  House  with  the  Sydney  Symphony  Orchestra  from  September   6-9.  Inquiries:  (02)  9250  7777. ",2006-09-01
"  Israeli  author  sparks  ‘Jewish  identity’  uproar   NATHAN  GUTTMAN   WASHINGTON  -  Celebrated  Israeli  author  A  B  Yehoshua  stirred  contro   versy  at  the  opening  panel  of  the  cen   tennial  celebration  of  the  American  Jewish  Committee  (AJC)  after  saying  that  only  the  State  of  Israel  can  ensure  the  survival  of  the  Jewish  people.   Yehoshua’s  passionate  presenta  tion  took  other  panellists  by  surprise  and  became  the  talk  of  the  annual  Washington  conference.   “For  me,  Avraham  Yehoshua,  there  is  no  alternative  ...  I  cannot  keep  my  identity  outside  Israel.  [Being]  Israeli  is  my  skin,  not  my  jacket.  You  are   changing  jackets  ...  you  are  changing  countries  like  changing  jackets.  I  have  my  skin,  the  territory,”  the  author  told  the  audience,  adding  that  Israeli  Jews  live  a  Jewish  life  in  a  totality  that  American  Jews  do  not  know.   Yehoshua’s  statements  echoed   through  thither  sessions  with  many  participants  expressing  their  dis  agreement  with  the  Israeli  author’s  views.  On  Wednesday,  former  head  of  the  Mossad,  Effaim  Halevy,  also  speaking  to  the  AJC,  distanced  him  self  from  Yehoshua’s  arguments  and  said  that  the  fact  that  Israel  goes  to  great  effort  to  help  Jewish  communi  ties  around  the  world  proves  that   Israel  sees  importance  in  the  Jewish  Diaspora.   Yehoshua  himself  said  he  was  sur   prised  by  the  uproar  over  his  argu   ments.  “It  seems  to  me  obvious  that  our  Jewish  life  in  Israel  is  more  total  than  anywhere  outside  Israel,”  he  said,  adding,  “I  think  this  is  commonsense.  If  they  were  goyim  they  would  under  stand  it  right  away.”   An  activist  in  a  major  Jewish  organisation  who  attended  the  open  ing  panel  said  Yehoshua’s  arguments  “took  us  back  to  the  ’50s  and  ’60s,”  adding  that  “we  are  not  used  to  hear  ing  this  kind  of  approach  any  more”.

"  Speedo-clad  swimmer  stalls  ‘Jewish  baptism’   MARK  FRANKLIN   WHEN  Jonathan  Shteinman  arrived  at  Bronte  Beach  for  his  regular  morning  swim  one  Sunday  last  month,  he  wasn’t  looking  for  a  battle.   But  upon  seeing  30-odd  Jews  for  Jesus  adherents  performing  a  bap  tism  on  a  young  Israeli  traveller,  he  felt  compelled  to  intervene.   “I  felt  instinctively  that  it  was  my  responsibility  to  do  something  to  protect  the  community  and  Jewish  continuity,”  the  43  year  old  said.   Dressed  only  in  his  speedos,  Shteinman  said  he  immediately  approached  the  group  and  began  singing  Am  Yisrael  Chai  and  Shemah  Yisrael,  hoping  to  interrupt  the   ceremony.   The  crowd  watching  the  baptism  was  gathered  around  Bronte  swim  ming  pool.  Two  Jews  for  Jesus  offi  cials  were  in  the  water  with  the  young  Israeli,  aged  in  his  20s.   Shteinman  leapt  into  the  pool,  approached  the  Israeli  and  asked  why  he  was  joining  Jews  for  Jesus.   “He  said  that  as  a  young  person  in  Israel  he  was  going  downhill  spiritu  ally,”  Shteinman  said.  “He  was  trying  to  suggest  that  he  had  made  a  consid   ered  decision.   “There’s  no  doubt  I  found  the  sit   uation  momentarily  bizarre  and   funny,  but  ultimately  it  was  quite  dis  turbing.”   Jews  for  Jesus,  whose  head  office  is  in  Bondi  Junction,  has  caused  con  cern  by  proselytising  to  the  Jewish  community.   Jews  for  Jesus  national  director  Bob  Mendelsohn  said  the  baptism  was  “not  a  conversion  in  the  tradi   tional  sense”  but  rather  the  “final  step  in  a  [Jewish  persons]  public  state  ment  of  faith  as  a  follower  of  Jesus”.   Mendelsohn,  whose  parents  were  Orthodox  Jews,  estimated  that  Jews  for  Jesus  baptises  approximately  20  Jews  per  year.  He  said  he  is  due  to  perform  a  baptism  on  a  Jewish  man   in  Brisbane  this  month.   The  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  has  warned  Jews  to  beware  of  proselytisers.

"  HONOUR  FOR  VETERAN  JEWISH  STUDIES  TEACHER     MARK  FRANKLIN     ALTHOUGH  he  has  taught  several  thousands  of  teenage  boys  their  bar  mitzvah  portions,  Max  Lemberg   insists  that  he  is  not  a  bar  mitzvah  teacher.   “I  am  a  Jewish  studies  teacher,”  the  88-year-old  says  emphatically.  “Teach-  ing  bar  mitzvahs  is  only  on  the  side.”   But  it  is  in  this  role  that  Lemberg  has  become  widely  known  within  Syd-  ney  Jewish  community.  For  more  than  50  years  he  has  helped  Jewish  boys  become  Jewish  men,  teaching  fathers  and  then  their  sons,  a  genera-  tion  later,  to  read  from  the  Torah.   It  is  for  his  services  to  the  Jewish  community,  particularly  as  a  teacher  of  religious  practices  and  tradition   that  he  has  been  awarded  an  Order  of  Australia  (OAM),  an  honour  Lem-  berg  views  with  genuine  modesty.   “I  don’t  know  why  I'm  getting  it,”  he  says.  “I  really  don’t.  Others  have   achieved  more  than  me.”   But  with  his  wife  Hannah  in  hos-   pital,  Lemberg  says  her  absence  has  “taken  away  the  joy  of  getting  the   award”.   Born  in  England,  the  couple  migrated  to  Sydney  with  their  two  daughters,  Vivienne  and  Jeanette,  in  1963  and  Lemberg  took  up  the  post  of   headmaster  at  Hillel  Talmud  Torah.

I  find  it  a  challenge  and  it  keeps  me  active,  which  is  most  important.  I  don’t  accept  that  I’m  at  this  age  where  I  have  to  give  up,”  Lemberg  says  with   characteristic  fire.   He’s  a  no-nonsense  teacher  who   sets  high  standards  for  his  students.   “What  would  you  do  if  you  were  a   maths  teacher  and  a  student  said  two   plus  two  made  five?  Would  you  accept  it?  No.   “The  Torah  is  supposed  to  be  read  in  a  particular  way  and  its  musical  notes  are  supposed  to  be  sung  in  a  particular  way,  and  that’s  how  it   should  be  done.”   As  for  the  importance  of  teaching  young  Jews  about  their  religion,  Lem-  berg  says:  “I  teach  the  subject  in  the  hope  that  it  reaches  some  status  in   their  own  minds.” ",2006-01-27
"  German-Jewish  leader  Paul  Spiegel  dies   ID  BY  AXELROD   BERLIN  -  The  head  of  Germany’s  Jewish  community,  Paul  Spiegel  (pictured),  died  this  week  of  complications  from   cancer.  He  was  68.   The  news  drew  immediate  condo  lences  from  across  the  political  and  religious  spectrum.  German  Chancel  lor  Angela  Merkel  mourned  Spiegel  as   “a  very  impressive  personality”,  who  “dedicated  himself  passionately  to  building  a  good  future  for  the  Jewish  community  in  Germany”.   Spiegel,  who  headed  the  Central  Council  of  Jews  in  Germany,  survived  the  Holocaust  along  with  mother  by  hiding  in  Belgium;  his  father  and  sister  were  murdered  by  the  Nazis.  Elected  president  of  the  council  in  January  2000,  he  represented  a  bridge  between  the  generation  of  concentration  camp   survivors  like  his  predecessor,  Ignatz  Bubis,  and  the  postwar  generations  of   German  Jews.   As  council  head,  he  presided  over  several  major  developments  in  the  postwar  Jewish  community,  including  a  reparations  agreement  for  surviving  Nazi-era  slave  labourers.  Germany’s  Jewish  community  has  grown  fourfold  in  the  last  15  years,  thanks  largely  to  the  influx  of  Jews  from  the  former   Soviet  Union.   JTA ",2006-05-05
"  UNSW  appoints  first  Jewish  studies  chair   MARK  FRAN  KUIV   MORE  Jewish  students  attend  the  University  of  NSW  (UNSW)  than  any  other  tertiary  institute  in  Australia,  but  it  has  never  had  an  ongoing  lecture  ship  in  Jewish  studies  -  until  now.   After  a  painstaking  search  that  took  several  years,  Dr  Julie  Kalman,  origi  nally  of  Melbourne,  has  been  handed  the  university's  first  lectureship  in  modem  Jewish  history.   “The  story  I’m  hoping  to  really  impart  to  students  is  the  story  of  modernity,  of  how  Jews  participated  in  it  and  the  challenges  they  faced,  chal  lenges  that  were  generated  by  western  civilisation,”  she  says.   A  specialist  in  French  antisemitism  who  earned  her  doctorate  at  Mel  bourne  University,  where  she  has  also  taught,  Dr  Kalman  is  aiming  to  devel  op  a  full  program  in  Jewish  history  at  all  three  undergraduate  levels,  which  will  enable  students  to  major  in  Jewish   studies.   Dr  Julie  Kalman,  UNSWTs  first  chair  of   Jewish  studies.   There  are  60  students  enrolled  in  her  first  semester  course,  titled  “Jews  and  modernity”,  which  began  four  weeks  ago  and  tracks  the  Jewish  expe  rience  from  the  enlightenment  and  Jewish  emancipation  to  the  eve  of  the   Holocaust   “This  is  one  of  the   fundamental  courses  to  be  taught  in  any   university  because  from  it  springs  many  of  the   issues  that  Jews  face  in  the  world  today”   DR  JULIE  KALMAN  Jewish  studies  chair,  UNSW   “This  is  one  of  the  fundamental  courses  to  be  taught  in  any  university  because  from  it  springs  many  of  the  issues  that  Jews  face  in  the  world  today  and  many  of  the  ways  that  Jews  live  out  their  Judaism.   “It  gives  you  so  much  insight  into   western  civilisation  and  from  that   point  of  view  it’s  a  really  important  story  for  non-Jews  as  well,”  Dr  Kalman   said.   Next  semester,  she  will  teach  “Nationalism  and  statehood”,  which  tracks  the  history  of  Zionism,  and  “Holocaust  and  genocide  in  historical  context”,  which  deals  specifically  with   the  Holocaust   Previously,  lecturers  including  Dr  Sharon  Kangisser-Cohen  and  Dr  Geoffrey  Brahm  Levey  taught  Jewish  studies  at  UNSW  under  the  auspices  of  the  history  department   Jewish  studies  are  already  taught  at  the  University  of  Melbourne,  the  Uni  versity  of  Sydney  and  at  Monash  Uni  versity,  whose  Centre  for  the  Study  of  Jewish  Civilisation  has  a  privately  funded  chair,  currently  held  by  Profes  sor  Andrew  Markus.  The  university  also  boasts  the  Leon  Liberman  Research  Chair  in  Modem  Israel  Stud  ies,  which  is  funded  in  perpetuity  by  Lee  Liberman  in  memory  of  her  late   husband.   UNSW  emeritus  Professor  Clive  Kessler,  who  was  instrumental  in  organising  Dr  Kalman’s  appointment,  says  the  new  UNSW  position  will  enable  the  teaching  of  Jewish  history  “in  a  form  that  meshes  with  the  teach   ing  of  the  overall  history  of  the  mod   em  world”.   While  the  position  is  currently  only  funded  for  five  years,  Professor  Kessler  has  called  on  Sydney’s  Jewish  Com  munity  to  support  the  Fund  for  Jewish  Higher  Education  to  ensure  its  contin  uation  beyond  2010,  which  he  said  will   cost  in  the  order  of  $2  million.   Among  the  benefits,  he  says,  would  be  the  graduation  of  well-qualified  Jewish  studies  schoolteachers  who  have  a  “scholarly  university-type  grounding  in  Jewish  studies”.   Professor  Kessler  added  that  schol   arly  study  of  Jewish  history  also  helps  shape  Jewish  students’  own  identity.   “Jewish  culture  is  a  key  part  of  modem  world  civilisation.  They  may  seem  in  conflict,  but  in  modernity  the  two  go  together.  Being  Jewish  is  as  good  a  way  as  any  other  of  being  mod  em.  You  don’t  have  to  deny  your  iden  tity  to  be  part  of  the  wider  world.” ",2006-03-24
"  ASTROLOGY  -  THE  JEWISH  WAY     LORIN  BLUMENTHAL   ARIES   JEWISH  Arians  are  quite  uncommon  (you  can  count  the  number  of  real  blondes  at  Jewish   functions  on  one  hand).  Aries,  whose   symbol  is  the  ram,  make  most  public  appearances  during  Rosh  Hashanah.   TAURUS   TAUREANS  are  known  to  be  headstrong,  yet  they  must  be  weary  that   their  lovers  do  not   intend  to  tear  their  hair  out  as  hap-  pened  to  Samson,  supposedly  a  Taurean.  Billy  Ray  Cyrus  was  also  Taurean  -  however  it  is  unclear  how  he  lost  his  locks.   GEMINI   THIS  sign  is  torn  between  the  secular  and  Jewish  worlds.  Spinosa  of  Spain  was   thought  to  be  a  Gemini  and  changed  beliefs  like  underwear.  He  eventually  became  a  beggar.  One  Saturday  he  was  handed  coins  but  refused  them,  as  he  ""didn't  work  on  the  Sabbath"".   CANCER   SOME  would  argue  that  all  Jews  should  fall  under  this  sign  as  Cancerians  are  known   to  be  somewhat  frugal.  Cancerians,   symbolised  by  the  crab,  have  been  ostracised  by  many  Jews  who  will  only  associate  with  them  on  holiday  or  in  remote  locations.   LEO   LEOS  are  known  to  be  generous.  It  is  thought  that  all  chicken  soup   kitchens  were  started  by  Leos.  Like  their  symbol,  the  lion,  nothing  comes  before  their  pride,  and  they  insist  upon  featuring  first  on  JCA  donor  lists.   VIRGO   ALL  strong  leaders  with  speech  impediments  in  Jewish  history  have  been  Virgos.  Shabbatai  Zvi,  a   Virgo,  uttered  his  instructions,  along  with  expletives,  in  monotone  to  the  sound  of  a  drum.  Some  have  argued  that  he  was  the  first  gangster  rapper.   LIBRA   ALTHOUGH  Jewish  Librans  are  known  to  be  flamboyant,  this  star  sign  is  perceived  as  being  flat   and  two-dimensional  (South  Parks'  characters  are  all  Librans).  Libra  has  roots  in  the  French  ""libre"",  meaning  ""free"".  Mordechai  Vanunu  does  not  fall  under  this  sign.   SCORPIO   ALL  the  great  ice  queens  and  villains  of  Jewish  his-  tory  have  fallen  under  this  sign  -  Cain,  Lqvan,   and  Shylock  were  probably  Scorpios.  Despite  an  evil  exterior,  Scorpios  are  introverts  who  love  nothing  more  than  to  curl  up  with  the  Gemmorah  or  a  Myrna  Rosen  cookery  book.   SAGITTARIUS   SAGITTARIANS  are   prone  to  exaggeration  and  narcissism.  Scholars  have  questioned   whether  Moses,  said  to  be  a  Sagittarius,  actually  saw  the  burning  bush  and  not  just  smoke  and  mirrors.   CAPRICORN   CAPRICORNS  are  so  obsessed  with  status  that  they  bring  a  laptop   to  bar  mitzvahs  in  case   they  do  not  like  the  seating  arrange-  ments.  Capricorns  are  experts  at  whip-  ping  up  new  seating  using  Excel  spreadsheets,  placing  themselves  alongside  the  A-listers.   AQUARIUS   THIS  sign  has  a  reputa-  tion  for  being  arrogant.  Mordechai  was  suppos-  edly  Judaism's  first   Aquarian.  He  made  his  niece  negotiate  with  a  dictator,  claiming  it  was  women's  work.  Statistically,  they  cheat  more  than  other  signs  when  looking   for  the  afikoman.   PISCES   THE  fish  easily  loose  grip  on  reality  and  this  is  the  reason  many  become  gefilte.  Pisceans  have   fantastic  senses  of  humour  and  never  tell  jokes  like:  God  said  to  Moses  come  forth,  but  he  slipped  and  came  fifth. ",2006-01-13
"  JEWISH  AGENCY  LAUNCHES  'GLOBAL  CENTRE'  PROGRAM       JONATHAN  SCHNEIDER   JERUSALEM  -  The  Jewish  Agency  has  launched  a  new  “Global  Centre  for  Israel”  project  with  the  aim  of  provid-  ing  a  more  accessible  and  convenient  way  for  Jews  abroad  to  find  informa-  tion  about  developments  and  pro-  grams  happening  in  Israel.  Up-to-date  advice  on  issues  ranging  from  employ-  ment  possibilities  to  buying  an  apart-  ment  will  all  come  under  the  purview   of  the  centre.   Agency  director-general  Moshe  Vigdor  told  the  Jerusalem  Post  that  the  new  initiative,  which  incorporates  an  around-the-clock  call  centre  manned   by  specially-trained  bilingual  profes-  sionals,  will  also  act  as  a  starting  point  for  a  potential  immigrant’s  aliyah  process.  “Instead  of  people  having  to  come  and  visit  us  in  our  offices  world-  wide,  they  can  simply  call  up  our  base   in  Israel  and  we  will  send  emissaries  to  them,”  he  said.   When  asked  what  kind  of  impact  he  hoped  the  new  program  would  have,  he  noted  that  last  year  Israel  absorbed  more  than  24,000  new   immigrants,  and  predicted  “that  this  new  strategy  of  ours  will  help  increase  that  number  to  30,000”.   The  official  open-  ing,  held  at  the  Jewish  Agency  headquarters  in  Jerusalem,  was  hosted  by  Jewish  Agency  chairman  Ze’ev  Bielski  (pic-   tured),  who  declared  his  “excitement  about  the  possibilities  of  the  Global  Centre”  and  hoped  that  in  due  course  the  expected  high  demand  would  lead  to  an  expansion  of  the  current  task   force  and  facilities.

"  Poverty  forum  moots  Jewish  Smith  Family   MARK  FRANKLIN   THE  formation  of  a  Jewish  Smith  Family-style  organisation  is  one  of  four  initiatives  being  considered  after  a  forum  last  week  on  poverty  in  the  Jewish  community.   The  initiative  could  see  the  estab   lishment  of  a  collection,  storage  and  distribution  system  for  unwanted  clothing  and  household  goods.   The  forum,  organised  by  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies’  Social  Jus  tice  Committee,  also  flagged  the  pos  sibility  of  establishing  a  database  of   Jewish  medical  professionals,  accountants  and  lawyers  who  would  be  willing  to  offer  pro  bono  services.   Jewish  demographer  Dr  Gary  Eck   stein  estimates  at  least  4000  -  or  10   per  cent  -  of  Jews  in  Sydney  are  living  below  the  poverty  line.   He  said  they  generally  live  in  rent  ed  accommodation  and  have  a  week  ly  income  of  less  than  $400  -  just  enough  to  pay  rent,  bills  and  buy   basic  food.   Other  ideas  raised  at  the  forum,  which  was  attended  by  around  30   people,  included  the  establishment  of  an  inner-city  community  centre  to  assist  Jews  living  in  government  hous  ing,  and  a  program  to  teach  young  Jews  about  the  community’s  pockets  of  disadvantage.   One  of  the  forum’s  organisers,  Agnes  Seemann,  said:  “We  have  got  to  be  aware  that  our  community  includes  lots  of  disadvantaged  people  who  might  feel  that  they  don’t  have  access  to  communal  life.  It’s  really  important  that  we  take  responsibility   for  that.”   There  is  currently  one  second  hand  clothing  scheme  operating  within  the  community,  which  is  run  by  Devorah  Markovitch  from  her   home  in  Bondi.   Other  speakers  at  the  forum   included  Red  Cross  national  media  adviser  Vivian  Schenker,  Great  Syna  gogue  Rabbi  Jeremy  Lawrence,  Jew  ishCare  CEO  Mark  Schlosser,  University  of  NSW  Professor  Bettina  Cass  and  the  Salvation  Army’s  Cap  tain  Paul  Moulds.

"  Israeli,  Jewish  flavour  at  writers’  festival   MARK  FRANKLIN   A  FORMER  writer  for  Hustler  maga  zine,  a  leading  British  feminist  and  an  American  TV  star  will  be  among  the  overseas  Jewish  guests  at  this  year’s  Sydney  Writers’  Festival.   Close  to  20  Jews  are  due  to  speak  at  the  festival,  which  runs  from  May  22  28,  including  one  of  this  year’s  biggest  names,  Naomi  Wolf,  a  leading  feminist   and  a  columnist  for  the  Guardian  newspaper.   Four  Jewish  American  writers  are  also  likely  to  pull  big  crowds.  They  include  TV  star  Andy  Borowitz  -  an  actor,  satirist  and  screenwriter  who  has  also  produced  leading  Hollywood  films  and  writes  a  popular  internet   column.   Also  from  the  US  is  former  Hustler  writer  Paul  Krassner,  a  prominent  anti-Vietnam  War  activist  who  later  documented  America’s  psychedelic  revolution  and  claims  to  have  accom   panied  Groucho  Marx  on  his  first  “acid  trip”.   The  other  American  nationals   speaking  will  be  South  African-born  academic  Lynn  Freed  and  Dutch-bom  novelist  Amon  Grunberg.   Among  the  three  Israelis  scheduled  to  speak  at  the  festival  is  Nevo  Eshkol,  the  grandson  of  former  Israeli  prime   Guardian  columnist   Naomi  Wolf...  headlining  this  year’s  Sydney  Writers’  Festival.   minister  Levi  Eshkol,  whose  2005  novel  Homesick  has  become  a  bestseller.   Also  from  Israel  are  publishers  Ziv  Lewis  and  Shimon  Adaf.  Last  year  no  Israelis  spoke  at  the  festival  and  a  Palestinian  writer  sparked  controversy  when  she  claimed  the  failure  of  the   Middle  East  peace  process  was  entirely   Israel’s  fault.   Local  Jews  speaking  at  this  year’s   festival  will  include  veteran  ABC  broadcaster  Ramona  Koval,  whose  books  include  the  novel  Samovar  and  Jewish  Cooking,  Jewish  Cooks.   Another  ABC  broadcaster,  Rachael   Kohn  -  the  host  of  two  radio  shows  on   religion,  who  recently  authored  a  book  on  spirituality  in  the  modem  world,  The  New  Believers  -  will  also  speak   Other  Australian  Jews  talking  at  the  festival  include  philosopher  Peter  Singer,  historian  Konrad  Kweit,  Anna  Friedberg,  Marcelle  Freiman,  Jacob  Rosenberg,  Henry  Rosenbloom,  AJN  columnist  Dr  Ruth  Wajnryb  and  AJN  national  editor  Dan  Goldberg.

To  be  held  primarily  at  Shalom  College  at  the  University  of  NSW,  committee  member  Peta  Jones  Pellach  said  the  main  objective  of  the  festival  is  “to  showcase  writers  who  embrace  their  Jewish  identity  and  who  write  on  Jewish  themes”.   “We  aim  to  promote  the  talents  and  ideas  of  writers  by  introducing  them  to  audiences  that  have  not  yet  read  their  writing  and,  concurrently,  we  want  to   offer  the  opportunity  to  those  who  have  read  their  work  to  meet  the  authors  behind  the  stories,  ideas  or  research,”  she  said.   Writers  already  booked  to  appear  at  the  May  festival  include  Morris  Gleitz  man,  Mark  Baker,  Arnold  Zable,  Diane  Armstrong,  Ron  Elisha,  Jackie  French,  Rachael  Kohn,  Ursula  Dubosarsky  and  Rose  Zwi.  It  is  hoped  a  number  of  international  authors  will  also  agree  to  attend,  added  Jones  Pellach.   Former  premier  Bob  Carr  will  be  patron  of  the  event,  which  will  be  managed  by  former  Belvoir  Street  Theatre  marketing  coordinator  Tanya   Cawthome.  Other  committee  mem   bers  indude  Dr  Vera  Ranki,  Sharon  Shapiro  and  author  Alan  Gold.   The  festival  will  also  hold  writing  sessions  for  children  and  young  adults,  featuring  children’s  authors  Jackie  French  and  Suzanne  Gervay.   Organisers  are  expecting  more  than  1000  people  to  attend  the  event,  which  will  run  biennially  when  adult  educa  tion  festival  Limmud  Oz  is  being  staged  in  Melbourne.  Partidpants  can  either  purchase  festival  passes,  or  attend  on  a  session-by-session  basis.   Session  topics  will  indude  Jews  in  the  media,  poetry  and  biographies.

"  Pens  ready  for  Jewish  writers’  festival   DEBORAH  STONE   FORMER  NSW  premier  Bob  Can  will  open  the  Sydney  Jewish  Writers’  Festival  next  week,  launching  five  days  of  literary  readings,  panel  discus  sions  and  performances.   The  festival  will  showcase  Aus  tralian  Jewish  writers,  as  well  as  some  non-Jewish  writers  whose  work  is  of  particular  interest  to  the  community.   Big  names  include  Arnold  Zable,  Marcus  Zusak,  Alan  Gold,  Morris  Gleitzman,  Ron  Elisha,  Diane  Arm   strong,  Ursula  Dubosarsky,  Rachael  Kohn,  Rose  Zwi  and  Mark  Baker.   The  star  overseas  guest  is  Shalom  Institute  scholar-in-residence  Yael  Unterman,  who  will  perform  her  one-woman  play,  a  bibliodrama  enti  tled  After  Eden.  She  will  also  host  a  Friday-night  dinner  for  young  adults  entitled  “SRW  (Single  religious  writer)  desperately  seeking  God,  for  meaningful  relationship”.   Other  sessions  will  address  writing  about  Jewish  Australia,  telling  Holo  caust  stories,  and  literary  representa   tions  of  Jews.  There  will  be  several  sessions  aimed  at  writers  who  want  to   get  published  and  exploring  the  pen  to-publication  journey.  Two  sessions  for  children  will  also  be  held  on  the  Sunday.   The  festival,  organised  by  Shalom  College,  is  the  first  of  what  director  Tanya  Cawthome  hopes  will  become  a  biannual  event,  alternating  with  Limmud  Oz  to  provide  both  Syd  neysiders  and  visitors  with  a  yearly  dose  of  in-depth  Jewish  culture.   More  than  50  writers  will  take   part,  most  of  whom  are  Jewish.  A  prominent  exception  is  Zusak,  author  of  the  successful  young-adult  novel  The  Book  Thief,  which  deals  with   Holocaust  themes.   Cawthome  said  the  willingness  of  so  many  high-profile  writers  to  give   their  time  for  the  festival  was  a  testa  ment  to  the  writers’  support  of  the  community.   “It’s  a  celebration  of  Australian  Jewish  writing  and  writers,  and  really  embraces  the  wealth  of  talent  that  is  in  our  community.”   Bob  Carr   Arnold  Zable   Alan  Gold   Morris  Gleltzman   Diane  Armstrong   Rachael  Kohn   Mark  Baker   Sessions  will  be  held  on  Wednes   day,  Thursday  and  Saturday  evenings  and  all  day  Sunday.

"  Jewish  artist  Ariella  Friend  will  exhibit  her  works  at  the  Global  Gallery  In  Paddington  this  week.   Jewish  artists  to   exhibit  at  Paddington   NICOLE  BRESKIN   T”  HEMES  of  displacement  and  dispos   session  are  central  to  Marc  Standing’s  latest  artwork,  which  will  feature  in  New  Breed,  an  exhibition  of  14  young  artists  at  the  Global  Gallery  in  Paddington  which  opens  this  week.   Standing,  30,  who  was  bom  in  Zimbabwe,  left  the  country  along  with  many  other  Jews  because  of  political  unrest  and  violence.   His  artwork  reflects  his  conflicting  views  of  the  country  he  still  calls  “home”.   “I  question  and  play  with  [homeland  and]  identity  in  my  work.  I  lost  my  home  and  my  identity  and  had  to  start  all  over  again,”  he   says.   Standing,  who  immigrated  to  Australia  just  over  a  year  ago,  draws  inspiration  from  past  experience,  but  also  on  his  impressions  of  his  new  country.   Interestingly,  he  chooses  to  paint  the  Outback  rather  than  the  coastal  town  of  Noosa,  where  he  resides.   “I  want  to  paint  the  Australian  landscape,  but  beyond  the  stereotype  of  the  blue  sky  and  the  red  earth,”  he  explains.   “I  want  to  paint  it  as  beautiful,  but  cruel  too  in  its  vastness  and  emptiness.”   Standing  has  already  exhibited  in  Queensland  and  Victoria,  including  a  solo  exhibition  at  the  Noosa  Regional  Gallery  and  the  Linden  St  Kilda  Centre  for   Contemporary  Art,  but  this  is  his  first  exhi  bition  in  Sydney.   After  living  in  Zimbabwe  for  21  years,  Standing  moved  to  South  Africa  and  studied  at  the  University  of  Cape  Town.   He  later  moved  to  France,  exhibiting  in  London  and  Holland  since  2002.  He  moved  to  Australia  after  a  return  to  Zimbabwe  was  “not  an  option”.   Another  Jewish  artist,  Ariella  Friend,  a  Moriah  College  graduate,  will  also  showcase  her  work  at  the  exhibition.   Friend,  32,  who  is  also  a  graphic  designer,  takes  old  worn-down  objects,  which  others  might  discard  as  rubbish,  and  reinvents  them  on  canvas.   “There’s  so  much  people  are  willing  to  waste;  that  they  just  get  sick  of  and  throw  away.  I  reinvent  the  context  to  make  them  new  again.”   Friend’s  first  object  that  she  “brought  to  life”  was  a  skirt  from  the  Paddington  Markets  which  she  bought  at  age  16.  Nearly  a  decade  later,  she  put  it  on  a  canvas  applying  other  mixed  media  including  oils  and  spray  paint.   Friend,  who  has  a  degree  in  visual  com  munications  from  Sydney’s  University  of  Technology,  has  lived  overseas  for  five  years  and  first  exhibited  in  London  in  2002.  Returning  to  Sydney  over  a  year  ago,  she  exhibited  at  Milkwood  Furniture  in  Bondi  in  2005.   The  New  Breed  exhibition  is  at  the  Global  Gallery,  Paddington,  until  July  30.

"  nomRy.nRya2006  JEWISH  CONTENT   RABBI  David  Hartman  could  be  described  as  a  radical,  firebrand  orator  and  author  or  a  brilliant  Jewish   philosopher.  Either  way,  he’s  compelling.   Rabbi  David  Hartman:  “[ABYfeboshua’s]   understanding  Is  that  to  play  basketball  In  Tel  Aviv  Is  a  Jewish  experience.""   In  the  last  hour,  he  has  slammed  birthright  israel  and  the  March  of  the  Living  as  “quick  fixes”,  blasted  our  reliance  on  the  mentality  of  victim  hood  and  pulverised  the  idea  -  pro  voked  by  comments  made  in  America  last  week  by  AB  Yehoshua  -  that  only  Israel,  as  opposed  to  the  Diaspora,  can  ensure  the  survival  of  the  Jews.   Our  identity  crisis  “is  not  about  Jewish  continuity  but  Jewish  content”,  says  Rabbi  Hartman,  stressing  that  the  People  of  the  Book  must  become  the  people  of  the  books.   According  to  Yehoshua,  however,  Jewish  texts  are  “not  the  most  impor  tant  anchor  of  identity”.  Instead,  he  argues,  our  nationalism  is  what   defines  us.   Whereas  the  identity  of  Jews  in  the  Diaspora  is  “voluntary”,  in  Israel  Jew  ish  identity  is  “binding  and  inescapable”,  says  Yehoshua.   But  Hartman’s  response  is  scathing.  “His  [Yehoshua’s]  under  standing  is  that  to  play  basketball  in  Tel  Aviv  is  a  Jewish  experience.”   The  media  is  abuzz.  Scores  of  com  mentators  pitch  into  the  debate.  I  can  almost  feel  my  brain  bulge  under  the  weight  of  these  philosophical  ques  tions  that  will,  ultimately,  determine   our  future. ",2006-05-19
"  JEWISH  HEIMS   Different  year,  same  fears   5767  has  just  begun  and,  much  like  5766,  Israel  remains  a  nation  in   limbo,  waiting  to  see  which  way  the  wind  is  blowing  -  internally  and  externally.  Internally,  the  Winograd  Commission  of  Inquiry  into  the  war  against  Hezbollah  has  begun  its  mandate  to  assess  the  military  and  political  conduct  of  the  war  in  Lebanon  amid  an  atmosphere  of  Israeli  mud-slinging  that  is  -  depending  on  whether  you  are  an  optimist  or  a  pes  simist  -  either  a  measure  of  the  nation’s  robust  democracy  or  confirmation  of  its  depressed  state  of  affairs.   But  judging  by  the  allegations  against  a  raft  of  politicians  and  officials  from  the  top  down,  it  is  indeed  hard  to  be  optimistic,  not  least  when  the  man  charged  with  running  the  country  is  in  his  post  either  by  default  or  because  he  was  simply  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  time.   Understandably  for  some,  the  last  refuge  left  for  optimists  at  a  time  like  this  is  in  a  rose-tinted  fog  of  delusion,  far  removed  from  the  harsh  light  of  reality.   As  AJN  associate  editor  Chemi  Shalev  noted,  albeit  with  a  dose  of  irony,  in  this  week’s  edition,  “the  past  is  bad,  the  present  is  worse  and  the  future,  in  the  best  of  scenarios,  is  unimaginably  catastrophic”.   It’s  hardly  the  kind  of  scenario  in  which  one  wishes  to  usher  in  a  new  year,  along  with  the  piercing  sound  of  the  shofar  and  the  obligatory  apple  and  honey.  And  that’s  just  the  internal  situation.   On  the  external  front,  while  the  Palestinian  factions  appear  to  be  waging  war  on  each  other,  threatening  to  do  to  themselves  what  they  have  done  to  us,  Israel  has  left  Lebanon  again  -  and  again,  it  seems,  the  case  for  optimism  is,  at  best,  half  empty.   True,  there  are  those,  such  as  former  Mossad  director  Efraim  Halevy  who,  on  the  eve  of  his  visit  to  Australia  this  month,  told  this  newspaper  that  Hezbol  lah  was  “seriously  mauled”  in  the  34-day  war.   “It  lost  many  hundreds  of  its  men,  it  lost  many  of  its  capabilities.  [Sheikh  Hassan]  Nasrallah  said  himself  he  did  not  expect  Israel’s  reaction,”  he  said.   Halevy  maintains  that  “Hezbollah  and  the  Iranians  ultimately  knuckled  under  on  a  long  series  of  issues.  They  did  not  wish  an  international  force  to  be  deployed  in  Lebanon  and  they  had  to  agree  to  it  They  did  not  agree  to  an  arms  embargo  in  Lebanon  and  they  had  to  accept  it.  They  are  very  meticulous  in  preserving  the  cease-fire  on  their  side.”   Indeed,  Israelis  in  the  north  no  longer  live  on  a  diet  of  dread  and  despair,  forced  underground  into  a  dark  tunnel  of  fear.   They  were  able  to  celebrate  Rosh  Hashanah,  to  enjoy  the  age-old  rituals  without  worrying  about  the  sound  of  the  air-raid  siren,  the  clarion  call  of  the  Katyusha.   But  for  every  Efraim  Halevy  there’s  a  Binyamin  Ben-Eliezer,  the  cabinet  minister  who  suggests  that  anyone  who  believes  the  Lebanese  Army  offers  Israel  security  on  its  northern  border  is  “delusional”.   Hezbollah  will  return,  he  warns,  and  most  realists  concur.   Even  IDF  Chief-of-Staff  Lieutenant-General  Dan  Halutz  has  conceded  Israel’s  performance  against  Hezbollah  was  “mediocre”.   Who  won  and  who  lost  may  indeed  be  a  matter  for  historians,  but  in  the  here  and  now  of  Tishrei  5767  it’s  increasingly  hard  to  believe  we’ve  seen  or  heard  the  last  of  Sheikh  Nasrallah  and  his  motley  crew  of  militiamen   And  even  if  Sheikh  Nasrallah’s  defiant  bravado  in  front  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  flag-waving  Hezbollah  supporters  late  last  month  was  an  exer  cise  in  hubris,  Israel’s  attempt  to  disarm  and  defeat  his  terrorists  failed  —  regardless  of  the  spin  by  Halevy  and  others.   AND  then  there’s  Iran,  the  agent  of  terror  lurking  behind  the  rubble  of   south  Lebanon.  Hezbollah  may  be  a  proverbial  thorn  in  Israel’s  side,  but  Iran  threatens  to  strike  a  stake  through  Israel’s  heart.   Halevy,  much  like  Prime  Minister  John  Howard,  simply  refused  to  be  drawn  into  the  vexed  question  of  Iran  -  a  sign  no  doubt  that  politicians  and  experts  are  feeling  uneasy  about  the  volatile  and  unpredictable  nature  of  the  Ahmadinejad  regime  in  Tehran.   And  so  we  enter  the  new  year  with  an  old  fear;  we  awaken  again  to  the  for  midable  and  familiar  dark  clouds  on  the  horizon.  We  are  building  booths  this  week  to  dwell  in  over  Succot,  to  shelter  in  just  like  the  Israelites  did  thousands  of  years  ago.   Then  they  were  taking  refuge  from  mother  nature.  Now,  however,  we’re  seeking  refuge  from  enemies  that  wish  us  wiped  “off  the  face  of  the  earth”.   The  forecast  for  the  future  is  unpredictable.  But  even  the  arch  pessimists  should  know  by  now  that  we  Jews  have  survived  innumerable  dark  pages  of  history  -  and  will  do  so  again. ",2006-10-06
"  Out  and  proud  ...Anthony  Mindel  (left)  and  Simon  Morley  carry  the  Aleph  Melbourne  banner  ahead  of   members  from  Arab  &amp;  Gay  who  marched  with  the  Jewish  contingent.  Photo:  Michael  Barnett   Arabs  join  Jewish   gays  in  Pride  March   MELISSA  SINGER   AMID  the  sea  of  rainbow  coloured  balloons  and  banners   at  Sunday’s  11th  annual  Mel  bourne  gay  and  lesbian  Pride  March,  a  group  of  Jews  and  Arabs  joined  forces  in  a  his   toric  inter-faith  encounter.   Arab  &amp;  Gay,  a  newly  formed  group,  joined  around  six  members  of  Aleph  Mel  bourne  —  a  social  and  support  group  for  Jewish  gay  and   bisexual  men  -  for  the  march  through  the  streets  of  St  Kilda.   Aleph  coordinator  Michael  Barnett  said  the  Arab  &amp;  Gay  members,  who  are  Muslims  and  Christians  of  Egyptian  and  Lebanese  descent,  approached  the  Aleph  contin  gent  on  the  day  about  march  ing  together.   Barnett  said  the  show  of   solidarity  was  evidence  that  Arabs  and  Jews,  regardless  of  their  sexuality,  can  “coexist  happily”.   Barnett,  who  is  also  secre  tary  of  the  Australian  Gay  Multicultural  Council,  said  it  was  probably  harder  for  gay  Arab  men  than  their  Jewish  counterparts  to  gain  accept  ance  in  their  own  community.   “It  might  be  a  lot  harder  for  [gay  Arabs]  to  be  visible  in  their  own  community,”  Bar  nett  told  the  AJN.   In  a  similar  vein  to  the  Torah’s  proscription  against  homosexuality  in  Leviticus  18,  the  Koran  (26:165-66)  refers  to  the  homosexual  actions  of  the  men  of  Sodom  and  Gom  morah  as  a  “transgression”.   This  was  the  ninth  year  Aleph  Melbourne  participated   in  the  march.  Other  ethnic   groups  represented  included  the  Greek,  Italian,  Aboriginal   and  Asian  communities.   Barnett  said  maintaining  a  multicultural  presence  at  the   march  was  “essential”   “We  need  to  show  ...  gay  and  lesbian  people  exist  every  where.  They  don’t  need  to  be  discriminated  against,  they  need  to  be  accepted.”   Established  in  1995,  Aleph  Melbourne  has  more  than  50  members.  In  1999,  a  contro  versial  motion  on  whether  to   allow  Aleph  to  join  the  Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victo  ria  was  rejected.   In  Sydney,  the  first  gay  Jew  ish  float  participated  in  the  Sydney  Gay  &amp;  Lesbian  Mardi  Gras  in  2000,  prompting  wide  spread  controversy.  This  year’s  parade  is  on  Saturday,   March  4. ",2006-02-10
"  JEWISH  NEWS   Between  Arendt  and  Wiesel   IF  there  is  an  individual  alive  today  who  is  the  personification  of  Holocaust   memory,  it  is  surely  Elie  Wiesel.  It  is  therefore  unsurprising  that  the  Nobel  Peace  Prize  laureate  is  being  awarded  an  honorary  knighthood  by  the  British  Government  in  recognition  of  his  contribution  to  Holocaust  edu   cation.   Through  dozens  of  books,  reams  of  newspaper  articles  and  streams  of  speeches,  Wiesel  has  articulated  one  central  message  since  his  first  book,  Night,  was  published  in  1958,  almost  half  a  century  ago:  “Remembering,”  he  said  in  accepting  his  Nobel  Peace  Prize  in  Oslo  in  1986,  “is  a  noble  and  necessary  act  The  call  of  memory,  the  call  to  memory,  reaches  us  from  the  very  dawn  of  his  tory.  No  commandment  figures  so  frequently,  so  insistently,  in  the  Bible.  It  is  incumbent  upon  us  to  remember  the  good  we  have  received,  and  the  evil  we   have  suffered.”   It  is  indeed  quite  incredible  that  a  man  who  has  been  stained  by  the  scar  of  genocide,  who  endured  countless  days  and  nights  clambering  Out  of  the  clutches  of  hell,  managed  (and  still  manages)  to  transcend  hatred  to  convey  hope.   Wiesel’s  world  was,  undoubtedly,  tortured  in  the  crucible  of  the  camps,  leading  him  to  the  belief  that  survivors  have  “no  right  to  deprive  future  gen  erations  of  a  past  that  belongs  to  our  collective  memory.  To  forget  would  be  not  only  dangerous  but  offensive;  to  forget  the  dead  would  be  akin  to  killing   them  a  second  time.”   For  that  alone,  he  merits  high  credit   BUT  Wiesel  deduces  that  it  is  impossible  to  rationalise  terror.  “Terrorism   must  be  outlawed  by  all  civilised  nations  -  not  explained  or  rationalised,  but  fought  and  eradicated,”  he  said  in  his  1986  Nobel  lecture,  no  doubt  echoing  the  sentiments  of  many  in  our  community.   So  it  is  no  wonder  that  he  begs  to  differ  with  the  controversial  thesis  of  philosopher  Hannah  Arendt,  whose  centenary  since  her  birth  is  being  marked   around  the  world  this  weekend.   Arendt’s  theory  of  the  “banality  of  evil”  -  namely  that  Eichmann  was  not  a  megalomaniacal  monster  but  an  ordinary  bureaucrat  -  may  still  be  as  un  palatable  today  as  it  was  when  she  wrote  Eichmann  in  Jerusalem.  A  Report  on  the  Banality  of  Evil  in  1963,  but  it  is  myopic  to  discard  it  in  its  entirety.   While  Arendt’s  theory  has  been  deconstructed  by  many  of  her  peers,  we  cannot  fully  understand  the  roots  of  radical  Islamist  terror  if  we  adopt  George  W  Bush’s  us-versus-them  worldview,  and  simply  label  Iran,  Syria  and  North  Korea  -  especially  after  its  missile  test  this  week  -  as  the  “Axis  of  Evil”.   For  if  we  don’t  attempt  to  understand  what  some  describe  as  this  new.  brand  of  totalitarianism  beyond  glib  phrases,  then  arguably,  we  have  little  hope  of  dismantling  it.   In  short,  Wiesel’s  point  is  that  we  can’t  rationalise  or  explain  megalo  maniacs  such  as  Bashar  Assad,  Mahmoud  Ahmadinejad  and  Kim  Jong-il;  Arendt  suggests  the  opposite.   Arendt’s  theory,  like  that  of  Stanley  Milgram,  the  US  professor  whose  exper  iments  on  obedience  to  authority  shocked  the  West  in  the  1960s,  confronts  us  precisely  because  she  inverts  our  worldview  by  suggesting  that,  in  fact,  “we”  could  become  “them”  and  “they”  are  not  so  vastly  different  from  “us”.   But  if  evil  is  indeed  banal,  as  Arendt  maintained,  then  by  deduction,  it  has  no  special  quality,  which  for  many  of  us  living  in  this  post-9/11  world  is  sim  ply  too  narrow  a  theory  when  posited  against  the  tsunami  of  bigotry  and  hatred  that  breeds  modern-day  terrorism.   Wiesel  has  no  doubt  succeeded  more  than  Arendt  in  transmitting  his  mes  sage  to  a  larger  audience.  He  has  waged  and  still  wages  war  on  “indifference”,  which  he  described  as  “the  epitome  of  evil”.   Arendt,  however,  was  more  controversial,  most  notably  in  her  contention  that  Jews  collaborated  in  their  own  destruction,  whereas  Wiesel  spoke  for  the  martyrs  and  the  survivors,  for  those  whose  voice  was  silenced  and  those  whose   silence  became  their  voice.   And  many  of  his  words,  spoken  20  years  ago  in  Olso,  still  ring  true  to  this  day:  “Mankind  needs  to  remember  more  than  ever.  Mankind  needs  peace  more  than  ever,  for  our  entire  planet,  threatened  by  nuclear  war,  is  in  danger  of  total  destruction.  A  destruction  only  man  can  provoke,  only  man  can  pre  vent  Mankind  must  remember  that  peace  is  not  God’s  gift  to  his  creatures,  it  is  our  gift  to  each  other.”   Both  Arendt  and  Wiesel  are  being  celebrated  this  week  for  different  rea  sons;  both  offer  responses  to  the  atrocities  of  yesterday  -  but  both  have  mes  sages  that  resonate  today.   Both  suggest  contrasting  coordinates  on  our  moral  compasses.  Each  view  leads  to  a  different  path,  and  neither  guarantees  success  against  totalitarian  tyrants  or,  for  that  matter,  banal  bureaucrats.   Faced  with  a  war  against  radical  Islamism  and  rogue  regimes,  it  is  timely  to  consider  the  merits,  and  demerits,  of  both. ",2006-10-13
"  CONCERN  ABOUT   DISGRACED  LOBBYIST'S  JEWISH  CONNECTIONS     MATTHEW  E  BERGER     WASHINGTON  -  Jack  Abramoff  -  the  Washington  lobbyist  whose  guilty  plea  on  charges  of  corruption  led  to  the  resignation  this  week  of  the  Republican  leader  of  the  US  House  of  Representatives,  Tom  DeLay  -  had  extensive  ties  to  Jewish  and  Israeli  organisations  that  may  well  cause  embarrassment  in  the  coming  few  months,  according  to  Jewish  sources  in  Washington.   While  Abramoff  has  been  por-  trayed  as  a  man  willing  to  do  nearly  anything  to  further  his  political  goals  and  wallet,  he  also  has  been  an  idio-  syncratic  player  in  the  Jewish  commu-  nity  of  the  nation’s  capital,  starting  several  short-lived,  money-losing  ven-  tures  to  fill  religious  gaps  he  saw  in  the  city’s  Jewish  world.  He  also  used  his  largess  to  further  Israeli  businesses  and  charities  that  appealed  to  his  conserva-   tive  worldview.   Specifically,  Abramoff  is  accused  of  using  money  from  a  Washington  char-   ity  he  oversaw  to  fund  military-type  programs  in  the  West  Bank.  Native  American  tribes  donated  money  to  tax-exempt  charities,  believing  they  were  supporting  anti-gambling  foun-  dations,  but  the  money  was  redirected  to  help  a  “sniper  school”  in  the  West  Bank,  operated  by  a  friend  of   Abramoff.   Abramoff  also  allegedly  worked  on  behalf  of  an  Israeli  firm  that  sought  to  wire  the  Capitol  for  cellular  phone  use.  While  leading  cell  phone  manufactur-  ers  in  the  United  States  settled  on  JGC  Wireless  to  install  antennas  in   repeaters  in  House  buildings,  an  Israeli  company  with  ties  to  Abramoff,  Fox-  com  Wireless,  ultimately  won  the  bid.   Abramoff  also  has  been  tied  to  two   rabbis,  the  Lapin  brothers  from  South  Africa,  who  aided  his  political  and  per-  sonal  ventures.  David  Lapin  was  hired  to  run  a  Jewish  school  Abramoff  creat-  ed  in  suburban  Maryland  to  teach  his  children  and  others.  Lapin  also  received  close  to  $A1.6  million  to  pro-  mote  “ethics  in  government”  to  the   Sniper  schools  in  the  West  Bank?  Self-confessed  lobbyist  Jack  Abramoff  leaves  the   Federal  Court  in  Washington  last  week.

Two  other  Abramoff  aides  moved  to  Israel  last  year  as  investigators  contin-  ued  their  probe.   In  Washington,  Abramoff  was  best  known  for  his  idiosyncratic  use  of  his  money.  He  shunned  other  religious  schools  in  the  area,  choosing  to  open  Eshkol  Academy  specifically  for  his   children’s  education.  Abramoff  also  opened  several  kosher  restaurants  that  quickly  failed.   Some  Jewish  professionals  found  it  noteworthy  that  Abramoff  appeared  outside  a  Washington  courthouse  on  January  3  —  in  a  long,  double-breasted  black  coat  and  black  hat  -  resembling  a  devout  Jew  on  his  way  to  Shabbat   services.

"  Leslie  Caplan,  Jewish  giant,  dies  aged  74   DAN  GOLDBERG   THE  Australian  Jewish  community  lost  one  of  its  most  committed  leaders  this  week  when  Leslie   Caplan  died  on  Monday  night  -  his  74th  birthday  -  at  Wolper  Jewish  Hospital.   Caplan,  a  lawyer  by  trade,  was  admitted  to  hospital  five  weeks  ago   with  advanced  Parkinson’s  disease.   More  than  500  mourners  gath  ered  on  Wednesday  afternoon  for  a  memorial  service  at  North  Shore  Synagogue,  where  Rabbi  David  Rogut  delivered  the  eulogy  before  the  burial  at  Macquarie  Park  Cemetery.   Caplan  was  a  two-time  presi   dent  of  the  Executive  Council  for  Australian  Jewry  (1985-87  and  1989-92),  a  life  governor  of  Syd  ney’s  Jewish  Communal  Appeal  (JCA),  former  president  of  North  Shore  Synagogue  (1974-76),  a  founder  and  president  of  Masada  College  (1971-74)  and  president  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  (1982-85).  He  also  presided  over  the  historic  visit  to  Australia  by  Israeli  president  Chaim  Herzog  in   1986.

Photo:   Ai/V  file   Leslie  Caplan,  community  giant,  dies  at  74  f   CONTINUED  FROM  NEWS  1   Tributes  poured  in  this  week  for  a  man  described  by  some  of  his  closest  colleagues  as  ""unflappable”,  and  “outstanding”,  a  ""peace-maker”  and  a  “man  of  consensus”.   Isi  Leibler,  who  was  ECAJ  president  dur  ing  the  same  era,  said  Australian  Jewry  had  “lost  one  of  its  great  leaders”.   ""As  an  Australian  Jewish  leader,  he  made  an  indelible  contribution  during  the  critical  struggle  to  free  Soviet  Jews,”  Leibler  said  from  Jerusalem.  Describing  him  as  a  “peace-maker”,  he  said  Caplan  was  an  ""outstanding  Jewish  leader,  a  man  of  excep  tional  integrity,  a  dedicated  and  uncompro  mising  Jew”.   Dr  Joachim  Schneeweiss,  also  a  former  ECAJ  president,  recalled  Caplan  as  ""a  quiet  and  distinguished  achiever,  patient  in  listen   ing,  thoughtful  in  response  and  resolute  in  action”.  Caplan  was  “essentially  a  man  of   consensus”  who  was  “not  one  to  ruffle  feathers”,  Dr  Schneeweiss  said.   Peter  Wise,  who  worked  with  Caplan  at  the  JCA,  told  the  AJN:  “He  was  unflappable.  He  would  listen  to  all  sides  and  then  give  his  opinion  and  it  was  usually  his  opinion  that  swayed  everyone  else.  He  was  a  very  firm  chair  but  a  very  fair  chairf   Jeremy  Jones,  who  also  served  as  an  ECAJ  president,  recalled  the  Jewish  delega  tion  Caplan  led  to  the  historic  meeting  with  Pope  John  Paul  II  at  St  Mary’s  Cathedral  in  1986,  at  which  the  pontiff  first  characterised  antisemitism  as  “sinful”  for  all  Catholics.   Jones  also  credited  Caplan  for  “leading  the  charge”  to  urge  the  Hawke  Government  to  establish  the  Special  Investigations  Unit,  which  was  ultimately  set  up  in  1988  to   prosecute  alleged  Nazi  war  criminals  living  in  Australia.  But  he  said  Caplan's  main  lega  cy  were  the  dozens  of  people  he  encour  aged  in  the  community.  ""He  was  a  mentor  to  so  many  people,”  he  said.   Rabbi  Rogut  said  he  had  lost  a  “close  friend”  whom  he  had  visited  about  five  times  in  the  last  fortnight  He  recalled  how  Caplan  brought  him  to  Sydney  from  South  Africa  in  1974  when  he  was  president  of  North  Shore  Synagogue.  “He  was  strong  and  tough  on  all  issues,  [and]  he  was  able  to  walk  with  the  ordinary  man  as  he  walked  with  governor-generals  and  prime  ministers.”   Caplan  was  awarded  an  Order  of  Australia  in  1984  for  services  to  the  community.  He  is  survived  by  his  wife  Sophie,  three  sons  and  four  grandchildren.   \  NE3CT  WEEK  -  Obituary ",2006-08-18

One  much  closer  to  my  heart...  well,  actually  my  stomach.  And  I’m  not  just  going  to  sit  back  and  take  it.   I  have  bunkered  down  in  my  kitchen,  which  I  decided  to  rename  the  “war  room”.  If  any  of  you  have  had  the  misfortune  of  me  cooking  for  you,  you  are  probably  thinking:  “Hold  on,  isn’t  it  already  the  war  room?”  Well  yes,  but  this  time  I  intend  it  to  be.   Unlike  most  other  such  nerve  centres,  mine  is  conveniently  stocked  with  a  fridge,  stove  and  pantry.  It  is  a  truly  Jewish  war  room.  One  of  which  my  grandmother  would  be  proud.  And  in  which  I  think  I  have  stum  bled  upon  the  crux  of  this  entire  conflict.

If  all  it  has  taken  thus  far  to  cause  a  food  to  be  renamed  was  some  minor  slight  -  a  refusal  to  join  a  premature  war,  the  publica  tion  of  some  silly  cartoons  -  then  I  .  figure,  as  a  Jew  who  is  somewhat  J  A  partial  to  Israel  there’s  a  whole  yMm.   host  of  worthy  culinary  candidates  on  which  to  set  my  sights.   Such  as  the  Belgian  waffle.  Now  I  don’t  know  what  possessed  Belgium  to  hear  the  Sharon  case  at  all,  but  in  these  extra-sensi  tive  times  for  the  big  old  hawk,  I  think  we  owe  him  the  courtesy  of  striking  back  at  Belgium  the  only  way  we  know  how.  Behold,  ladies:  and  gentlemen,  the  Kadima  cake.  Available  soon  at  a  Glick’s  near  you.  And  w©  all  know  who  is  supplying  nukes  to  Iran  and  pouring  moolah  to  the  mullahs  in  Gaza,  so  goodbye  Russian  caviar,  hello  Bobba  balls.  Come  on,  it’s  still  more  appetising  than  aborted  fish   eggs.   Any  good  war  these  days  appears  to  be  fought  on  pre-emptive  lines.  So  while  Turkey  and  Lebanon  are  our  friends  right  now,  and  I  am  particularly  partial  to  Turkish  delight  and  Lebanese  bread  (though  seldom  at  the  same  time),  I  figure  it  is  my  duty  to  divest  them  of  their  national  associations.   So  right  now  I’m  gorging  on  Dizengoff  delight,  with  a  pile  of  burnt  flour  -  hey,  let’s  call  a  spade  a  spade  -  beside  me.  And  I’m  sorry,  I  still  don’t  forgive  the  Poles,  and  I  absolutely  adore  pickles.  So  fare  ye  well  Polski  Ogorki,  bring  on  the  David  Ben-Gurkhin.   I  have  hit  one  slight  snag  -  Israeli  salad.  After  all,  who  is  more  critical  of  Israeli  political   decisions  than  Jews  and   Israelis  themselves?   Disengagement,  right  of  return,  you  name  it,  we  argue  about  it.  So  what   can  we  possibly  call   that  colourful,  ill-fit  ting  mess  of  cucumber,  tomato  and  onion?  Wait,  I’ve  got  it:  Israeli  salad!   Guess  it’s  back  to  the  drawing  board  for   me.

"  OBITUARY   A  proud  Australian  Jew   SEND  OBITUARIES  TO  jrobuck@jewishnews.netau   NAOMI  MEYER  AND  JONATHAN  WOLF   RALPH  Meyer  was  bom  in  Duisburg,  Germany  in  1929  to  Ernst  and  Gretel  Meyer.  He  had  the  good  fortune  to  arrive  in  Australia  with  his  widowed  mother  and  sister  Liesel  just   before  Kristallnacht  in  1938.   One  of  Ralph’s  most  treasured  possessions   was  the  letter  from  the  Australian  Government   granting  his  family  a  visa,  and  he  never  missed  an  opportunity  to  remind  those  dose  to  him  of  how  lucky  they  were  to  be  living  in  such  a  won  derful  country.   While  he  worked  successfully  as  an  importer  of  dectrical  components,  Ralph’s  primary  role  was  patriarch  of  the  family.  He  and  his  wife  Milli  provided  a  traditional  Jewish  home  for  their  daughters  Karen  and  Jennifer.  Sadly  Milli  passed  away  while  the  children  were  very  young.   He  was  fortunate  to  find  great  happiness  and  fulfilment  with  his  second  wife  Ellen,  and  much  nachas  from  their  daughter  Naomi.   Ralph  was  a  Yekke  -  a  typical  German  Jew.  Precision,  punctuality  and  perfect  table  man  ners  were  essential.  He  was  knowledgeable,  a  great  storyteller  and  appredated  beauty  in  nature,  art  and  music.   His  grandchildren  fondly  recall  trips  with  their  grandparents  to  Balmoral  Beach,  visits  to  Garry  and  Nola  Braude’s  chemist  stop  for  jelly  beans,  and  learning  to  fish  off  the  jetty  at   Hunters  Hill.   RALPH  MEYER   1929-2006   Ralph  always  ensured  that  the  family  spent  Shabbat  together,  and  led  the  seder  every  Pesach.  His  presence  was  keenly  felt  at  this  year’s  seder,  as  he  passed  away  just  a  few  days   before  Pesach.   His  generosity,  honesty  and  fairness  were  inspirational  to  his  family  and  all  who  knew   him.   This  was  an  extract  from  the  eulogy  delivered  at   Ralph  Meyer’s  funeral  by  his  daughter  Naomi   Meyer  and  grandson  Jonathan  Wolf. ",2006-05-26
"  Who’s  living  an  incomplete  Jewish  life?   LARRY  DERFNER  ponders   issues  raised  by  AB  Yehoshua  comparing  Jewish  life  in  Israel  and  the  Diaspora.   |  I  don’t  think  that  the   more  Jewish  life  is   necessarily  the  better   one;  religion  brings  out  the  best  in  some  Jews   and  the  worst  in  others,  and  so  does  living  in  Israel.   AB  Yehoshua  ...  Diaspora  Jews  may  be  living  a  “partial”  existence.   !AM  a  secular  American-Israeli   Jew.  I’m  an  atheist.  But  I  think  anybody  taking  an  objective,  dis  interested  view  of  the  life  I  live   would  have  to  say  it  s  a  Jewish  lite.   I’m  a  citizen  of  the  Jewish  State,  all  my  neighbours  are  Jewish,  I  deal  almost  solely  with  Jews  in  the  course  of  a  day  (which  drives  me  nuts,  I  wish  there  were  some  gentiles  around).  I  speak  Hebrew.  My  children  grow  up  learning  not  only  about  Israel,  but  also  about  Judaism.   We  celebrate  the  Jewish  holidays,  and  even  go  occasionally  to  a  Reform  synagogue  -  strictly  for  the  kids’  sake,  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  for  my  wife’s  sake.  For  myself,  synagogue  has  never  been  anything  but  a  bore.   Yet  regardless  of  my  secularism,  even  my  atheism,  the  fact  that  I’m  a  Jew  living  in  Israel,  surrounded  by  Jews  and  participating  in  the  daily  life  of  the  Jewish  State,  makes  the  life  I’m  living  a  Jewish  one.   Now  let’s  take  my  brother  and  sis  ter-in-law  and  their  children  living  in  Toronto,  Canada.  They  are  ultra  Orthodox  Jews,  living  according  to  Jewish  law.  My  brother-in-law  studies  in  yeshiva  before  work,  my  sister-in  law  teaches  at  the  synagogue  kinder  garten,  my  nephews  and  nieces  study  in  yeshiva.  They  all  dress  like  ultra  religious  Jews  and  they  live  in  a  heav  ily  Orthodox  neighbourhood.  Their  behaviour  is  marked  by  a  modesty,  generosity  and  ultra-conservatism  that  obviously  reflects  their  religious  beliefs  and  practices.   Anybody  taking  an  objective,  dis  interested  view  of  my  relatives’  life  in  Toronto  would  call  that  a  Jewish  life.  Anybody  who  just  sees  them  would   know  it.   Even  AB  Yehoshua,  the  scourge  of  the  Diaspora,  would  never  suggest  that  my  in-laws’  life  isn’t  a  Jewish  one.  However,  based  on  his  recent,  highly  controversial  remarks,  he  would  say   A  group  of  new  Russian  Immigrants  who  arrived  in  Haifa  from  the  Russian  Black   Sea  port  of  Odessa.  Photo:  Isranet   that  my  in-laws  are  living  a  “partial”  or  “incomplete”  Jewish  life.  A  com  plete  Jewish  life,  as  far  as  he  is  con  cerned,  can  only  be  lived  in  Israel.   I  think  he’d  be  right  about  my  in  laws  -  they  are  living  an  incomplete  Jewish  life  because  they’re  living  in  the  Diaspora,  not  Israel.   Like  Yehoshua,  I  think  all  Jews  in  the  Diaspora,  even  the  most  religious  of  them,  are  living  only  partial  Jewish  lives.  Life  is  not  only  personal,  it’s  also  public,  it’s  also  national,  and  the  only  country  where  one  can  live  a  public,  national  life  that’s  fully  Jewish  is   Israel.   But  what  about  the  personal  side  of  Jewish  life?  Is  it  possible  to  say  that  one’s  personal  life  is  Jewish  if  he  is  basically  indifferent  or  maybe  even  disdainful  toward  Judaism?  Not  nec  essarily  as  a  subject  for  study,  but  as  a  belief  in  God  and  a  practice  of  that   belief?  Judaism,  the  Jewish  religion  -  isn’t  that  also  a  vital  part  of  the  Jewish  life,  the  personal  Jewish  life?  Even  if  you’re  a  Jew  living  in  Israel?   I  think  it  is.   I  think  all  of  us  secular  Jews  in  Israel  -  including  Yehoshua,  who   referred  to  “the  dull  and  worn-out   value  of  Jewish  spirituality”  -  are  also  living  incomplete  Jewish  lives.   In  fact,  I’d  say  my  in-laws  in  Thornhill,  Toronto,  and  other  seri  ously-religious  Jews  in  the  Diaspora  —   Orthodox  or  non-Orthodox  -  are  liv   ing  a  more  Jewish  life.   We’re  just  living  a  more  Israeli  life.  It’s  a  Jewish  life,  too,  but  the  Jewish  part  is  in  the  outer  shell,  in  the  public,  national,  Israeli-Jewish  part  of  our  identity.   For  serious  religious  Jews  in  the  Diaspora  -  people  whose  days  revolve  around  Jewish  law,  prayer,  mitzvot   and  usually  religious  study  as  well  -  Judaism  isn’t  in  the  outer  shell  of  their  lives,  it’s  in  the  core.  It  suffuses  their  personal  life,  and  usually  their  com   munal  life  as  well.   Yes,  their  lives  would  be  more  completely  Jewish  if  they  lived  in   Israel.  But  the  lives  of  secular  Israeli  Jews  would  be  so  much  more  Jewish  -  completely  Jewish  -  if  we  were  reli  gious.   Look  at  your  typical  Orthodox  Jew  in  the  Diaspora,  then  look  at  your  typical  secular  Jew  in  Israel.  I’ll  make  it  easier:  look  at  a  Diaspora  Orthodox  Jewish  wedding,  then  look  at  an  Israeli  secular  Jewish  wedding.  Which  is  more  Jewish?  Who  has  further  to  go  on  the  road  to  a  complete  Jewish  life?   You  may  be  thinking:  “So,  Mr  Atheist,  why  don’t  you  become  a  reli  gious  Jew?”   My  answer  is  that  while  I’ve  been  exposed  to  Judaism  and  am  interested  in  it,  I’ve  become  absolutely  con  vinced  that  I  don’t  believe  in  it  and   that  religion  -  any  religion  -  is  not  for  me.  Furthermore,  I  don’t  think  that  the  more  Jewish  life  is  necessarily  the  better  one;  religion  brings  out  the  best  in  some  Jews  and  the  worst  in  others,  and  so  does  living  in  Israel.   But  whatever  I  think  of  Judaism  or  Zionism,  it  doesn’t  mean  I  have  to  deny  the  obvious  -  that  in  Jewish  life,  devotion  to  the  religion  of  Judaism  is  at  least  equal  in  importance  to  citi  zenship  in  the  Jewish  State.   Imagine  the  Jewish  Diaspora  with  out  the  State  of  Israel.  Then  imagine  a  100-per-cent-secular  State  of  Israel  in  a  whole  world  without  any  practising,  believing  Jews.  Obviously  I  wouldn’t  want  to  choose  either  one,  but  if  I  had  to,  as  an  atheist  Israeli  but  also  a  Jew,  I’d  choose  the  former.   In  Jewish  life,  as  in  any  other  way  of  life,  the  core  is  more  important  than  the  shell.   JERUSALEM  POST ",2006-05-26

"  SETTLING  DISPUTES,  THE  JEWISH  WAY     RABBI  BERELWEIN  sees   nothing  new  in  the  differences   that  characterise  contemporary  Jewish  society.     The  rise  of  Reform,   Haskala  and  secular  Zionism,  however,   created  a  much  deeper  rift  within  the  Jewish   world.  These  movements   were  operating  outside  the  framework  of  traditional  Jewish   thought,  belief  and  practice.     ONE  of  the  strong  points  of  Jew-   ish  life  over  the  centuries  has  been  its  lack  of  conformity  -  its  diversity.   But  diversity  is  different  to  plural-  ism,  which  intimates  that  everybody  (and  every  belief,  or  lack  thereof)  is  “right”  and  acceptable.  Rather,  Judaism  and  everyday  Jewish  life  has  operated  within  a  framework  of  belief   in  monotheism  and  the  revelation  at  Sinai,  the  divinity  of  the  oral  law,  the  importance  of  traditions  and  customs  and  the  tolerance  of  a  flexible  spec-  trum  of  actual  observance  of  the  com-  mandments  and  rituals  of  the  Torah.   Within  this  framework,  there  was   still  plenty  of  room  for  disputes,  dif-  fering  customs,  halachic  opinions  and  varying  responses  to  the  pressures  and  ideas  of  the  far  larger  non-Jewish  world  in  which  Jews  actually  lived.  Much  of  the  time,  these  debates  and  arguments  were  conducted  in  a  civil  and  scholarly  fashion.   However,  there  were  always  instances  when  the  disagreements  got  out  of  hand  and  verbal  and  social  abuse  occurred,  sometimes  even  accompanied  by  physical  violence.  This  was  especially  true  when  new  forces  and  ideas  emerged,  again  all  within  the  general  framework  of  Judaism  that  I  described  above.   Thus  the  rise  of  the  Chassidic  movement  in  18th-century  Eastern  Europe,  of  Hirschian  neo-Orthodoxy  in  19th-century  Germany,  of  the  yeshiva  movement  and  later  the  Mus-   sar  movement  that  came  to  dominate  the  19th-  and  early  20th-century  yeshivot,  all  were  sources  of  argument,  controversy  and  fierce  debate  within   the  ranks  of  traditional  Ashkenazi   Jewry.  The  great  Jewish  mantra,  that   what  common  sense  cannot  accom-   plish,  the  passage  of  time  eventually  achieves,  certainly  proved  true  in  all  of  these  cases.  All  these  matters  have   pretty  much  been  settled,  or  reduced  to  scholarly  debate  and  discussion.   The  rise  of  Reform,  Haskala  and  secular  Zionism,  however,  created  a  much  deeper  rift  within  the  Jewish  world.  These  movements  were  operat-  ing  outside  the  framework  of  tradi-  tional  Jewish  thought,  belief  and  practice.  They  denied  the  basic  prem-  ises  of  millennia-old  Jewish  life.  The  Torah  was  no  longer  divine,  the  oral  law  was  a  fiction  of  the  rabbis,  and  observance  of  tradition  and  any  forms  of  ritual  was  unnecessary.  Effectively,  our  ancestors  were  liars  and  fools.   Because  of  the  radicalism  inherent  in  these  assertions,  opposition  from  the  traditional  camp  to  these  new  groupings  within  the  Jewish  people   was  fierce,  prolonged  and  basically  uncivil.  In  the  rough-and-tumble  practicality  of  human  intercourse  and  society,  insults  beget  insults  and  vio-  lence  begets  violence.  Civilly  con-  ducted  disagreement  upon  basic  points  of  faith  and  definitions  of  Judaism  and  the  Jewish  mission  in  the  world  became  almost  nonexistent.   These  struggles  spilled  over  secondar-  ily  into  the  traditional  Jewish  world,  with  great  quarrels  between  rabbis,   scholars  and  believers  themselves.   There  were  many  bitter  disputes  that  occurred  in  Jewish  history  before  the  rise  of  the  radical  movements  within  Jewish  life  of  the  modem  era.  The  Sadducees,  Karaites  and  false  messiahs  all  engendered  fierce  oppo-  sition  in  the  Jewish  world.  Again,  this  was  because  of  the  radicalism  of  these  ideas  and  movements,  and  of  the  threat  they  posed  to  the  traditional  Jewish  beliefs  and  way  of  life.   But  the  tradition  of  civil  dispute  was  greatly  undermined  by  the  split  within  traditional  Jewry  over  the  Zionist  movement.  Religious  Zion-  ism  became  the  main  focal  point  of  dispute  within  traditional  Eastern  European  Jewry  in  the  years  before  World  War  II.  The  deeply-held  con-  victions  on  both  sides  and  the  loom-   ing  importance  of  the  issue   intensified  the  debate  and  sharpened  the  means  by  which  it  was  being  held.   The  ideological  and  social  disputes  of  the  past  became  entrenched  in  the  political  party  system  of  the  State  of  Israel.  The  pressure  of  constant  elec-  tions  and  the  struggle  for  power,  patronage  and  budget  allocations,  which  is  the  stuff  of  modern-day  democratic  electioneering,  soured  the  hopes  for  civil  disagreement  in  our  country.  Negative  campaigning,  smears  and  innuendos,  populist  slo-  gans  and  public  relations,  spin  doctors  and  pollsters  created  an  atmosphere  that  does  not  easily  allow  for  a  true  debate  of  programs  and  policies.   Instead,  a  shouting  match  ensued,  one  that  has  lasted  for  the  entire  near   58-year  existence  of  our  state.  The  Torah  allowed  for  civil  debate  and  disagreements.  But  it  always  came  to  remind  us  that  “its  ways  are  the  ways  of  pleasantness”.   As  we  embark  on  the  current  elec-   tion  campaign  in  Israel,  we  would  do   well  to  remind  ourselves  that  our   country  needs  a  good  deal  of  “pleas-  antness”,  and  attempt  to  have  a  civil  discussion  of  the  issues,  even  though  there  are  great  disagreements  about  them  and  the  possible  solutions  to  our  problems.

"  New  Dutch  ambassador  s  Jewish  links  run  deep   GEDAL1AH  AFTERMAN   AMBASSADORS  come  and  go,  but  newly-appointed  Dutch  Ambassador  to  Australia  Niek  van  Zutphen  has  wasted  no  time  cementing  his  own  personal  connection  with  the  Aus  tralian  Jewish  community.   Not  only  was  the  Netherlands  the  only  country  to  open  its  borders  to  Jews  for  24  hours  after  the  events  of  Kristallnacht  —  November  9,  1938  —   but  Van  Zutphen’s  parents  also  hid  Jews  in  their  small  Amsterdam  apart  ment  during  the  Holocaust  and  ran  an  orphanage  for  Jewish  children,  some  of  whom  have  immigrated  to  Aus  tralia,  until  well  into  the  1960s.   ""My  parents  started  as  caretakers  [of  the  orphanage]  and  stayed  until  1965,  the  year  when  the  last  Jewish  war  orphan  turned  21,”  he  told  the  AJN  in  his  Canberra  office  last  week.   However,  Van  Zutphen  said  his  parents  never  sought  praise  for  “carry  ing  out  their  human  duties”.  To  them,  he  said,  sheltering  Jews  was  a  family  affair,  with  his  grandparents  having  performed  the  same  selfless  act  in  their   homes.   Still,  in  1966,  YadVashem  recognised  them  as  Righteous  Among  the  Nations.  The  couple  attended  a  ceremony  at  the  Jerusalem  Holocaust  memorial,  where  a  tree  was  planted  in  their  honour.   Dutch  Ambassador  fflek  van  Zutphen...  his  parents  saved  Jews  (hiring  the  Holocaust   During  a  visit  to  Washington  a  few  years  ago,  Van  Zutphen  recalls  visiting  the  Holocaust  Memorial  Museum  and  seeing  his  parents’  names  on  a  wall  commemorating  those  who  helped  save  Jews  during  the  war.   They  were  “courageous  in  making  their  own  choices  instead  of  following  the  majority”,  he  said.   Last  month  in  Sydney,  he  was  reunited  with  one  of  the  orphans,  Joseph  Vissel,  who  immigrated  to  Aus  tralia  via  Israel,  where  he  met  his  Eng  lish-born  wife.   “My  mother  went  to  London  for   the  wedding  [in  1960]  as  he  [Vissel]  had  no-one,”  Van  Zutphen  said.   Van  Zutphen  was  first  reunited  with  Vissel  at  a  reunion  in  Amsterdam  two  years  ago  for  many  of  the  orphans  cared  for  by  his  parents.  It  was  the  first   time  the  two  men  had  met  in  more  than  45  years.   At  the  “emotional”  meeting  in  Syd  ney,  Vissel  gave  Van  Zutphen  a  black  and-white  photograph  he  took  of  Jom  Utzon,  the  designer  of  the  Sydney  Opera  House.  The  photo  recently  fea  tured  as  part  of  an  exhibition  titled  National  Treasures  at  the  National  Library  in  Canberra.   But  the  ambassador’s  links  to  Judaism  and  Jews  go  even  deeper.  The  Jewish  father  of  his  wife,  Miriam,  was  sent  to  a  Dutch  transport  camp  but  managed  to  survive  the  Holocaust,  while  her  grandparents  were  sent  to  Bergen  Belsen.  They  escaped  death  and  were  eventually  sent  to  Algeria.   Van  Zutphen  started  his  career  at  the  Dutch  Foreign  Ministry  in  1972  with  the  European  Integration  Department  In  1989,  he  had  his  first  foreign  posting  to  Madrid  as  minister  plenipotentiary.  His  first  posting  as  an  ambassador  was  in  1997  to  Caracas,  Venezuela.  In  1999,  he  was  sent  to  Helsinki,  Finland,  before  arriving  in  Australia  in  January  this  year.

Film  review   BORAT   Reviewed  by  Don  Perlgut   USED  to  think  that  Sacha  Baron  Cohen  was  a  moderately  talented  British  comic  who  occasionally  pushed  the  envelope  with  his  Ali  G  character.   After  seeing  his  new  film,  Borat:  Cultural  Learnings  of  America  For  Make  Benefit  Glorious  Nation  of  Kazakhstan,  my  opinion  has  changed:  I  am  now  in  awe  of  what  this  Jewish  comedian  can  do.   As  co-writer  and  star,  Cohen  has  created  one  of  the  most  hilarious,  politically  incorrect  and  decisively  satiric  films  in  many  years.   Cohen  plays  Borat  Sagdiyev  -  the  “son  of  Asimbala  and  Boltok  the  rapist”  -  a  reporter  for  Kazakhstan  television  sent  to  America  to  film  a  documentary.   He  comes  from  a  desperately  poor  Kazakh  village  which  we  see  in  the  opening  and  clos  ing  scenes  (and  which  was  shot  in  Romania),  where  they  “have  three  problems:  the  econ  omy,  the  social  and  the  Jew”.  With  that,  Borat  nails  his  colours  to  the  wall  -  he  is  a  casual  and  thorough  antisemite  (as  well  as  a  misogynist).   In  an  early  scene  from  his  village,  he  reports  on  the  “running  of  the  Jew”,  where  large  antisemitic  mock-ups  of  a  Jewish  man  and  woman  are  systematically  harassed  through  the  streets.   Borat  follows  in  the  tradition  of  a  mocku   mentary,  a  parody  documentary  popularised  by  Rob  Reiner  in  This  is  Spinal  Tap,  but  with  a  peculiar  and  ironic  twist:  most  of  the  film  is  a  real  documentary,  with  unwitting  subjects  thinking  that  they  are  being  interviewed  by  a  real  Kazakh  reporter.   After  arriving  in  New  York,  Borat  and  his  producer  Azamat  Bagatov  (Ken  Davitian,  fre  quently  speaking  in  Armenian)  head  off  on  a  road  trip  to  Los  Angeles,  in  search  of  Baywatch  star  Pamela  Anderson.   Later  scenes  -  some  of  which  have  already  entered  popular  movie  folklore  via  the  inter  net  -  include  Borat  asking  a  gunstore  clerk  which  is  the  best  gun  for  shooting  Jews  (his  straight  response  is  bone  chilling),  and  a  drunken  car  ride  with  frat  boys,  who  com  plain  that  the  world  is  being  taken  over  by  women,  ethnics  and  Jews.   In  expressing  antisemitism,  Cohen  runs  a  considerable  risk  of  being  taken  at  face  value  because  Borat  operates  on  two  very  distinct  levels  -  it’s  a  laugh-out-loud  physical  comedy  with  toilet  humour  (literally),  naked  wrestling  and  a  deeply  prejudiced  but  simplistic  lead  character;  but  underneath  it’s  a  multi-layered  satire  on  American  values  and  prejudices,  and   our  reactions  to  them.   Only  a  small  number  of  non-Jewish  viewers  will  get  the  joke  that  his  Borat  character  is  fre  quently  speaking  Hebrew  when  supposedly  speaking  Kazakh.  This  operates  as  a  “wink  wink”  to  Jewish  viewers.  We  can  also  identify   with  Borat  as  an  outsider.   Inflammatory  Kazakh!  journalist  Borat  (played  by  Sacha  Baron  Cohen)  botches  the  American  national   anthem  at  a  baseball  game  in  Texas.  Photo:  Twentieth  Century  Fox   Cohen  has  cleverly  drawn  from  other  Jewish  comics  in  his  use  and  fascination  with  antisemitism.  Woody  Allen’s  character  in  Annie  Hall  was  obsessed  with  it,  and  Mel  Brooks  used  the  comic  antisemite  to  great  effect  in  The  Producers.  We  can  also  detect  shades  of  comedian  Lenny  Bruce  and  Austen  Tayshus’  rage  against  anti-Jewish  bigotry  in   Borut.   Cohen  also  proves  to  be  an  extraordinary  physical  comic,  with  a  strong  resonance  to  Ben  Stiller’s  characters  in  There's  Something  About  Mary,  Zoolander  and  Meet  the  Parents.   Some  scenes  are  almost  reproduced  straight  from  other  Jewish  comedies.  When  Borat  accidentally  trashes  part  of  an  antique  shop,  it  appears  to  be  choreographed  and  timed  exactly  as  Woody  Allen’s  character  trashed  his  flat  in  Play  It  Again  Sam.  And  when  Borat  goes  to  a  Christian  revival  meeting  and  gets  “saved”,  I  immediately  thought  of  an   identical  scene  in  John  Safran’s  recent  Australian  television  series,  John  Safran  vs  God.  When  Azamat  appears  dressed  up  like  Charlie  Chaplin,  Borat  comments  that  he  does  not  want  to  see  someone  who  looks  like  Hitler,  a  direct  reference  to  Chaplin’s  classic,  The  Great  Dictator.   Cohen,  and  his  director  Larry  Charles  (Seinfeld),  know  exactly  what  they  are  doing.  As  a  result,  Borat  achieves  something  few  movies  do:  wrapped  in  simplicity,  it’s  a  deeply  thought  out  satire.  Most  popular  movies  do  the  opposite.  Their  apparent  complexity  only  hides  the  bankruptcy  of  ideas  at  the  core.

"  Tiny  Jamaican  Jewish  community  marks  350  years   BEN  FRANK   KINGSTON  -  Jamaica’s  tiny  Jewish  community  will  mark  its  350th  anniversary  next  week  with  the  open  ing  of  a  new  Jamaican  Jewish  Heritage   Centre.   Some  150-200  Jews  live  on  the  Caribbean  island  of  three  million   inhabitants.  Mostly  intermarried  and  interracial,  the  community  has  had  no  rabbi  for  25  years  and  no  kosher  butcher  for  50  years.  But  the  once  strong  community  will  nonetheless  gather  on  November  9  at  the  elegant,  100-year-old  Sha’are  Shalom  syna  gogue  on  Duke  Street  in  Kingston  to  mark  its  350th  anniversary.  Govemor  'i  General  Kenneth  Hall  and  Prime  ;i  Minister  Portia  Simpson  Miller  are  l  expected  to  attend.   £   Jamaica  played  a  part  in  founding  and  supporting  the  American  Jewish  community.  The  first  Jews  came  to  the  island  in  1654,  after  their  ship  -  on  its  way  from  Recife,  Brazil,  to  Holland  -  was  waylaid  by  Spanish  frigates.  Taken  to  Jamaica,  the  Jews  were  held  for  vio  lating  the  laws  of  the  Inquisition,  and  were  freed  only  when  23  of  them  proved  they  were  not  Marranos.  This  group  then  sailed  to  Dutch  New  Ams  terdam  -  later  New  York  -  becoming  the  first  Jews  to  land  in  America.  Over  the  next  century,  Jamaican  Jewry  financially  aided  the  fledgling  Jewish  community  in  America.   Former  synagogue  president  Ainsley  Henriques,  whose  family  has  been  there  since  1740,  said  the  com  munity  dates  its  founding  to  the  arrival  of  the  British  in  1655,  when   several  Jews  helped  seize  the  island  from  the  Spanish.  By  1750,1000  Jews  lived  on  the  island.  They  saw  Jamaica  as  a  place  where  they  could  live  peace  fully.  In  fact,  so  many  Jews  won  elec  tive  posts  there  that  in  1849,  the  Jamaican  Assembly  adjourned  for  Yom  Kippur.  By  1881,2535  Jews  called  Jamaica  home.   Jamaica  gained  independence  in  1962  and  many  Jews  left  during  the  political  unrest  of  the  1970s,  mostly  heading  for  Miami  and  Canada.   But  Shabbat  and  holiday  services,  as  well  as  life-cycle  events,  are  still  held  in  the  Kingston  synagogue,  whose   services  are  a  combination  of  Reform  and  Conservative  with  Caribbean  aspects,  such  as  the  sandy  floor  used  in  a  few  other  synagogues  in  the  Caribbean.

"  Jewish  ALP  candidate   emerges  from  the  south   MARK  FRANKLIN   MICHELLE  Miran  stands  to  become  the  only  Jewish  mem  ber  in  the  NSW  Legislative  Assembly,  but  it’s  not  Vauduse,  Woollahra  or  Waverley  that  she’ll  contest  at  next  year’s  poll.   Rather,  she  will  run  for  office  in  the  Yiddishe  backwater  seat  of  the  South  Coast,  which  comprises  the  Shoalhaven  area  and  is  home  to  no  more  than  100  Jews.   After  winning  Labor  prese  lection  last  month,  Miran  believes  she  has  an  “excellent”  chance  of  wresting  the  seat  from  Liberal  member  Shelley  Hancock,  who  daimed  it  by  a  mere  1.6  per  cent  in  2003.   While  a  Jewish  woman  will  represent  Labor  in  such  an  unlikely  seat,  the  party  is  yet  to  find  a  candidate  for  Vaucluse,  the  seat  with  the  largest  Jewish  population  in  the  state.   Labor’s  head  office  has  asked  Walt  Secord,  who  served  as  an  adviser  to  former  premier  Bob  Carr  and  prior  to  that  worked  at  the  AJN,  to  stand.  But  Secord  is  yet  to  dedde  whether  he  will  contest  the  safe   Michelle  Mlran:  “I've  always  had  a  very  strong  sense  of  Justice  and  of  what’s  fair  and  light.”   Liberal  seat,  which  is  currently  held  by  Opposition  Leader   Peter  Debnam.   Miran,  meanwhile,  grew  up  in  Sydneys  Bellevue  Hill  -  “the  ghetto”  as  she  calls  it  -  but  “escaped”  15  years  ago  to  Shoalhaven,  where  she  bought  seven-acres  and  indulged  her  love  of  equestrian  sports.   “My  interests  have  always  been  always  outside  those  of  a  typical  Jewish  princess,”  she  quips,  “although  my  gene  for  shopping  and  jewellery  remains  firmly  intact”.   Currently  working  as  a  busi   ness  development  manager  at  the  Department  of  State  and  Regional  Development,  Miran,  54,  believes  she  is  able  to  “make  a  huge  contribution”  to  the  Shoalhaven  area.   She  credits  her  Jewish  upbringing  for  inspiring  her  involvement  in  politics.  “I’ve  always  had  a  very  strong  sense  of  justice  and  of  what’s  foir  and  right  in  this  world,”  she  says.  “I’m  not  a  person  that  stands   outside  and  looks  in.”   However,  Miran  is  not  the  area’s  first  Jewish  political  iden  tity.  The  first  mayor  of  Nowra,  Henry  Moss,  and  one  of  the  area’s  early  pioneers,  Michael  Hyam,  whose  name  is  pre  served  in  Jervis  Bay’s  Hyams  Beach,  were  both  Jewish.   Although  very  few  Jews  cur  rently  live  in  Shoalhaven,  its  Yiddishe  star  seems  to  be  rising.   Last  year,  a  small  South  Coast  Jewish  community  began  to  blossom,  prompted  by   visits  from  Chabad  of  Rural  and  Regional  Australia  and  some  industrious  networking  by  a  local  Jewish  woman,   Deanne  Rosenthal.

His  film  offends  Just  about  everyone,  including  Jews.  Photo:  AP/AAP   Could  Borat  be  ‘best  anti-Jewish  film5?   DAN  GOLDBERG   BORAT,  the  acclaimed  alter  ego  of  Jewish  comedian  Sacha  Baron  Cohen,  brought  his  anti-everyone  mockumentary  to  Australia  this  week,  touting  it  as  a  contender  for  the  “best  anti-Jewish  film”  at  next  year’s  Academy  Awards.   At  a  carefully  stage-managed  press  conference  at  the  Sydney  Opera  House  on  Monday,  Borat  said  he  hoped  his  film,  Borat:  Cultural  Learn  ings  of  America  For  Make  Benefit  of  Glorious  Nation  of  Kazakhstan,  would  be  nominated  for  an  Oscar,  although  he  cautioned  that  there   would  be  “a  stiff  contest  from  your   Melvin  Gibson”.   “I  would  like  to  say  that  we  in  Kazakhstan  fully  support  the  state  ment  given  of  Mr  Gibson  when  he  say  that  the  Jews  started  all  the  wars.   “We  also  have  proof  that  it  was  the  Jews  that  were  responsible  for  the  end  of  the  dinosaur  period.”   Surrounded  by  the  national  flags   of  Australia  and  Kazakhstan  in  a  set   ting  that  was  more  appropriate  for  a  president  than  a  bumbling  spoof  reporter,  Borat  said  the  Kazakhi  cen  sor  only  released  the  film  after  decid  ing  it  contained  “just  enough   antisemitism”.   The  press  conference  was  pre  scripted,  with  media  requested  to  submit  questions  for  approval  last   week.   Borat  also  appeared  in  Melbourne,  where  his  film  was  screened  at  the  Jam  Factory  on  Wednesday  night.   Asked  how  he  reacted  to  accusa  tions  that  his  film  is  offensive  to  Jews,  a  beaming  Borat  said:  “Thank  you  very  much.

"  PRAGUE  MARKS  CENTENARY   ANNIVERSARY  OF  JEWISH  MUSEUM   PRAGUE  -  The  Jewish  Museum  in  Prague  is  celebrating  its  100th  anniversary  with  a  year-long  program  of  concerts  and  exhibi-  tions.  About  100  theatres,  concert  halls,  gal-  leries  and  other  institutions  across  the  Czech  Republic  will  participate  in  the  proj-  ect,  which  will  present  important  works  of  Jewish  art  to  the  public  throughout  the  year,  museum  director  Leo  Pavlat  said.   ""It  will  show  that  the  Jewish  culture  in  our  country  had  not  only  a  very  rich  past  but  also  has  a  lively  present,”  Pavlat  said.   The  National  Theatre  in  Brno  will  put  on  a  performance  of  Hans  Krasa’s  opera  Brundibar  in  November,  according  to  the  theatre’s  director,  Zdenek  Prosek.   The  opera  for  children  had  55  perform-  ances  in  the  Jewish  ghetto  in  Theresien-  stadt,  outside  Prague,  where  Krasa  spent  two  years  before  being  transported  in  1944  to  Auschwitz,  where  he  died.

Prague’s  Jewish  Museum  was  founded  in  1906,  but  was  closed  to  the  public  after  the  1939  Nazi  occupation  of  Czech  territo-  ry.  In  1942,  the  Nazis  formed  a  central  museum  here  where  works  of  art  from  all  closed  Czech  synagogues  and  Jewish  com-  munities  were  deposited.

"  Cover  story   A  narrowing  scene  from  Lena  Einhom’s  Holocaust-themed  film,  Nina’s  Journey.   From  Holocaust-themed  documentaries  to  family  dramas,  the  2006  Festival  of  Jewish  Cinema  will  showcase  works  by  17  Jewish  film-makers  who  are  making  their  mark   around  the  world.  Jan  Epstein  spoke  to  three  -  an  Argentinean,  a  Swede  and  a  Pole.   IF  the  program  for  this  year’s   Festival  of  Jewish  Cinema,  which  opens  in  Sydney  this  week,  is  any  thing  to  go  by,  Jewish  film-making  is  alive  and  well,  with  directors  from  around  the  world  continuing  to  chron  icle  the  Jewish  experience  in  ground  breaking  films.   Most  of  the  17  films  at  this  year’s  festival  have  brought  their  Jewish  themes  into  the  public  domain  through  international  film  festivals,  where  many  have  won  prizes  and  others  have  tasted  success  at  home.  Take  Lena  Einhom’s  Nina's  Journey,  for  example.   Einhom  is  a  prolific  Swedish  docu  mentary  film-maker  and  writer  whose  mother,  Nina  Rajmic,  bom  and  raised  in  Lodz,  survived  the  Warsaw  Ghetto  through  circumstances  as  miraculous  and  poignant  as  those  depicted  in  Roman  Polanski’s  The  Pianist.  In  Nina’s  case,  however,  her  saviour  wasn’t  a  German  officer,  but  her  older  brother,  Rudek.   Choosing  to  remain  with  Nina  and  his  parents  rather  than  flee  to  Russia  with  his  girlfriend,  Rudek  joined  the   Daniel  Burman's  Family  tackles  the  theme  of  paternity.   Jewish  police  in  the  Warsaw  Ghetto,  but  resigned  when  he  was  unable  to  perform  acts  that  were  repugnant  to  him.  Through  luck,  his  entrepreneurial  skills  and  an  understanding  of  how  the  ghetto  operated,  Rudek  kept  his  par  ents  and  sister  alive  until  the  Ghetto  Uprising,  when  Nina,  her  mother  and  Rudek  were  smuggled  to  the  Aryan  side,  the  brother  and  sister  living  among  gentiles  until  the  war’s  end.   Having  returned  to  the  family’s  apartment  in  Lodz  after  liberation,  Nina  went  to  Copenhagen  in  1946  where  she  studied  medicine  and  met  Einhom’s  father,  Jerzy,  a  Holocaust  survivor  from  southern  Poland.  Warned  not  to  return  to  Poland  because  of  the  1946  Kielce  Massacre,  Nina  and  Jerzy  decided  to  emigrate  to  Sweden,  believing  it  would  be  easier  to  gain  residence  there  than  in  Denmark.   But  this  wasn’t  the  case.   “It  was  during  the  Cold  War,”  Einhorn  says  from  her  home  in  Stockholm.  “My  parents  claimed  to  be  Polish  refugees,  but  they  had  returned  to  Poland  twice  -  my  mother  to  visit  Rudek,  and  my  father  to  visit  his  fam  ily,  who  had  survived.   “Most  Holocaust  survivors  went  directly  to  Sweden  from  the  camps.  The  Swedish  authorities  were  suspi  cious.  Why  were  they  going  back  wards  and  forwards  to  Poland,  if  they  were  refugees?  But  in  the  end,  I  can  say  that  both  my  parents  loved  Sweden  and  lived  successful  and  well-integrated  lives.”   Nina’s  Journey,  Einhom’s  film  about  her  mother’s  journey  from  Lodz  and  back  via  the  Warsaw  Ghetto,  won  two  Golden  Bugs  at  this  year’s  Swedish  Film  Awards,  one  for  best  film  and  another  for  best  screenplay.  To  cap  this,  her  book  of  the  same  name,  writ  ten  before  the  film  went  into  produc   tion  and  at  a  time  when  it  seemed  that  it  might  never  be  made,  won  the  2005  Swedish  August  Prize  in  the  non-fiction  category,  for  being  “an  indispensable  piece  of  literary  testimony”.   However,  bringing  Nina’s  story  to  the  attention  of  the  world  wasn’t  straightforward.  Throughout  her  childhood,  Nina  had  often  spoken  to  her  daughter  about  her  wartime  experiences  in  a  carefully  chosen  manner  that  conveyed  no  anxiety.  But  in  the  early  1990s,  Nina  decided  to  tell  the  story  for  posterity,  and  dictated  the  entire  account.   to  be  Jewish,  but  at  the  same  time  they  don’t   make  their  Jewishness*   “I  think  she  hoped  it  would  become  a  book,""  says  Einhom.  “It  was  impor  tant  for  her  to  tell  the  story  because  she  wanted  people  to  know  how  heroic  Rudek  had  been.  He  died  in  1995.  But  nothing  came  of  it  then.  I  was  a  documentary  film-maker,  and  I  had  always  thought  it  was  her  story.”   Nina  was  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer  in  1999,  the  same  year  that  Einhom’s  father  succumbed  to  leukaemia.  On  impulse,  Einhom  recorded  a  four-and-a-half-hour  inter  view  with  her  mother  on  film.  But  it   the  basis  of  everythi   w   Daniel  Burmjjpr   Director,  Familfitaw   took  a  year  and  a  half  before  she  worked  out  how  she  was  going  to  use   the  material.   “I  couldn’t  see  the  film  being  a  pure  documentary,  because  of  all  the  anec  dotes  and  personal  details.  But  I  didn’t  want  to  lose  such  a  great  inter  view.  So  I  started  thinking:  who  says  you  can’t  make  a  feature  film  with  an  authentic  narrator?  Many  feature  films  about  real  events  have  narrators  -  Titanic  does  -  and  there  are  others.  So  why  can’t  I  make  a  feature  film  that  uses  the  authentic  person?”   With  this  approach,  Nina’s  Journey  allows  unique  insight  into  the  Warsaw  Ghetto  because  of  the  authenticity  of  the  narrator’s  own  experience.   Einhom  believes  that  the  relation  ship  between  Poles  and  Jews  is  very  complicated.   “Jewry  and  Poland  have  a  long  his  tory  going  back  to  the  14th  century.  It’s  a  history  that  contains  a  lot  of   antisemitism.  There  was  also  a  lot  of  cross-fertilisation.  But  the  fact  is   there  were  no  Polish  SS  troops...  Now  you  can  argue:  did  the  Poles  help  enough?  But  as  my  mother  says  in  the  film,  if  they  were  caught  hiding  Jews  they  were  killed  immediately.”   LAWOMIR  Grunberg  sees  things  differently.  An  Emmy  Award-win   v—/ning  documentary  film-maker  |  who  graduated  from  the  Polish  Film  !  School  in  Lodz  before  emigrating  to  the  United  States  in  1981,  his  film,  The   Legacy  ofJedwabne,  is  a  feature-length  s  documentary  that  tells  the  story  of  the  pogrom  in  Jedwabne,  Poland,  a  vil  lage  where  Jews  lived  side  by  side  with  Poles  for  nearly  300  years.   Jews  made  up  more  than  half  of  Jedwabne’s  2500  residents  at  the  beginning  of  World  War  n,  and  relations  were  mostly  harmonious  until  July  10,   1941,  when  almost  the  entire  Jewish  popula  tion  was  herded  into  a  bam  where  they  were  burned  to  death  by  their  Polish  neighbours.   In  the  light  of  research  by  Polish  historian  Jan  Gross,  which  points  to  evidence  that  the  massacre  v/as  reportedly  the  work  of  Poles  and  not  Germans,  Grunberg’s  powerful  but  troubling  film  explores  the  impact  of  the  ,  pogrom  on  the  village  today.  It  follows  a   group  of  Jews  from  North  and  South  America  who  travelled  to  Jedwabne  for  the  60th  anniversary  of  the  massacre.   “I  made  The  Legacy  of  Jedwabne  because  I  felt  I  was  the  right  person  to  do  it,”  says  Grunberg,  who  is  currently  in  Dharamsala,  northern  India,  where  he  is  filming  a  docu   mentary.   “My  father  is  Jewish  and  still  lives  in  Poland,”  he  explains.  “He  is  a  historian  and  the  author  of  many  books  about  World  War  II.  He  married  a  Christian  woman,  but  they   divorced  before  I  was  even  bom.”   Grunberg’s  mother  was  17  when  he  was  born,  and  he  was  raised  by  his  maternal  grandparents.  But  he  often  visited  his  father’s  parents,  who  survived  the  war  deep  inside  Russia,  and  his  latest  documentary,  Saved  By  Deportation,  to  be  released  in  December,  fol  lows  the  story  of  Jews  who,  like  his  paternal  grandparents,  survived  in  similar  ways.   The  director  of  more  than  40  documen  taries,  Grunberg  moved  to  America  in  the  1980s.  But  given  the  controversy  today  about  Jedwabne  in  Poland,  would  Grunberg  have  made  The  Legacy  of  Jedwabne  if  he  had  still   lived  there?   Probably  not,  he  says.  In  Poland,  few  peo  ple  knew  of  the  film  he  was  making.  Polish  tel  evision  wasn’t  involved  in  the  production,  and  the  film  was  made  entirely  out  of  his  own  private  funds  -  “an  act  of  love,”  he  explains.  It  wasn’t  until  the  film  screened  in  Warsaw  as  part  of  the  Jewish  Film  Festival  that  it  became  a  huge  success.  The  cinema  was  packed  and  people  were  standing  in  order  to  see  it.   One  of  the  film’s  most  moving  moments   comes  at  the  rededication  of  the  monument  on  the  site  of  the  pogrom,  at  which  Poland’s  then  president  Aleksander  Kwasniewski  pub  licly  apologises  for  the  massacre.   “I  think  the  president  took  a  big  political  risk  to  state  his  position  so  publicly,”  says  Grunberg.  “Even  after  a  report  which  came  from  the  Polish  commission  that  investigated  the  pogrom,  30  per  cent  of  Poles  still  don’t  believe  that  Poles  were  involved  in  the  killing  of  Jews  in  Jedwabne.  And  the  majority  believe  that  if  they  did  do  it,  it  was  because  they  were  forced  to  do  it  by  Germans.   “I  think  that  the  villagers  are  more  repre  sentative.  However,  there  is  a  growing  new  generation  of  Poles,  and  this  gives  much  hope  for  the  future.”   AT  the  other  end  of  the  extreme  -  from   the  old  world  to  the  new  -  comes  Daniel  Burman’s  new  feature,  Family  Law.   Although  touted  as  the  third  part  of  his  tril  ogy,  the  young  Argentinean  director  explains  that  it  was  never  his  intention  to  make  a  tril  ogy,  although  he  understands  why  people   might  see  it  this  way.  While  all  three  films  -  Waiting  for  the  Messiah,  Last  Embrace,  and  now  Family  Law—have  a  hero  called  Ariel,  the  con  necting  link,  Burman  explains,  is  “paternity”.   In  Family  Law,  Ariel  Perelman  is  a  public  defence  lawyer  who  lectures  at  the  university,  while  his  father  is  a  smooth  find  successful  lawyer  who  has  an  empty  room  in  his  comfort  able  office  with  Ariel’s  name  on  the  door.   “Each  of  my  films  talks  about  paternity  in  a  different  way.  In  Family  Law  it  is  about  how  you  become  a  father,  and  how  you  are  a  son,”  says  Burman.  “I  focus  on  how  the  character  of  a  father  is  something  that  grows  and  changes,  and  is  not  always  the  same.   “What  is  biographical  in  Family  Law  is  that  1  have  two  sons  -  a  four  year  old  like  in  the  film,  and  a  boy  who  is  two.  And  I  realise  that  nobody  can  teach  me  how  to  become  a  father.”   While  Ariel  in  all  three  of  Burman’s  films  struggles  with  existential  problems  (what  it  means  to  be  a  human  being,  what  it  means  to  be  a  father),  he  has  no  problems  at  all  with  his  Jewishness,  which  is  treated  with  a  light  touch.  For  Burman,  this  is  a  reflection  of  the  “comfortableness”  of  being  Jewish  in  Argentina.   “In  Argentina,  the  fact  of  being  Jewish  is  absolutely  natural,”  says  Burman.  “You  don’t  need  to  confirm  your  identity  each  day.   “Many  Holocaust  survivors  came  to  Argentina  after  the  war,  and  many  Nazis  came  too.  But  this  is  the  third  generation,  and  peo  ple  are  very  relaxed.”   While  Burman,  Fabien  Bielinski  (Nine  Queens')  and  Gabriel  Lichtmann  (Jews  in  Space,  which  is  screening  at  the  Festival  of  Jewish  Cinema),  are  among  the  better  known  Jewish  film-makers  of  the  new  Argentinean  cin  ema,  there  is,  according  to  Burman,  at  least  10  Jewish  film-makers  working  in  the  local  indus  try  which  each  year  produces  around  70  films.   “It  is  incredible  how  many  Jewish  film-mak  ers  we  have.  They  are  very  proud  to  be  Jewish,  but  at  the  same  time  they  don’t  make  their  Jewishness  the  basis  of  everything.  For  me,  this  is  the  perfect  combination.”   As  for  the  source  of  his  inspiration,  Burman  says  he  is  not  necessarily  inspired  by  other   film-makers  alone.   “For  me,  the  inspiration  for  cinema  doesn’t  come  from  cinema.  It  is  fired  by  something  an  uncle  might  have  told  me,  or  something  I  have  read  in  the  newspaper.  Anything  in  daily  life  comes  to  me  when  I  write,  or  when  I  am  shooting.”   The  2006  Festival  of  Jewish  Cinema  mns  from   November  2-19  at  Greater  Union.

"  2006  WINTER  OLYMPICS   Skaters  lead  Jewish  charge   LIONEL  GAFFEN   SINCE  the  1932  Winter  Olympics  when  Irving  Jaffee  of  the  USA  won  gold  medals  in  the  5000m  and  10,000m  speed-skating  events  at  Lake  Placid,  New  York,  Jews  have  become  increasingly  active  in  winter  sports.   In  more  recent  games,  figure  skat-  ing  has  been  where  Jews  have  made  a  bigger  impact  and  that  will  hold  true   in  Torino  as  well.   Leading  the  pack  is  Russia’s  Irina  Slutskaya,  the  reigning  world  cham-  pion  and  a  silver  medallist  at  the  2002  Winter  Olympics  in  Salt  Lake  City.   Slutskaya  has  had  her  share  of  ups  and  downs  in  a  distinguished  career   that  saw  her  rise  to  no.  1  in  the  world   rankings  in  2002.  She  missed  the  world  championships  in  2003  due  to   her  mother’s  illness  and  suffered  from  vasculitis,  which  caused  her  to  miss  almost  the  entire  2003/2004   season.   Slutskaya,  who  visits  an  ageing  grandmother  in  Netanya  in  the  off-  season,  is  noted  as  the  inventor  of  the  double-Biellmann  spin  with  foot  change,  a  skating  movement  that  requires  tremendous  flexibility.   Hot  on  Slutskaya’s  skates  will  be  Sasha  Cohen,  world  championship  runner-up  two  years  running  and  a  fourth-place  finisher  at  Salt  Lake  City.   A  bridesmaid  at  the  US  champi-  onships  for  the  past  four  years,  she  will  likely  be  the  Americans’  best  chance  of  winning  three  straight  gold  medals  in  the  event’s  history.   Emily  Hughes  managed  a  third-  place  finish  at  the  US  Olympic  trials  in  January,  which  under  normal  cir-  cumstances  would  have  guaranteed  her  a  ticket  to  Torino.  However,  she  was  bumped  down  to  first  alternate  when  Michelle  Kwan,  a  five-time  world  champion  and  bronze  medal-  list  in  2002,  was  deemed  fit  to  com-  pete  by  a  panel  of  judges.  Kwan  this  week  withdrew  from  the  games,  leav-  ing  Hughes  able  to  compete.   Oksana  Baiul,  who  competed  for  Ukraine  and  won  an  Olympic  gold  at  16  in  Lillehammer,  Norway,  in  1994,  was  unaware  of  her  Jewish  roots  until  2003,  when  she  was  reunited  with  her  Jewish  father  and  grandmother.   Along  with  the  figure-skating  individuals,  there  are  a  number  of  successful  ice-dance  duos  where  one   US  Olympic  Ice-dancer  Jamie  Silversteln  with  her  partner  Ryan  O’Meara  at  the   American  championships.  Photo:  Paul  Harvath/US  figure  skating   of  the  partners  has  a  Jewish  background.   Two  of  the  three  US  couples  fea-  ture  a  Jewish  female  partner.  Melissa  Gregory,  whose  mother  is  Jewish,  is  married  to  Denis  Petukhov,  while  Jamie  Silverstein  is  partnered  with  Ryan  O’Meara.  Silverstein  is  the  1999  world  junior  champion  (with  Justin  Pekarek),  and  she  took  a  break  from  skating  from  2002-2005  to  concentrate  on  her  studies.   Adam  Rosen  competed  in  luge  for  Great  Britain,  where  he  finished  18th  overall  behind  Italian  winner  Armin  Zoeggeler.  This  is  the  first  time  since  1992  that  lugers  from   Great  Britain  have  qualified  for  the  Winter  Olympics.   Steve  Mesler  will  be  in  strong  contention  for  a  gold  medal  in  Torino  as  part  of  both  the  two-man  and  four-man  USA1  bobsled  teams.   Mesler  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  top  brakemen  in  the  world.   Mathieu  Schneider,  the  all-time  leading  Jewish  scorer  in  NHL  his-  tory,  is  currently  one  of  the  top-  scoring  defensemen  in  the  NHL  for  the  Detroit  Red  Wings,  and  has  been  selected  to  be  a  part  of  the  US  hockey  team.

"  THE  JEWISH  WEEK  IN   1966  (JUNE  3)   •  SOVIET  Jewry  campaigner  Isi  Leibler's  second  pamphlet,  “Soviet  Jewry  and  the  Australian  Communist  Party”,  is  received  favourably  by  the  Australian  Jewish  com  munity.  The  publication  focuses  on  the  Australian  Communist  Party’s  attitudes  to  Soviet  repression  of  Jews.  An  earlier  volume  by  Leibler,  “Soviet  Jewry  and  human  rights”  also  made  a  big  impact;   •  The  AJN  notes  an  upsurge  of  promo  tional  activity  for  Australian  travel  to  Israel  by  the  Israeli  Consulate  in  Sydney  and  by  the  Zionist  Federation  of  Australia’s  Mel  bourne  office.  Calls  for  more  visitors  to  Israel  appear  to  have  been  taken  up  by  community  organisations  and  by  Jewish  run  businesses;   •  Israeli  shipping  company  Zim  seeks  to  become  a  member  of  the  Australian  Shipping  Conference  so  that  it  can  obtain  rights  to  pick  up  passengers  in  Australian  ports  and  compete  for  a  share  of  the  carrying  trade.  Zim’s  press  and  public  relations  director,  Ruth  Aliav,  announces  the  initiative  during  her  visit  to  Australia;   •  South  African  journalist  Levi  Shalit,  edi  tor  of  a  Johannesburg-based  Jewish  community  newspaper,  arrives  in  Aus  tralia.

"  Jewish  new   State-sponsored  travesty   THERE  is  something  rather  farcical  about  the  collection  of  misfits,   dilettantes,  dabblers  and  weirdo  anti-Zionist  rabbis  that  gathered  in  Tehran  this  week  to  collectively  deny  the  Holocaust.  If  the  “Review  of  the  Holocaust:  global  vision”  conference  wasn’t  so  odious,  it  could  arguably  be  dismissed  as  a  preposterous  assembly  of  lunatics  let  loose  from  the  insane  asylum.   But  what  turns  this  contemptible  congress  into  a  clear  and  present  danger  is  the  fact  that  it  was  convened  by  a  sovereign  state,  a  fully-fledged  member  of  the  United  Nations,  a  country  that  maintains  normal  diplomatic  relations  with  most  countries  of  the  world,  including,  regrettably,  Australia.   This  is  state-sponsored  Holocaust  denial,  a  dose  cousin  of  state-sponsored   terrorism,  for  which  Iran  is  also  renowned.   Though  media  reports  in  the  West  are  laced  with  contempt  for  the  confer  ence,  the  wretched  world  of  Holocaust  deniers  -  including  Australia’s  own  “historian”  Dr  Frederick  Toben  and  socialite  Michele  Renouf  -  has  been  given  an  international  podium  like  never  before.   Their  despicable  and  distorted  message  is  being  broadcast  around  the  world.  And  while  most  consumers  of  news  in  western  countries  can  safely  be  assumed  to  be  immune  from  the  abominable  bile  from  Tehran,  hundreds  of  millions  of  impressionable  others  -  in  Asia,  Africa  and  the  Muslim  world  -  may  indeed  come  to  the  conclusion  that  denial  of  the  greatest  crime  in  mod  em  history  is  just  another  “legitimate”  point  of  view.   By  adopting  Holocaust  denial  as  his  favoured  mantra,  Iranian  President  Mahmoud  Ahmadinejad  is  aiming  to  delegitimise  the  very  existence  of  Israel.  According  to  his  twisted  logic,  if  there  was  no  Holocaust,  there  should  be  no  Israel.  And  even  if  there  was  a  Holocaust  -  albeit  much  less  significant  that  that  portrayed  “by  the  Jews”  —  then  it  is  not  the  Palestinians  “who  should  pay  the  price”,  but  rather  Europeans,  who  caused  the  carnage  in  the  first  place.   It  is  hard  to  underestimate  the  degree  of  insult  and  injury  that  this  foul  forum  may  be  causing  to  Jews  everywhere,  especially  to  remaining  Holocaust  survivors,  of  which  Australia  has  its  fair  share.  To  have  such  a  conference  ques  tion  their  own  suffering  and  the  wholesale  slaughter  of  their  -  and  our  -  mothers  and  fathers,  sons  and  daughters,  grandmothers  and  grandfathers,  is  an  affront  of  inhuman  proportions.   The  same  should  be  true  for  the  rest  of  the  civilised  world  —  most  of  which   has  indeed  condemned  the  conference  in  no  uncertain  terms  -  though  it  has  yet  to  draw  the  proper  conclusions.   For  if  there  is  one  positive  aspect  of  this  loathsome  congregation,  it  is  to  drive  home  to  any  remaining  sceptic  that  Ahmadinejad’s  Iran  is  indeed  dan  gerous  and  deranged,  as  US  Senator  John  McCain  rightly  said  this  week.  When  armed  with  a  nuclear  bomb,  such  a  disturbed  government  will  pose  no  less  a  threat  to  world  stability  and  peace  than  did  the  Nazi  regime  of  World  War  II.   In  this  context,  one  can  only  express  regret  and  dismay  that  a  usually  rational  and  right-thinking  government  -  such  as  our  own  in  Canberra  -  con  tinues  to  talk  and  trade  with  Iran,  rather  than  banishing  it  to  the  most  remote  economic  and  diplomatic  isolation  possible,  as  it  so  justly  deserves.

"  LESS  JEWISH?   JULIE  Szego  asks  if  choosing  not  to  circumcise  makes  you  any  less  Jewish.   That  makes  about  as  much  sense  as   asking  whether  refusing  to  sign  your  ketubah  after  the  chuppah  makes  you  any  less  married.   A  Jew  is  a  Jew  is  a  Jew.

Invalidating  the  covenant  of  circumcision,  whether  simply  refusing  to  honour  it  or  trying  to  substitute  other  practices,  causes  “the  soul  [to]  be  cut  off  from  its  peo  ple”  (Bereshit,  17,9-14).

"  JEWISH  FUNDAMENTALISM   THE  theological  nonsense  attributed  to  former  Sephardic  chief  Rabbi  Mordechai  Eliyahu  (AJN  27/4)  pro  vides  readers  a  revealing  and  unflat  tering  look  at  Jewish  fundamentalist  thought.  The  rabbi’s  assertion  that  the  death  of  the  six  million  could  be  attributed  to  the  Reform  movement  in  Germany  relieves  the  Nazis  of  respon  sibility  for  die  Holocaust  and  casts  the  Almighty  in  the  role  of  His  people’s  prosecutor  and  executioner.

Responding  to  the  verse  from  Parshat  Kedoshim  (Leviticus  19:18),  “You  must  love  your  neighbour  as  you  love  yourself’,  he  spoke  from  the  depths  of  his  soul:  “All  of  you  are  bound  to  me.  In  the  aspiration  of  all  of  you,  my  life  has  significance.  Without  you,  I  have  nothing.  I  need  to  connect  with  all  of  your  souls.  I  must  love  you  with  a   boundless  love.”   How  and  why  the  Shoah  came   about  may  forever  elude  explanation.  Yet  surely,  one  of  its  enduring  lessons  is  the  interrelatedness  of  all  Jews.  Extreme  ideological  rigidness  that  excoriates  and  delegitimises  other  Jews  serves  only  to  divide  and  demoralise  our  people  and  should  be  universally  rebuked.  As  always,  the  derech  tova  (the  good,  desirable  path)  for  Jews  is  one  that  leads  to  enhanced  coopera  tion,  indusiveness,  mutual  respect  and   love.

"  JEWISH  HEROINES   IN  Torah  Topic  (AJN  12/1),  Rabbi  Ehud  Bandel  concludes  his  article  as  follows:  “Are  we  going  to  find  the  right-  eous  woman  of  this  generation  who  will  bring  us  redemption  and  peace?”   My  answer  is  yes!  I  take  the  liberty  to  name  only  few  who  were  righteous  in  my  lifetime:   1.  Chajka  Grossman,  member  of  Knesset.  Chajka  led  the  Bialistok  uprising  against  the  Nazis.   2.  Hanna  Senesh  and  Haviva   Reich.  Hanna  was  parachuted  into  Hungary  and  Haviva  into  Slovakia  during  World  War  II  to  fight  the   Nazis.  Both  fell  in  battle.   3.  Esther  Weisblum,  Regina  Sapirstein,  Ella  Gertener,  Rosa  Robota  -  organised  the  blowing  up  of  a  cre-  matorium  in  Auschwitz-Birkenau,  saving  almost  500,000  Jews  from  gassing.  The  four  heroines  were  dis-  covered  by  the  SS  and  hanged  on  January  6,1945.   There  have  never  been  such  hero-   ines  in  Jewish  history  and  let’s  hope  that  in  the  centuries  ahead  there  will  never  be  a  need  for  our  people  to  have  such  women  as  listed  above.

I  have  never  voted  Labor  in  my  life  but  this  year  I  am  going  to  vote  for  Newhouse.

No  other  politician  could  under  stand  our  community  as  well  as  George,  who  was  brought  up  with  the  stories  of  how  his  family  fled  pogroms  in  Russian  and  who  learned  first  hand  the  meaning  of  the  tattoos   on  the  arms  of  his  “aunties”.   I  respect  Malcolm  Turnbull’s  efforts  to  appear  to  be  our  friend.  I  have  seen  him  when  he  puts  on  a  yar  mulke  and  speaks  a  “bissle”  Yiddish,  but  that  will  never  give  him  the  insight  into  the  Jewish  soul  that  comes  from  living  as  a  Jew  and  seeing  the  example  of  his  father  and  grandfather.

One  of  her  grandsons,  Peter  Israel  ski,  47,  told  the  AJN:  “My  sister  and  I  spent  the  first  20-odd  years  living  with  her,  so  it  was  like  having  a  second  mother.

"  To  be  Jewish,  family  matters   RABBI  SHLOMO  RISKIN  provides  a  different  perspective  on  the  Omer  period.   JUDAISM  teaches  that  every   Israelite  is  a  co-signer  for  his/her  fellow  Jew.  Aside  from  the  State  of  Israel  -  where  the  Jewish  popula  tion  has  grown  from  600,000  in  1948  •  to  5.5  million  today  -  Jews  in  the  rest  of  the  world  suffer  from  internal  haemorrhaging,  with  half  of  the  six  million  identifying  American  Jews  in  1940  moving  toward  extinction  by  the  end  of  the  21st  century.   So  how  do  we  “instruct”  our  errant  Jewish  siblings  to  remain  within  -  or  return  to  -  Jewish  peoplehood?   I  believe  that  the  very  nature  of  the  Hebrew  calendar  points  to  a  solution.  We  recently  celebrated  Pesach,  and  are  currently  “counting”  each  day  toward  the  festival  of  Shavuot.  The  Hebrew  term  for  the  counting  is  sefira,  a  word  whose  root  is  sappir  (samech,  peh,  resh),  the  dazzling  blue-white  sapphire  diamond,  its  ethereal  hues  the  colours  of  the  heavens.   Immediately  following  the  electri  fying  revelation  at  Sinai,  the  Bible  records:  “Moses  and  Aaron,  Nadab  and  Abihu,  and  the  70  elders  of  Israel  then  went  up.  And  they  saw  the  God  of  Israel,  beneath  whose  ‘feet’  was  some  thing  akin  to  the  creation  of  a  sapphire  stone,  like  the  essence  of  the  heavens  as  to  its  purity.”  (Shemot  24:9,10).   From  this  perspective,  the  days  of  our  counting  must  be  seen  as  a  period   of  spiritual  growth.  It  begins  with  Pesach,  the  first  real  encounter  that  God  has  with  His  nation.  And  the  Hebrew  sefira  (count,  sapphire)  is  also  based  on  the  noun  sippur,  a  tale,  a  re  counting  that’s  the  very  essence  of  the  seder  experience:  “And  you  shall  tell  (haggadah,  telling  a  story)  your  child  on  that  day  saying  ...”  (Shemot  13:8);  “And  Moses  recounted  to  (vayesaper)   his  father-in-law  all  that  the  Lord  had  done”  (Shemot  18:8);  “It  is  a  positive   commandment  of  the  Bible  to  recount  (lesaper)  the  miracles  and  wonders  done  for  our  forefathers  in  Egypt”  (Mishneh  Torah,  Laws  of  Chametz  and  Matza  7,1).   We  must  remember  that  the   Israelites  came  into  Egypt  as  a  family,  the  70  descendants  of  our  grandfather  Jacob/Israel.  Pesach  is  our  familial  fes  tival,  at  the  very  beginning  of  our  cal  endar,  during  the  early  steps  toward  our  sefira  march,  celebrated  even  before  we  received  the  Torah  and  before  we  entered  the  Promised  Land.   The  Pesach  sacrifice  (Exodus  12)  rep  resents  the  celebration  of  our  being  part  of  a  special  family  even  before  we  become  a  religion  at  Sinai.   And  in  order  to  feel  truly  free,  every  person  must  feel  that  he  or  she  counts  (sefira);  but  that  is  how  it  is  in  families,  where  each  member  is  called  by  his/her  personal  name  and  is  known   This  18th  century  German  Omer  calendar  depicts  each  date  In  a  circle  on  the   branches  of  a  tree.  Photo:  Sotheby’s   by  his/her  unique  traits.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  our  Pesach  sacrifice  must  be  subdivided  into  smaller  -  and  more  manageable  -  units,  “a  lamb  for  each  household”  or  several  households   together.  How  do  we  engage  our  Jews  so  they  do  not  fall  away?  We  must  embrace  them  as  part  of  our  family.  For  some,  it  may  be  the  first  step   toward  their  march  to  Torah  and  the  Land  of  Israel  on  Shavuot;  for  others,  it  might  be  all  they  are  interested  in.  And  that  too  must  be  considered  good  enough,  Dayenu!  After  all,  the  very  first   covenant  God  made  with  Abraham  was  the  covenant  of  family  and  nation.

SEA  changes  are  very  much  in  fashion  for  Australian  Jews,  with  the  national  census  reporting  that  the  areas  with  the  fastest  growing  Jewish  populations  are  locales,  more  commonly  associated  with  holidays.   Seaside  regions  like  Byron  Bay  and  Coffs  Harbour  in  New  South  Wales  and  the  Sunshine  Coast  in  Queensland  are  experiencing  an  influx  of  Jewish  people,  as  families  search  for  cheaper  property,  a  more  relaxing  way  of  life  and  new  job  opportunities.

"  Can  a  Jew-saving  Nazi  be  redeemed  r   LEXI  LANDSMAN   IT  was  an  obsession  that  turned  a  medical   doctor  into  an  investigative  writer  seeking  to  uncover  the  secrets  of  an  SS  officer.   It  took  South  African-born  Harold  Serebro  10  years  to  write  the  story  of  SS  Colonel  Kurt  Andreas  Becher  and  a  further  two  years  to  check  the  facts.  He  filled  27  boxes  with  files,  conducted  over  130  interviews  and  travelled  to  26  countries.   The  result  is  the  meticulously-researched  Beyond  Redemption,  which  Serebro  wrote  with  Jacques  Sellschop.  It  was  launched  in  Sydney  last  Sunday  at  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  and  will  be  launched  in  Melbourne  today  (Thursday).   The  story  seeks  to  uncover  the  truth  behind  Becher,  a  confidante  of  Himmler  who  worked  with  Eichmann  and  was  involved  in  the  murder  of  thousands  of  men,  women  and  children  in  the  Pripet  Marshes.   But  towards  the  end  of  the  Holocaust,  Becher  negotiated  the  rescue  of  1684  Jews  in  exchange  for  their  wealth  by  putting  them  on  a  train  bound  for  Switzerland,  which  begs  the  question:  Can  a  Nazi  be  redeemed  for  killing  Jews  after  saving  some?   “It’s  a  saga  like  no  other  in  history,""  Serebro  says.  “Here  were  the  Jews  in  Hungary  that  were  trapped  -  it  was  like  a  ghetto  with  invisible  walls.  He  sped  up  that  process  in  the  beginning  but,  when  it  suited  him,  he  slowed  it  down.”   Serebro  has  studied  Nazi  foreign  policy  and  lectured  widely  on  the  Holocaust  for  more  than  30  years,  which  is  why  the  story  resonated  with  him  on  so  many  levels.   Harold  Serebro  (middle)  presents  bis  book,  Beyond  Redemption,  to  former  UK  prime  minister  Tony  Blair  (left).  Also  pictured  is  Jacques  Seilschop.   “This  story  encompasses  everything  that’s  in  Shakespeare  -  the  dilemmas  of  good  and  evil,  the  lessons  of  excess  and  modera  tion,  of  retribution  and  redemption.”   The  story  came  to  Serebro  by  chance.  A  friend  told  him  that  Becher  had  gone  to  a  Shabbat  dinner  with  the  owner  of  a  company  with  whom  he  regularly  traded  grain.   Within  days,  Serebro  had  become  con  sumed  with  the  story  -  he  spoke  to  the  fam  ily,  got  in  contact  with  intelligence  agencies  and  discovered  the  story  had  truth.   “I  [tried  to  imagine]  a  colonel  of  the  SS  -  a  member  of  Hitler’s  death  squad  -  wearing  a  yarmulka  when  once  it  was  an  SS  helmet,  [responding]  to  the  kiddish  in  a  Jewish  home  on  a  Friday  night.”   And  so,  he  set  out  on  a  relentless  search  for  justice  in  an  attempt  to  expose  the  truth   behind  the  man  that  had  been  hailed  as  a  sav   iour  by  some,  and  a  villain  by  others.   “The  book  explores  whether  a  person’s  conscience  can  atrophy.  I  couldn’t  believe  that  a  guy  that  was  so  evil,  who  was  an  SS  offi  cer,  could  suddenly  switch  a  thermostat  in  his  mind  and  save  Jews  to  save  his  own  skin.”   Serebro  spent  countless  hours  in  library  archives,  talking  to  reputable  historians,  interviewing  victims,  perpetrators  and  even  those  that  had  been  bystanders.   And  in  his  attempt  to  leave  no  room  for  disbelievers,  Serebro  said  he  decided  two  things  when  he  set  about  to  write  the  book  -  to  have  it  well  referenced  and  to  check  every  statement  made  in  an  interview  with  multiple  sources  so  it  would  become  worthy  of  fact.   His  goal  was  to  present  the  evidence  to  readers  and  let  them  decide  whether  Becher  redeemed  himself  for  saving  Jews.   At  the  end  of  the  war,  Becher  slipped  through  the  postwar  Nuremberg  Trials  to  emerge  as  a  wealthy  and  prominent  grain  trader  who  spent  the  rest  of  his  life  until  he  died  in  1995  in  business  trades,  dealing  with  many  Jews  on  a  global  scale.   Next  week,  Serebro  will  give  a  lecture  on  Beyond  Redemption  at  Shalom  College,  and  will  address  the  question:  “Did  his  humani  tarian  gestures  sanitise  his  soul  or  did  his  motives  of  commercial  gain  condemn  him  to  eternal  guilt?”  Serebro’s  first  book  Devil  and  his  Servant  was  released  in  1987.   The  lecture  will  take  place  on  November  15  at  Shalom   College.  For  further  information  call  (02)  9663  0655   or  email  to  rikkl@shalom.edu.au. ",2007-11-09
"  LOST  HONOUR  OF  JEWISH  WIVES   AFTER  living  in  Australia  all  my  life  I  cannot  believe  the  schism  and  polari-  sation  that  is  apparent  here  in  Sydney  between  the  wealthy  well-to-do  Jews  and  the  struggling  Jewish  community  -  which  I  strongly  believe  is  the  fault  of  the  recent  immigration  to  our  shores  from  the  Jewish  community  from  overseas  (who  share  with  Aus-  tralia  the  Indian  Ocean),  who  have  a  reputation  for  the  high  life  that  we  Aussies  are  trying  to  mistakenly  emu-  late  and  that  was  never  part  of  our  close-knit  Jewish  community.   You  have  here  one  great  example  of  a  Jewish  private  school,  Moriah  Secondary  College,  which  is  so  expen-  sive  and  dominated  by  the  kids  of  these  recent  immigrants  that  you   have  to  be  a  member  of  a  super-rich  family  to  attend.   Also  our  community  is  now  awash  with  ladies  who  have  nothing  better  to  do  than  shop  all  day,  while  their  poor  husbands  slog  all  day  to  keep  up  with  the  community’s  expectations.  These  ladies  have  cleaners  and  nan-  nies,  cooks  and  gardeners  at  their  dis-  posal.  Haven’t  they  ever  heard  of  the  Yiddish  word,  balebusta?  They  think  they  are  characters  on  the  80s  hit   show  Dallas'.   C’mon,  what  has  become  of  the  good  old-fashioned  Jewish  wife?  Has  the  allure  of  money  turned  all  of  them  into  high-fashion  house  managers  who  dutifully  dish  out  orders  to  their  servants,  while  they  themselves  are  distanced  from  the  everyday  caring  for  their  kids  and  their  Jewish  home?   The  Jewish  wife  once  had  a  reputa-  tion  of  being  the  absolute  boss  of  her  domain.  Even  in  Europe,  hundreds  of  years  ago,  when  other  non-Jewish  wives  were  under  the  thumb  of  their   cruel  husbands,  who  routinely  beat  and  verbally  abused  them,  the  Jewish  wife  was  treated  with  respect  and  honour  by  her  Jewish  husband.  Maybe  there  was  a  good  reason  for  that;  maybe,  unlike  the  modern  Jew-  ish  wife  of  today,  the  Jewish  wife  of  old  earned  her  respect  for  taking  care  of  the  family  by  herself  -  rather  than  delegating  that  job  to  total  strangers.

"  A  non-Jewish  view  of  Jewish  support  for  Israel   VIEWPOINT   PETER  FARIS   A  non-Jewish  champion  of  Israel  takes  a  long  and   sometimes  perplexed  look  at  Jewish  attitudes  towards  the  Jewish  State.   Some  Jewish   “comrades""  have   embraced  a  position   that  supports  islamism.   WHEN  the  editor  invited   me  to  write  a  piece  on  Australian  Jews,  I  thought  it  would  be  easy.   Not  so.  On  the  other  hand,  I  imagine  it  would  be  equally  difficult  for  a  Jew  to  write  of  his  experiences  with  other  Australians.  I  believe  that  my  invita  tion  came  about  because  of  my  media  profile  as  an  outspoken,  right-wing  lawyer  who  has  given  strong  public  support  to  Israel.   I  think  a  little  more  of  my  back  ground  is  needed  to  put  my  com  ments  in  proper  perspective.  I  have  lived  in  Melbourne  all  my  life  and  I  have  a  fairly  typical  Anglo-Celtic  her  itage.  I  was  not  conscious  of  meeting  a  Jew  until  Year  12,  when  I  first  attended  Melbourne  High  School,  which  attracted  a  large  number  of  Jewish  students.  I  had  never  before  encountered  another  ethnic  or  cul   tural  group  (this  was  1957)  and  I  was  shocked  at  the  level  of  group  cohesion  -  these  students  were  very  bright,  well  organised  and  operated  in  a  closed  shop  as  far  as  study  was  concerned.   I  went  on  to  complete  a  law  degree  at  Melbourne  University  and  observed  the  same  thing.  I  had  very  little  meaningful  contact  with  the  large  Jewish  population  among  the  law  students.  Accordingly,  while  I  spent  four  years  debating  God  and  the  meaning  of  life,  I  had  little  intel  lectual  contact  with  Jews.  In  retro   spect,  the  discussions  I  would  have   liked  to  have  never  occurred.   Things  changed  when  I  began  to  practise  law.  There  were  many  Jews  in  the  legal  profession  and  I  began  to  have  constant  contact  with  them.  We  met  socially  and  I  formed  a  number  of  good  friendships.  I  did  my  clerk   ship  training  with  a  Jew  and  we  became  firm  friends  -  tragically,  in  later  years  he  went  to  jail  for  swin  dling  clients.   Now  I  can  look  back  on  over  40   years  of  friendship  and  conflict  with  Melbourne  Jews,  mainly  in  the  legal  profession.   WHAT,  then,  do  I  think  of  Jews,   based  upon  this  experience?  Working  in  the  difficult  and  demanding  area  of  criminal  law,  I  soon  developed  the  skill  of  identi  fying  how  smart  my  opponent  was.  Rightly  or  wrongly,  my  experience  has  been  that  Jews  are  far  brighter  than  the  average  Aussie.  There  is  something  about  their  heritage  and  tight  education  that  assists  these  gifts.  I  consider  myself  as  having  a  capable  intelligence  but  I  have  met  many  Jews   who  were  far  cleverer  than  me.  In   mixing  socially  with  Jewish  friends,  I   also  came  to  realise  that  these  were  very  cultured  people.   But  there  is  also  a  negative  side.  My  observation  has  been  that  Jews  are  badly  split.  On  the  one  side  are  reli  gious  or  observant  Jews,  ranging  from  ultra-Orthodox  to  mildly  compliant.  These  people  generally  seem  to  be  supporters  of  Israel.  On  the  other  side  are  some  truly  secular  Jews,  a  large  number  of  whom  are  of  the  left  (and  the  hard  left  at  that).  They  seem  to  hate  Israel.  They  seem  to  hate  their  own  Jewishness.   The  Jews  and  the  left  have  always  mixed  closely:  Karl  Marx  and  Leon  Trotsky  are  good  examples.  In  Mel  bourne,  in  the  days  when  commu  nism  was  alive  and  fashionable,  many  communist  leaders  and  left-wing  intellectuals  were  Jews.  Because  of   these  political  beliefs,  left-wing  Jews  were  always  at  the  forefront  of  active   social  work.   But  since  the  collapse  of  commu  nism  and  the  rise  of  Islamism,  things  have  changed  -  for  the  worse.  Some  Jewish  “comrades”  have  embraced  a  position  that  supports  Islamism.  As  best  I  can  understand  it,  this  is  based  upon  a  belief  that  “my  enemy’s  enemy  is  my  friend”.  Radical  Islamicists  hate  America  as  do  ex-communists.  They  both  hope  for  the  collapse  of  capi  talism,  which  will  then  permit  one  or  the  other  of  them  to  take  over.   It  is  disturbing  to  see  Jewish  lawyers  acting  for  alleged  Muslim  ter  rorists.  I  accept  that  this  arises  out  of  long  history  of  radical  Jewish  lawyers  honourably  acting  for  unpopular  clients,  but  it  is  disturbing  nonethe   less.  It  is  equally  disturbing  that  left  wing  Jews,  purporting  to  speak  on  behalf  of  all  Australian  Jews  (and  all  Australians  for  that  matter)  con  stantly  either  attack  Israel  or  refuse  to  support  it.   Australians  correctly  see  Israel  as  an  imperilled  democracy  in  the  midst   of  hostile  Islamic  nations.  Australia  itself  borders  the  biggest  Islamic  nation  in  the  world.  Australians  like  me  think  “if  it  is  Israel  today,  it  will  be   Australia  tomorrow”.  I  cannot  com   prehend  how  any  Jew  could  not  give  unqualified  support  to  the  existence  of  Israel.  Obviously  Israel  makes  mis  takes,  as  do  all  democracies.  But  it  must  survive.  And  to  survive,  it  must  be  supported.   Peter  Faris  is  a  Melbourne  QC  and   broadcaster. ",2007-07-13

"  Missionaries  dump  Jewish  references   LEXI  LANDSMAN   A  MISSIONARY  church  has  removed  references  on  its  website  to   proselytising  activities  at  an  eastern  suburbs  primary  school.   The  action  came  after  the  NSW   Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  slammed  the  Jerusalem  Baptist  Church  (JBC),   which  holds  a  series  of  events  at  Bellevue  Hill  Public  School  through  out  the  year,  for  displaying  signage  and  having  a  “calculated  presence”  at  the  school,  which  comprises  at  least  50  per  cent  Jewish  students.   Previously,  the  doctrine  on  JBC’s  website  said  it  specifically  “out  reaches  the  Jewish  people  and  tries  to  win  them  to  Christ”.  The  modified   doctrine  has  no  references  to  Judaism.   But  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  said  even  though  JBC  had  removed  the  con  tent,  it  “doesn’t  alter  the  nature  of  their  evangelising  activities”.   Alhadeff  said  JBC’s  Reverend  Kyle  Hutton  had  declined  a  request  to   meet  with  him.   “I  wanted  him  to  understand  why  it  is  offensive  to  Jewish  people  when  a  church  seeks  to  evangelise  them,”   Alhadeff  said.  “He  declined  to  meet...   But  he  did  repeat  his  chinch’s  credo  that  ‘to  refuse  to  give  the  gospel  to  Jews  is  akin  to  racism’.  That  statement  right  there  underscores  the  need  for  such  a  meeting.”   Reverend  Sutton  denied  engaging  in  proselytising  activities,  but  said  he  “would  not  refrain  from  talking  to  Jewish  people”.   “We  are  not  trying  to  trick  any  one.  The  premises  chosen  just  hap  pens  to  be  in  the  heart  of  the  Jewish  community,”  he  said.   The  NSW  Department  of  Educa  tion  and  Training  has  said  no  prose  lytising  activities  are  to  take  place  on  school  grounds  and  that  the  church  has  permission  to  erect  a  banner  at  the  school  during  services  but  not  during  school  hours.

Responding  to  a  question  on  whether  he  would  hold  dialogue  with  Tehran  and  Damascus  on  CBS’  60  Minutes  program,  Obama  replied,  “Yes.

"  Jewish-born  cardinal  dies  in  Paris   BEN  HARRIS   NEW  YORK  -  As  Cardinal  Jean  Marie  Lustiger  lay  dying  last  week  in  a  Paris  hospice,  he  reached  out  to  long  time  friend  Rabbi  Israel  Singer.   The  Jewish-bom  Catholic  official,  who  served  for  decades  as  a  conduit  between  the  Vatican  and  the  Jewish  community,  called  Rabbi  Singer,  a  for  mer  senior  official  of  the  World  Jewish  Congress  and  a  major  player  in  the  effort  to  build  Catholic-Jewish  ties.   Rabbi  Singer  flew  to  Paris  and  the   two  met  several  times  before  Cardinal   Lustiger  succumbed  to  cancer  on  Sunday.  He  was  80.   Bom  Aaron  Lustiger  in  Paris  in  1926,  he  was  the  first  child  of  secular  Polish-Jewish  emigres.  In  1940,  he  was  sent  with  his  sister  to  live  with  a  Catholic  woman  following  the  Ger  man  occupation  of  France.   In  August  of  that  year,  at  age  13,  he  was  baptised,  adding  Jean-Marie  to   his  name.   Cardinal  Lustiger  was  a  central  fig  ure  in  Catholic-Jewish  reconciliation  efforts  that  characterised  the  tenure  of   Pope  John  Paul  II,  with  whom  he  was   dose.   He  served  as  John  Paul’s  represen  tative  at  the  commemoration  cere   monies  marking  the  60th  anniversary   of  the  liberation  of  Auschwitz  in  2005.   As  archbishop  of  Paris,  Cardinal  Lustiger  served  as  a  diplomatic  back  channel,  relaying  to  the  Vatican  Jew  ish  concerns  regarding  Catholic  antisemitism  and  the  building  of  a  convent  at  the  Auschwitz  death  camp.   The  latter  issue  had  a  special  reso  nance  for  Cardinal  Lustiger  because  his  mother,  Gisele,  perished  there.   “He  understood  the  feelings  that  a  Jew  has  about  sensitive  and  important  issues,”  said  Rabbi  Singer.  “You  didn’t   have  to  convince  him.  You  didn’t  have  to  convert  him.  He  knew  what  it  felt  to  be  a  Jew  in  a  non-Jewish  environment  because,  in  this  respect,  many  aristo  cratic  Catholics  probably  viewed  him  as  a  Jew.”   A  long-time  proponent  of  inter  religious  reconciliation,  Cardinal  Lustiger  was  nevertheless  seen  as  a  troubling  figure  by  the  small  cohort  of  Jewish  leaders  who  regularly  engaged  their  Catholic  counterparts  in  dialogue.   Though  widely  admired  for  his  warmth  and  friendliness,  even  those  close  to  him  acknowledged  their  dis  comfort  sitting  across  from  a  man  who  had  willingly  converted  to  Catholicism  and  yet  continued  to  speak  of  himself  as  a  Jew.   “I  was  born  Jewish,  and  so  I   Cardinal  Jean-Marie  Lustlger  speaks  at  Tel  Aviv  University  during  a  visit  in  1995.

In  an  interview  soon  after  being  named  archbishop  by  Pope  John  Paul  II,  Cardinal  Lustiger  said:  “For  me  this  nomination  was  as  if,  all  of  a  sudden,  the  crucifix  began  to  wear  a  yellow  star”   In  the  1970s  he  was  reported  to  have  considered  leaving  France  for  Israel,  but  he  remained  and  quickly   rose  up  the  Church  ranks.  He  became  bishop  of  Orleans  in  1979  and  arch  bishop  of  Paris  in  1981.  Two  years  later,  John  Paul  made  him  a  cardinal.  He  retired  in  2005.   During  a  1995  visit  to  Israel  coin  ciding  with  Holocaust  Remembrance  Day,  Cardinal  Lustiger  was  vilified  by  Chief  Rabbi  Yisrael  Meir  Lau,  who  accused  him  of  betraying  his  people   at  their  darkest  hour.

That  fact  is  no  coincidence,  said  Jew-  ish  political  activists:  Jews  vote  over  whelmingly  Democrat  (87  per  cent  did  so  in  November  2006,  according  to  exit  polls).   “The  Jewish  population  tends  to  be  predominantly  Democrat,”  said   Richard  Foltin,  legislative  director  of  the  American  Jewish  Committee.  “If  you  have  a  greater  number  of  Democrats  being  elected,  you’re  going  to  have  a  greater  number  of  Jews  in  office.”   Among  the  Jews  in  Congress,  only  two  senators  (Arlen  Specter  of  Penn-  sylvania  and  Norm  Coleman  of  Min-  nesota)  and  one  representative  (Eric  Cantor  of  Virginia)  are  Republicans.  There  are  also  two  Jewish  independ-  ent  senators  (Bernie  Sanders  of  Ver-  mont  and  Joe  Lieberman  of  Connecticut),  but  both  of  them  have  indicated  they  will  caucus  with  the   Democrats.   That  translates  into  better  com-  mittee  appointments,  Foltin  contin-  ued.  The  110th  Congress  is  not  only  distinguished  by  the  number  of  Jews  holding  office,  but  also  by  how  many  key  leadership  positions  they  hold,  particularly  on  committees  impor-   tant  for  Israel.  For  example,  Tom  Lantos  (pictured)  of  Califor-  nia,  a  Holocaust  sur-  vivor,  became  the  House  International   Relations  Committee  chairman  this  week.   Independent  Senator  Joe  Lieberman,  part  of  the  strong  Jewish  contingent  in  the  new  Congress,  meets  Ethiopian  Immigrants  on  a  visit  to  Israel  last  week.   Photo:  Isranet     Doug  Bloomfield,  a  former  leg-  islative  director  of  the  American  Israel  Public  Affairs  Committee,  also  pointed  to  the  significance  of  senior-  ity  in  leadership  appointments.  As  Jews  have  become  more  comfortable  in  identifying  their  religion  and  run-  ning  for  public  office,  they  increas-  ingly  find  themselves  in  more  prominent  positions  by  virtue  of   time.   “This  is  a  generation  of  Jewish   members  who  are  not  sensitive  about   being  Jewish,  he  said.  This  new  gen-  eration  is  much  more  assertive.   They’ve  also  been  here  longer  and  have  more  authority.”   “It’s  impressive,”  said  William  Daroff,  director  of  the  United  Jew-  ish  Communities’  Washington  office.  “To  have  a  minyan  in  the  Senate  and  three  minyanim  in  the   House  -  it  is  a  real  testament  to  the   political  strength  of  the  Jewish  com-  munity.”   JERUSALEM  POST ",2007-01-12
"  Christians  court  Jewish  votes   YON  I  BASHAN   THE  far-right-wing  Christian  Democratic  Party  (CDP),  headed  by  controversial  pastor  Reverend  Fred  Nile,  has  begun  courting  votes  from  Sydney’s  Jewish  community  to  glean  support  for  its  Upper  House  candi  dates  at  this  Saturday’s  election.   The  CDP  has  put  up  candidates  in  electorates  with  high  Jewish  popu  lations,  including  St  Ives  in  Sydney’s   north  and  Randwiclc  in  the  east.   Reverend  Nile  told  the  AJN  this  week  that  he  is  a  long-time  friend  of  the  Jewish  community  and  Israel,  and  has  visited  the  country  on  sev  eral  occasions  -  once  as  a  special  guest  of  the  Israeli  government   The  unlikely  Jewish  ally,  who  has   donated  more  than  100  trees  to  the   Jewish  National  Fund,  is  backing  some  key  issues  concerning  the  Jew  ish  community  this  election.   Reverend  Nile  said  the  govern  ment  should  be  providing  more  funding  to  protect  the  states  syna  gogues.  “Apparently  the  police  are  providing  free  protection  for  mosques,”  he  told  the  AJN.   “The  Jewish  community  hire  their   own  security  guards,  which  [costs]  around  $1  million  [annually].  I  said  in  parliament  that  50  per  cent  should  be  met  by  the  State  Government”   The  CDP  leader  also  wants  fur   ther  investigation  of  Sheikh  Feiz  Muhammad,  who  was  revealed  to  be  selling  antisemitic  DVDs  from  his   Global  Islamic  Youth  Centre  book   shop  in  Sydney’s  south-west   The  AJN  uncovered  the  sale  of  the  DVDs  earlier  this  year,  rousing  enquiries  by  ASIO  and  the  Depart  ment  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade.   “I  believe  they  [the  DVDs]  should  be  prohibited  and  action  taken  against  him.”   Reverend  Nile  has  come  under   fire  recently  for  proposing  a  10-year  moratorium  on  Muslim  immigra   tion  to  Australia.   Last  week,  the  Liberal  Party  announced  it  would  give  preferences  to  the  CDP  to  springboard  its  chances  of  gaining  seats  in  the  Upper  House.

"  Labor  frontbencher   reveals  Jewish  heritage   NAOMI  LEVIN   POLITICIANS,  particularly  during  election  campaigns,  often  say  with  varying  degrees  of  sincerity  that  they  understand  the  Jewish  com  munity  and  that  they  have  its  inter  ests  at  heart  However,  there  is  one  Labor  frontbencher  who  does  have  the  credentials  to  express  her  unqualified  concern.   Shadow  minister  for  health  Nicola  Roxon  told  The  AJN  about  her  father,  a  Jew  who  left  Poland  as  a  child  with  his  family  before  the  out  break  of  World  War  II.   Roxon’s  grandfather,  a  Polish  doctor,  sensed  trouble  brewing  in  the  late  1930s  and  decided  to  search  for  a  safer  home  for  his  family.   The  family  initially  moved  to  Italy  before  boarding  a  ship  and  beginning  a  new  life  in  the  rural  Queensland  town  of  Gympie.   “When  my  grandfather  was  unable  to  practise  medicine  in  Poland,  they  moved  to  Italy.  From  there  they  jumped  on  a  boat,  the  first  one  that  came,  and  so  they  came  to  Australia,”  Roxon,  40,  explained.   Roxon’s  grandfather  practised   medicine  in  Gympie,  before  relo  cating  the  family  to  Brisbane.   Roxon,  who  is  now  the  member  for  Gellibrand  -  a  safe  Labor  seat  in  Melbourne’s  inner-west  -  admitted  that,  while  she  does  not  identify  as  a  Jew,  she  has  a  close  relationship  with  a  number  of  Jewish  people  and  sympathises  strongly  with  Israel.  She  visited  the  country  in  2003,  and  is  a  member  of  the  Labor  Friends  of  Israel  committee.   “I  felt  that  it  was  an  important  part  of  my  background  and  I  do  have  a  relationship  and  under  standing,  and  sympathy  as  well,  for  Jewish  people,”  she  said.   Her  mother,  a  non-practising  Anglican,  raised  Roxon  because  her  father,  who  did  not  practise  Judaism,  died  of  cancer  when  she  was  a  child.   “We  celebrated  Christmas,  but  we  didn’t  really  have  a  particularly  religious  household  at  all,”  she  said.   Nonetheless,  she  considers  Judaism  an  important  part  of  her  background  and  says  that  she  often   thinks  about  how  one  side  of  her   family  was  almost  entirely  lost  in   the  Holocaust.

"  Iranian  Jew  is  new  mayor  of  Beverly  Hills  90210   Jimmy  Delshad...  from  Shiraz  to  Beverly   Hills.  Photo:  JTA   TOMTUGEND   BEVERLY  HILLS,  California  -  After  a  cliffhanger  vote  count,  Jimmy  Jamshid  Delshad  will  claim  two  titles  at  his  March  27  inauguration:  mayor  of  Beverly  Hills  and  top  Iranian-born  public  official  in  the   United  States.   The  milestone  is  being  celebrated  not  only  by  Delshads  compatriots  in  the  golden  ghetto  of  Beverly  Hills,  but  also  by  the  extended  Iranian  Jewish  community  of  30,000  in  the  Los  Angeles  area.   The  day  after  the  results  became  clear,  Delshad  marked  his  victory  by  attending  services  at  three  syna  gogues  to  thank  congregants  for  their  support.   Beverly  Hills  is  governed  by  a  five-person  city  council  that  annu  ally  rotates  the  job  of  mayor  among  its  members  in  order  of  seniority.  Delshad,  66,  was  initially  elected  as  a  city  councilman  in  2003.  This  year,  he  served  as  vice-mayor.   In  this  election,  voters  had  to  choose  from  among  six  candidates  -  half  of  them  Iranian  Jews  -  to  fill  two  council  seats.  Delshad  was  assured  of  the  mayor’s  post  if  he  placed  first  or  second,  which  he  ultimately  did.   “I  feel  blessed  to  have  been   chosen  by  the  people  of  Beverly  Hills,”  Delshad  told  JTA  in  a  phone  interview.  “As  a  Jewish  youngster  in  Iran,  I  was  a  second-class  citizen  and  kept  running  into  closed  doors.  Through  my  example,  I  hope  to   open  doors  in  America  for  other  people  like  me”   The  English-language  Tehran  Times,  published  in  the  Iranian  cap  ital,  reported  the  election  as  a  straight  news  story.  Delshad  said  he  had  received  congratulatory  emails  from  some  Muslims  in  Iran,  espe  cially  from  former  neighbours  in  his  native  city  of  Shiraz.   Beverly  Hills,  known  for  its  luxu  rious  homes  and  celebrity  residents,  was  an  early  destination  for  wealthy  Iranian  emigres  after  the  Islamic  Revolution  in  1979.   Some  8000  residents  of  Iranian   birth  or  descent,  primarily  Jewish,  now  live  there  among  a  population   ot  Jb.UUU,  according  to  Delshad.   J1A ",2007-03-23

"  NAOMI  LEVIN   YEARS  of  hard  work  by  Jewish  com  munity  leaders  seeking  federal  sup  port  for  growing  security  bills  looks  set  to  reap  dividends,  with  Labor  promising  up  to  $20  million  for  Jew   ish  schools  and  the  Coalition  Govern   ment  considering  a  community-wide  security  package.   Representatives  from  Jewish  schools  said  that  the  Opposition’s  security  plan,  unveiled  at  Sydney’s  Moriah  College,  would  allow  them  to  focus  more  on  classroom  teaching  and  providing  fee  relief.   Rabbi  James  Kennard,  principal  at  Mount  Scopus  College  in  Melbourne,  said  the  funding  pledge  would  make  a  “significant  difference”  for  Jewish  schools.  The  same  message  echoed  from  Melbourne’s  Yeshivah-Beth  Rivkah  Colleges.  It  is  estimated  that  Australian  Jewish  schools  fork  out  $4  million  each  year  on  security.   Rabbi  Kennard  explained  that  Mount  Scopus  has  full-time  security  guards  at  all  three  of  its  campuses  and  spends  a  lot  of  money  on  security  infrastructure.  The  school  also  relies   on  parent  volunteers  to  assist  with  security.  But  he  said  the  school  will  not  know  the  particulars  of  the  secu  rity  funding  until  the  method  of  allo  cation  is  explained.   litis  a  great  comfort  to  |  our  community  that   both  of  the  major   parties  recognise  the  challenges  we  face  in  this  regard  and  are   I  assisting  us  to  keep  our  |  children  safe”   |  MARK  SCHNEIDER   President,  Moriah  College   “We  will  wait  for  details  of  the  additional  funding  as  we  have  been  given  no  indication  of  the  amount  per  school,”  he  said.  “It  will  not  mean  less  reliance  on  volunteers,  as  volun  teers  are  a  vital  part  of  our  security  strategy  and  we  are  extremely  grateful  for  the  role  they  play.”   Moriah  College  president  Mark   Schneider  admitted  it  was  regrettable  that  schools  needed  to  take  such   stringent  security  precautions,  but  said  he  was  glad  the  wider  commu  nity  recognised  this  need.   “It  is  a  great  comfort  to  our  com  munity  that  both  of  the  major  parties  recognise  the  challenges  we  face  in  this  regard  and  are  assisting  us  to  keep  our  children  safe,”  Schneider  said.   The  $20-million  school  security  plan  was  announced  last  Friday  by  Federal  Opposition  Leader  Kevin  Rudd  on  a  red-letter  day  for  Labor.  He  explained  that  the  funding  would   be  available  to  all  schools  but  that  it  would  be  predominantly  directed  at  Jewish  schools.   “We  are  very  conscious  of  the  par  ticular  needs  of  the  Jewish  commu  nity  in  regard  to  security,”  Rudd  said.   Soon  after,  Rudd  and  his  educa  tion  spokesman  Stephen  Smith,  offered  an  extra  $16  million  in  gen  eral  funding  to  Jewish  schools  and   committed  to  the  Howard  Govern   ment’s  changes  to  the  socioeconomic  status  (SES)  funding  appeals  process.   CONTINUED  ON  NEWS  3   Security  boost  for  Jewish  schools   CONTINUED  FROM  NEWS  1   But  the  Howard  Government  -  which  has  already  promised  to  make  fundraising  for  community  security  tax  deductible,  in  addition  to  resolving  a  schools’  funding  anomaly  -  is  poised  to  respond  to  Labor's  security  plans.   Visiting  Mount  Scopus  two  weeks  ago,  Education  Minister  Julie  Bishop  explained  that  the  Coalition  had  already  looked  at  school  security  and  was  finalising  its  own  schools  security  package.   “The  issue  of  ongoing  [security]  funding  is  one  that  we  are  going  to  look  at  with  the  minister  for  justice  and  cus  toms  [David  Johnston]  because  that  would  cross  over  from  just  a  pure  edu  cation  issue,""  Bishop  told  the  AIN  earlier  this  month.   “We're  not  talking  about  the  employment  of  teachers,  we  are  talking  about  the  employment  of  security  per  sonnel  essentially.”   On  the  same  day  as  Rudd’s   announcement,  Bishop's  cabinet  col  league,  Malcolm  Turnbull,  unveiled  the  tax  scheme  for  community  donations  towards  its  own  security.   “I  am  delighted  that  the  prime  min  ister  has  decided  that  a  new  commu  nal  security  body  -  the  Council  for  Jewish  Community  Security,  which  will  be  established  by  the  Executive  Coun  cil  of  Australian  Jewry  -  will  be  listed  as  a  deductible  gift  recipient  under  the  Income  Tax  Assessment  Act,”  Turnbull  said  in  a  statement.   The  federal  environment  minister  said  that  these  tax-deductible  dona  tions  would  be  allocated  to  all  Jewish  organisations,  not  just  to  schools.   Turnbull  is  involved  in  a  fascinating  battle  with  Labor  candidate  George  Newhouse,  whose  campaign  was  bol  stered  by  the  alternative  prime  minis  ter’s  visit  to  his  electorate  last  week.

"  A  Jewish  call  to  arms   THEY  were  six  days  that  shook   the  world.  A  profoundly  trans  formational  event  in  Jewish  history,  the  1967  Six-Day  War  and  its  ripples,  still  ricochet  through  Mid-East  politics.   For  those  born  after  the  war,  it's  hard  to  fathom  how  seriously  world  Jewry  took  president  Nasser  of  Egypt’s  threat  to  drive  Israel  into  the  sea.  Time  magazine  reported  that  Jews  from  every  country  went  into  debt,  cashing  in  securities  and  life  insurance,  that  teenagers  turned  over  their  bar-  and  bat-mitzvah  money  to  help  Israel.  The  small  Jewish  congregation  of  Okmulgee,  Oklahoma,  even  sold  its  syn  agogue  and  wired  the  funds  to  Tel  Aviv.   Others  hopped  on  planes  so  they  could  enlist.  The  total  expression  of  Jew  ish  identification,  vulnerability  and  responsibility  swelled  up  to  levels  unseen  since,1948.   The  anxiety  was  so  palpable  that  Jewish  writer  Manes  Sperber  exclaimed  on  the  eve  the  war  that,  ""Any  attack  on  the  State  of  Israel  would  be  as  intolera  ble  as  the  resumptions  of  the  crematory  ovens  arid  gas  chambers  of  Auschwitz  in  front  of  Notre  Dame.”   Likewise,  Jewish  philosopher  Hanna   Arendt  told  her  close  friend  Mary  McCarthy  that  Israel’s  destruction  would  be,  for  her,  the  greatest  disaster  imagi  nable.  Elie  Wiesel  admitted  that  the  Six  Day  War  produced  a  change  in  him  that  was  so  total  that  it  involved  his  very  being,  both  as  a  person  and  a  Jew.  For  him,  the  end  of  Israel  would  mean  the  end  of  man.   Successive  governments  have  tried  to  deal   with  the  Palestinian  issue;  some  politicians,  such  as  Yitzchak  Rabin,  paid  with  their  life  for  boldly  dealing  with  the  most  significant  issue  on  the  national  agenda.   Mobilised  in  48  hours,  the  Israeli  ground  troops  and  pilots  reminded  the  world  that  dynamism  and  bravery  were  Tzahal's  chief  asset  A  military  campaign  that  is  still  considered  the  most  spec  tacular  and  decisive  since  World  War  II,  in  barely  130  hours  the  Israeli  Army  demolished  the  armies  and  air  forces  of   enemy  Arab  states  and  expanded  the  borders  of  Israel.  It  reversed  the  balance  of  power  in  the  Mid-East  forever.   BBC  correspondent  in  Israel  Michael  Elkins  reported  that,  “Israel  has  created  the  nearest  thing  to  instant  victory  the  modern  world  has  ever  seen.”   The  geyser  of  euphoria  that  followed  the  Six-Day  War  was  understandable.  The  lightning  victory  was  seen  as  finally  guaranteeing  the  survival  of  Israel  by  its  proof  of  military  superiority.  World  Jewry   breathed  a  sigh  of  relief  when  the  Jewish  State  smashed  the  encircling  armies  that  had  the  unavoidably  genocidal  goal  of  obliterating  the  national  ingathering  of  the  Jews.  Golda  Meir  was  right  when  she  said  after  1967  that  Jews  are  used  to  collective  eulogies,  but  Israel  will  not  'die,  '.  ;  7-  ■   The  iconic  photographs  of  Israeli  sol  diers  making  their  devotion  at  the  West  ern  Wall  of  the  temple  and  the  image  of   Rabbi  Goren  blowing  his  shofar  at  the  newly  liberated  Kotel  is  an  indelible,  enduring  image.  David  Ben-Gurion,  in  his  diaries,  insisted  on  maintaining  Jewish  control  over  the  city,  a  principle  still  shared  by  most  Jews  and  Israelis.   Israeli  poet  Natan  Alterman  asserted  that  this  victory  erased  the  division  between  the  State  of  Israel  and  the  Land  of  Israel,  marking  the  return  of  the  Jews  to  their  nation’s  ancient  and  exalted  possessions.   Another  unprecedented  aspect  was  that  by  war’s  end,  Israel  was  actually  stronger,  its  security  enhanced.  Never  again,  it  seemed,  would  Israel  be  19  kilometres  wide  and  Jerusalem  be  a  divided  city.   Yet,  however  swift,  the  war  had  not  been  without  cost.  Hundreds  of  Israeli  soldiers  lost  their  lives.  The  awareness  of  the  burden  of  holding  on  to  the  territo  ries  came  later,  along  with  the  enormous  financial,  psychological,  political  and  human  cost.  The  late  Professor  Yeshayahu  Leibowitz  noted  in  1967  that  Israel’s  most  fateful  day  was  the  seventh  day  of  the  war  when  it  assumed  respon  sibility  of  millions  of  Palestinians.   This  unresolved  predicament  has   dominated  Israeli  politics.  Successive  governments  have  tried  to  deal  with  the  Palestinian  issue;  some  politicians,  such  as  Yitzchak  Rabin,  paid  with  their  life  for  boldly  dealing  with  the  most  significant  issue  on  the  national  agenda.   On  June  11,  prime  minister  Levi  Eshkol  walked  into  his  office  to  meet  his  top  advisers.  He  said,  “What  are  you  so  happy  about?""   His  aid  recounts,  ""Eshkol’s  mood  was  surprisingly  sober.  He  saw  that  our  polit  ical  problems  were  just  beginning.”   In  truth,  the  early  hopes  were  that  the  majority  of  the  lands  could  be  traded  for  peace  agreements,  but  such  hopes  were  dashed  on  September  1,  1967,  when  the  Arab  states  convened  in  Khartoum,  Sudan,  and  announced,  “No  negotia  tions,  no  recognition  of  Israel,  and  no  peace.”   Syria  is  still  one  of,  Israel’s  implaca  ble  enemies,  providing  money  and  train  ing  to  Hamas  and  Hezbollah.   And  with  the  daily  shelling  from  Gaza,  Abba  Eban’s  oft-quoted  phrase  comes  to  mind:  “The  Palestinians  never  miss  an  opportunity  to  miss  an  opportu  nity  for  peace.”   How  little  has  changed.

"  Jewish  dissenters   blasted  for  ‘naivety’   ALAN  THORNHILL   A  GROUP  of  British  Jews’  condemna  tion  of  Israel’s  policies  towards  the  Palestinians  is  naive  and  amounts  to  “appeasement”,  Jewish  leaders  said   this  week.   A  chorus  of  condemnation  greeted  the  declaration  this  week  from  more  than  130  British  Jews,  who  said  the  Jewish  establishment  in  Britain  puts  support  for  Israel  above  the  human  rights  of  the  Palestinian  people.   But  local  author  and  outspoken  Israel  critic  Antony  Lowenstein  vowed  to  set  up  a  similar  “breakaway  group”   in  Australia.   The  signatories  to  the  British  dec  laration,  made  by  a  group  calling  itself  Independent  Jewish  Voices,  include  comedian  Stephen  Fry,  film-maker  Mike  Leigh,  playwright  Harold  Pinter  and  historian  Eric  Hobsbawn.   Another  signatory,  Brian  Klug,  an  Oxford  philosopher,  attacked  Chief  Rabbi  Sir  Jonathan  Sacks,  who  declared  at  a  pro-Israeli  rally  in  Lon  don  last  year:  “Israel,  you  make  us  proud.”   Klug  disagreed,  in  an  article  accompanying  the  Independent  Voices  declaration  saying:  ""Others  felt  roughly  the  opposite  emotion.”   However,  Jewish  MP  Michel  Danby  rejected  that  statement.   “I  proudly  stand  with  Rabbi  Sacks   against  this  climate  of  appeasement,”   he  said.   “You  would  think  Israel’s  with  drawal  from  Gaza  [in  2005]  had  never  happened,”  Danby  said.   Yet  the  Palestinians  had  responded  to  that  withdrawal  by  electing  a  Hamas  government  committed  to  wiping  out  the  State  of  Israel,  he  said.   Danby  asked  where  Harold  Pinter  and  the  other  signatories  to  the  decla  ration  had  been  when  Iranian  Presi  dent  Mahmoud  Ahmadinejad  had  been  pictured  with  Neturei  Karta  members  at  the  recent  Holocaust  denial  conference  in  Iran.   Former  Hawke  Government  min   ister  Barry  Cohen  was  equally  blunt.   He  said  that  while  members  of  the   Independent  Jewish  Voices  group  are  entitled  to  their  views,  he  does  not  share  them.  “You  know  the  old  story  -  three  Jews,  four  opinions,”  Cohen   said.   Anti-Israel  and  antisemitic  views  were  rampant  in  the  artistic  and  aca  demic  worlds  in  which  Stephen  Fry,  Harold  Pinter  and  the  other  signato  ries  move,  he  claimed.  “I  think  they  want  to  align  themselves  with  that  and  be  adored  by  members  of  that  milieu;  at  least  by  the  loony  left,”  Cohen  said.

"  Today  I  am  a  learned  Jew   TORAH  TOPIC  ^   RABBI  ELISHA  GREENBAUM   שלח   TOO  many  of  the  bar  mitzvah   boys  I  meet  spend  an  inordinate  amount  of  time  preparing  “their  parsha”.  They  focus  all  their  energies  on  sounding  and  looking  good  on  the  day,  while  any  attempt  to  develop  an  all-round  appreciation  and  under  standing  of  Judaism  gets  shunted  to  the  back  of  the  priority  queue.   My  personal  belief  is  that  the  15  minute  ""performance”  in  shul  is  a  nachas  ceremony  for  his  grandpar  ents;  important,  but  not  nearly  as  vital  as  setting  up  a  young  man  for  a  lifetime  of  discovery  and  learning.   Even  those  who  do  attempt  to  teach  more  than  just  trope  and  time   tend  to  focus  more  on  the  “hows”  of   Judaism  than  the  “whys”.  They  emphasise  the  minutiae  of  details  in  fulfilling  practices,  ignoring  their  rea   sons  and  rationale.   Regrettably,  this  fault  is  shared  by  many  well-intentioned  educators  at  even  the  best  Jewish  educational  insti  tutions.  I  am  sick  of  meeting  young  adults,  graduates  of  our  finest  acade  mies,  who  profess  no  faith  in  religion.  Were  this  to  be  a  self-developed  belief  based  on  their  own  research  and   reflection,  I  would  be  disappointed  but  prepared  to  accept  them  on  then  own  terms.  Unforgivably  however,  the  single  most  common  complaint  I  hear  is  that  many  teachers  actively  discourage  their  students  from  ques  tioning  religion.  It  is  this  attitude  that  drove  the  student  to  abandon  all  belief.   They  are  right.  A  religion  that  can’t  stand  up  to  scrutiny,  where  people  are  made  to  feel  guilty  for  daring  to  probe  beyond  the  superficial,  is  a  religion  I’d  probably  flee  from  as  well.  The  strength  and  beauty  of  authentic  Yid  dishkeit  is  encapsulated  precisely  in  the  principle  that  nothing  is  off  limits;  one  can  ask  and  indeed  is  expected  to  examine  the  logic  of  all  practices  and   facets  of  our  faith.   We  read  this  week  how  the  Jews  sent  spies  to  scout  the  land  of  Israel.  Upon  return,  they  reported  that  they  would  never  be  able  to  conquer  the  land’s  current  inhabitants.  The  people  believed  them  and  spent  the  night  complaining;  the  spies  died  a  horrible  death  and  the  nation  was  condemned  to  40  years  of  wandering.   Hashem  gave  His  people  a  mission  and  we  were  expected  to  flesh  out  the  details  by  using  our  own  intellects.  Sending  the  spies  was  a  legitimate  and  perfectly  justified  tool  to  help  under  take  this  task.  There  was,  and  is,  noth  ing  wrong  in  seeking  to  understand  the  command  of  God.  There  can  be   no  complaints  if  a  seeker  honestly   wishes  to  discover  for  themselves  the  most  effective  method  of  fulfilling  a   task.   The  mistake  of  the  spies  lay  not  so  much  in  their  bringing  back  flawed  information,  rather  in  confusing  reporting  with  opinion.  Instead  of  determining  the  best  method  to  carry  out  the  assignment,  they  independ  ently  decided  that  they  would  never  be  successful  in  conquering  the  land   and  decided  to  abandon  their  mission  and  remain  in  the  desert.   The  dual  track  of  Judaism  -  the  immortal  promise  we  pledged  while  standing  at  Sinai,  to  do  and  to  listen  -  the  how  and  the  why,  are  both  imper  atives  to  a  mature  acceptance  of  Judaism.  We  must  think  and  act  for  ourselves  based  on  our  own  consid  ered  understanding.  We  may  ask  questions  of  our  Creator;  indeed,  engaging  in  a  dialogue  with  God  is  the  true  sign  of  genuine  devotion.  However,  the  underlying  tenet  of  our  faith  is  that  even  while  on  our  quest  to  understand  His  rationales,  it  is  our  responsibility  and  privilege  to  uncon  ditionally  devote  ourselves  to  God’s  mission,  confident  in  the  knowledge  that  there  can  be  nothing  more  logi  cal  than  conforming  to  the  will  of   Hashem.

"  VATICAN  CITY  -  Jewish  groups  have  harshly  criticised  a  decision  by  Pope  Benedict  XVI  to  sanction  greater  use   of  an  old  Latin  mass  that  includes  a   prayer  for  the  conversion  of  Jews.   The  US-based  Anti-Defamation   League  (ADL)  has  described  the  move  as  a  “body  blow  to  Catholic-Jewish  relations”,  while  the  Simon  Wiesenthal  Centre  has  urged  the  Vatican  to   reconsider.   Abraham  Foxman,  the  ADL’s  national  director,  met  this  week  in  Rome  with  Vatican  officials  to  press  Jewish  concerns  over  the  revival  of  the  so-called  Tridentine  Mass,  as  well  as  the  possible  beatification  of  Holo  caust-era  Pope  Pius  XII.  Foxman  expressed  concern  about  the  papal  permit  allowing  the  use  of  a  16th-cen  tury  prayer  that  beseeches  God  to   “remove  the  veil  from  the  hearts”  of   the  Jews,  so  that  they  may  also  “acknowledge  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ”.   “We  are  extremely  disappointed  and  deeply  offended  that,  nearly  40  years  after  the  Vatican  rightly  removed  insulting  anti-Jewish  language  from   the  Good  Friday  Mass,  it  would  now  permit  Catholics  to  utter  such  hurtful  and  insulting  words  by  praying  for  Jews  to  be  converted,”  Foxman  said.  “This  is  a  theological  setback  in  the  religious  life  of  Catholics  and  a  body  blow  to  Catholic-Jewish  relations.”   ""It  appears  the  Vatican  has  chosen  to  satisfy  a  right-wing  faction  in  the  Church  that  rejects  change  and  recon  ciliation,”  he  added.   In  the  1970  missal  of  Paul  VI  -   which  is  currently  used  -  the  prayer  for  the  conversion  of  Jews  was  replaced  by  a  positive  prayer  recog  nising  the  Jews’  eternal  covenant  with  God,  a  principle  to  which  the  previous  Pope  John  Paul  II  was  deeply   committed.   In  addition  to  Jewish  concerns,  bishops  in  France  and  liberal-minded  clergy  and  faithful  elsewhere  expressed  concerns  that  allowing  freer  use  of  the  Tridentine  liturgy  would  imply  a  negation  of  the  liberal  mes  sage  of  Vatican  II  and  create  divisions  in  parishes,  since  two  different  litur  gies  would  be  celebrated.   ADL  director  Abe  Foxman...  “hurtful  and  Insulting  words”.   Foxman  also  discussed  the  possible  beatification  of  Pope  Pius  XII,  the  Holocaust-era  pontiff  accused  of   silence  in  the  face  of  the  Nazi  extermi   nation  of  European  Jewry.  Foxman  said  that  Pius  should  not  be  granted  a  step  towards  sainthood  until  the  Vat   ican’s  wartime  archives  are  released  for   Pope  Benedict  XVI...  revives  discarded   prayer.

"  Wentworth  steals  Jewish  political  crown   JASON  FRENKEL   SYDNEY  has  stolen  the  title  of  Aus  tralia’s  Jewish  political  heartland  from   Melbourne.   Census  figures  show  Malcolm  Turnbull’s  Wentworth  electorate  has  186  more  Jews  than  the  Bayside  seat  of  Melbourne  Ports  -  historically  con  sidered  the  division  with  the  highest  proportion  of  Jewish  voters.   Labor  MP  Michael  Danby  has  pre  viously  speculated  that  up  to  30  per  cent  of  his  constituents  are  Jewish.   But  the  latest  data,  released  last  week,  shows  Wentworth  has  a  higher  ratio  of  Jewish  voters  (14.1  per  cent)  than  Melbourne  Ports,  where  12.7  per  cent  of  residents  nominated  Judaism  as  their  religion  on  last  year’s  census   paper.   When  the  figures  are  adjusted  to  include  the  estimated  one-in-five  Jews  who  omit  their  faith  from  the  survey,  the  2006  statistics  suggest  17  per  cent  of  Wentworth  is  Jewish.  In  compar  ison,  Melbourne  Ports  would  be  15  per  cent.   Overall,  however,  Victoria  still  had  more  Jews  than  NSW,  41,105  to  36,716.   This  is  the  first  time  the  Australian   Bureau  of  Statistics  has  given  pundits  the  chance  to  analyse  census  figures  along  federal  electoral  boundary  lines.   About  half  of  Sydney’s  Jews  (18,215)  live  in  Bondi,  Dover  Heights,  Vaucluse,  Double  Bay  and  other  sub  urbs  in  Wentworth  -  the  country’s  smallest  geographical  electorate  at  just  29  square  kilometres.   Elsewhere  in  Sydney,  about  6500   Jews  living  on  the  north  shore  are  rep  resented  by  frontbenchers  Brendan  Nelson  and  Joe  Hockey,  while  nearly  4000  have  former  Midnight  Oil   frontman  Peter  Garrett  as  their  local   MP  in  Kingsford  Smith.   Fewer  than  500  Jews  can  take  their  problems  to  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  in  Bennelong,  while  the  218  living  in  Opposition  Leader  Kevin  Rudd’s  Queensland  electorate  of  Grif  fith  will  be  hoping  his  tilt  at  The  Lodge  is  successful  later  this  year.   CONTINUED  ON  NEWS  4   Wentworth  steals  Jewish  crown   CONTINUED  FROM  NEWS  1   The  figures  suggest  an  elec  torate’s  religious  make-up  does  not  necessarily  dictate  an  MP’s  support  for  Israel.   Sydney  MP  Tanya  Plibersek,  one  of  Parlia  ment’s  most  vocal  critics  of  the  Jewish  State,  has  almost  identical  numbers  of  Jewish  and  Muslim  residents,  while  shadow  foreign  minister  Robert  McClelland,  an  Israel  supporter,  has  just  300  Jew  ish  constituents  among  nearly  10,000  Muslim  voters   in  his  electorate  of  Barton.   In  Perth,  one  in  three  Jews  lives  in  the  electorate  of  Stirling,  but  the  vast  expanse  of  Kalgoorlie  -  the  nation’s  largest  geographical  elec  torate  is  79,000  times  the  size  of  Wentworth  -  is  home   to  just  58  Jewish  people.   Turnbull  was  gracious  about  pinching  the  title  from  Melbourne.  “I  regard  it  as  an  enormous  privilege  to  represent  the  largest  Jewish  constituency  in  Australia,  and  greatly  admire  the  Jew  ish  community’s  generous  spirit,  family  pride  and  tire  less  enterprise,”  he  said  when   told  of  the  news.   Danby  did  not  return  calls  from  the  AJN.   In  total,  88,832  Aus  tralians  identified  as  Jewish  in  last  year’s  census,  up  from  83,993  in  2001.   But  Sydney  demographer  Dr  Gary  Eckstein  estimates  Australia’s  Jewish  popula  tion  to  be  around  109,000.   Dr  Eckstein,  who  works  with  the  Hebrew  Univer   sity’s  School  of  Demogra  phy,  said  the  margin  for   error  could  be  attributed  to   Holocaust  survivors  who  have  historical  emotional  issues  with  declaring  their  religion.

"  Candidate  slips  on  Jewish  wallets   JENNIFER  SIEGEL   WASHINGTON   According  to  Repub  lican  presidential  hopeful  Tommy  Thompson  (pictured),  making  money  is  “part  of  the  Jewish  tradition”  -  not  that   there  s  anything  wrong  with  that.   Thompson,  a  former  governor  of  the  US  State  of  Wisconsin  who  is  pursuing  a  long-shot  bid  for  the  White  House,  made  the  remark  last  week  during  an  address  in  Washington  at  the  convention  of  the  Religious  Action  Centre  of  Reform   Judaism.   “I'm  sort  of  a  reform  public  servant,  38  years  in  the  government,”  Thompson  said,  in  what  some  attendees  described  as  an   attempt  at  humour.  “I’m  in  the  private  sector,  and  for  the  first  time  in  my  life  I’m  earning  money.  You  know  that’s  sort  of  part  of  the  Jewish  tradition,  and  I  do  not  find  anything  wrong  with  that.  I  enjoy  that.”   While  some  bloggers  and  other  internet  pundits  poked  fun  at  Thompson's  comment  regarding  Jews  and  money,  the  head  of  the  Anti-Defamation  League  (ADL)  believes  that  it  is  no  laughing   matter.   “It's  a  very  sinister,  dangerous  compli  ment,  because  it  builds  on  a  stereotype  that  has  been  very  costly  to  the  Jewish  people,""  said  Abraham  Foxman,  national  director  of  the  ADL.   Thompson  has  repeatedly  apologised  for  his  remark,  but  it  remains  a  hot  topic  of  discussion  in  the  American  Jewish   press.   THE  FORWARD ",2007-04-27
"  Jewish  float  rejoins  Mardi  Gras   NICOLE  BRESKIN   A  JEWISH  contingent  will  reclaim  its  place  in  this  year’s  Sydney  Gay  &amp;  Les  bian  Mardi  Gras  after  opting  out  last  year  due  to  a  lack  of  interest.   But  thanks  to  a  surge  in  member  ship,  Dayenu,  Sydney’s  Jewish  gay  and-lesbian  support  and  social  group,   will  don  T-shirts  adorned  with  a  Magen  David,  gay-pride  colours  and  the  word  “dayenu”  in  Hebrew  for  this  year’s  parade  on  March  3.   Dayenu  co-founder  Malcolm  Davidowitz  said  he  was  glad  the  group  was  rejoining  the  parade  “to  show  that  Dayenu  has  not  lost  its   momentum”.   Davidowitz  said  the  group  now  boasts  a  “new  wave  of  people  coming  on  board,  who  are  younger  and  involved”.  He  said  groups  from  Habonim  Dror  and  Netzer  may  also  join  the  Dayenu  contingent.   Dayenu,  which  now  has  around  100  members,  made  its  controversial  debut  at  the  2000  Mardi  Gras  with  around  70  marchers.  Last  year  was  the  first  time  since  its  inception  that  the  group  did  not  participate.   Float  organiser  Roy  Freeman  said  the  importance  of  Jewish  participa  tion  in  the  parade  was  twofold:  “It’s  important  for  both  communities,  the  gay  and  lesbian  [community]  to  know  about  the  Jewish  presence  and   vice  versa.”   Dayenu  raised  around  $2000  to  fund  the  float  from  Shabbat  dinners  and  other  social  events,  as  well  as  a  concert  at  Temple  Emanuel  Wool  lahra.  Dayenu  does  not  receive  any   Members  of  the  next  generation  of   Dayenu.  They  will  march  in  the  2007   Sydney  Gay  &amp;  Lesbian  Mardi  Gras  parade.   financial  support  from  Jewish  com  munity  roof  bodies  or  funds.   Dayenu’s  participation  in  the  2000  event  prompted  widespread  condem  nation  from  the  Orthodox  rabbinate.   Rabbi  Chaim  Ingram  of  the  Rab  binical  Council  of  NSW  this  week  said:  “Our  position  on  this  year’s  float  is  what  is  has  always  been:  we  do  not  support  any  exhibitionists  acts  of  this   nature.   “Any  displays  of  this  nature  are  contrary  to  Jewish  and  Torah  values.”   Last  month,  Aleph,  Melbourne’s  Jewish  gay  and  lesbian  network  group,  took  part  in  the  city’s  annual  Pride  March  with  an  Indonesian  Muslim.

"  Third  Jewish  MP  for  NSW   YONI  BASHAN   DR  John  Kaye  has  become  the  third  Jewish  MP  in  the  NSW  Parliament,  following  his  election  to  the  Upper  House  at  Saturday’s  state  poll.   Dr  Kaye,  51,  who  was  second  on  the  Greens  ticket,  qualified  for  the  Upper  House  after  polling  eight  per  cent  of   the  vote.   “It’s  a  great  outcome  for  us,  for  the  things  we  believe  in  -  and  it’s  a  record  for  the  Greens,”  Dr  Kaye  told  the  AJN.   Dr  Kaye  joins  two  other  Jews  in  the  Upper  House:  Greens  member  Ian  Cohen  and  Roads  Minister  Eric  Roozendaal,  who  is  widely  tipped  for  a  ministerial  promotion  (see  story,  right).   The  51-year-old  university  lecturer  said  the  increased  Greens  presence  would  enhance  debate  in  the  house,  especially  on  issues  relating  to  the  Jew  ish  community  and  Israel.   “We  can’t  always  accept  what  the  Israeli  Government  does,  but  my  motivation  has  always  been  peace  and  security  in  the  Middle  East,  and  that’s  where  the  Greens  are  coming  from.”   But  Roozendaal  called  on  Dr  Kaye  to  explain  his  party’s  history  of  attacks  on  Israel.  “Does  John  Kaye  really  believe  that  Israelis  do  not  have  the  right  to  defend  themselves?  It’s  not  good  enough  to  hide  behind  simplistic  calls  for  peace  to  cover  up  his  party’s  blatant  opposition  to  Israel.”   Senior  Jewish  leaders  have  also  expressed  concern  about  the  party  and  its  growing  clout  in  the  Upper  House.   Zionist  Federation  of  Australia  president  Philip  Chester  said  the   Dr  John  Kaye  has  become  the  third  Jewish  member  of  NSW  Parliament.

The  only  other  Jewish  candidate,  Labor’s  Michelle  Miran,  looked  unlikely  to  oust  Liberal  MP  Shelley   Hancock  in  the  seat  of  South  Coast  as  the  count  continued  after  the  AJN  went  to  press.   “This  one’s  gone.  [Hancock]  is  about  3000  votes  in  front  and  it  would  take  an  enormous  amount  in  postal   votes  and  absentee  votes  to  take  it  back,”  she  told  the  AJN. ",2007-03-30

"  Decorated  Jewish   digger  dies,  aged  99   JOSHUA  LEVI   AUSTRALIA’S  oldest  Jewish  digger,  Major-General  Paul  Cullen,  was  hon  oured  at  a  military  funeral  on  Wednes  day  following  his  death  last  week  at  Sydney’s  Montefiore  Home,  five  months  shy  of  his  100th  birthday.   Major-General  Cullen,  who  was  the  second  Australian  Jew  to  hold  the  rank  after  Sir  John  Monash,  fought  for  the  Australian  Defence  Force  (ADF)  against  the  Italian,  German  and   French  armies  in  Palestine  in  1940.   He  was  the  first  president  of  Aust  care,  a  world  humanitarian  founda  tion,  and,  from  1979-81,  was  president  of  Sydney’s  JewishCare.   Former  ADF  senior  Rabbi  Ray  mond  Apple  said  Major-General  Cullen  was  not  only  a  great  general,  but  also  a  community  figure  who  proudly  wore  his  military  medals  and  digger’s  hat.   “He  was  highly  involved  in  the  establishment  of  Liberal  Judaism  in  Sydney.  In  his  army  career,  he  was  a  general  who  combined  great  organisa  tional  ability  and  personal  daring.  He  continued  to  inspire  the  Australian  defence  establishment  and  the  Jewish  ex-service  movement  right  into  his  late  90s.  His  pioneering  work  for  refugees  helped  to  make  Australia’s  reputation   in  this  field  of  humanitarian  endeav   Major-General  Paul  Cullen...  died  last  week,  aged  99.

Major-General  Cullen’s  official  ADF  biographer,  Dr  Kevin  Baker,  said  that  although  he  fought  in  North  Africa,  Greece,  Papua  New  Guinea  and  on  the  Kokoda  Campaign,  he  never  forgot  about  the  casualties  of  war.   “He  had  been  heavily  involved  in  assisting  refugees  since  1936.  He  was  a  founding  member  of  Austcare  and,  in  1981,  was  awarded  the  United  Nations’  medal  for  his  work  with  refugees.  He  also  contributed  to  a  range  of  commu  nity  activities,  and  was  a  director  of  the  Royal  Blind  Society  and  its  president  for  17  years,”  Dr  Baker  said.   Wesley  Browne,  president  of  the  Federal  Association  of  Jewish  Ex-Ser  vicemen  and  Women,  said  Major  General  Cullen  was  “the  most  senior  Jewish  ex-serviceman  in  Australia,  and  probably  the  most  decorated”.   Away  from  the  military,  he  had  sev  eral  business  interests,  including  co  founding  Festival  Records.  He  set  up  Australia’s  first  unit  trust  in  1936,  and  its  first  merchant  bank,  Mainguard,  in   1952.

"  Jewish  helping  hand  for  Rwandan  orphans   JUSTIN  SULSKY   NEW  YORK  -  Anne  Heyman  heard  a  statistic  nearly  two  years  ago  that  would  change  her  life:  Fifteen  per  cent  of  Rwandan  children  are  orphans  due  to  the  1994  genocide  that  murdered  800,000  people  in  100  days.   “I  couldn’t  let  go  of  this  notion,”  said  Heyman.  “There  was  really  no   future  for  Rwanda.”   Heyman,  a  non-practicing  attorney  bom  in  South  Africa,  has  spent  the  past  two  years  pushing  for  the  creation  of  a  Jewish-sponsored  institution  in  Rwanda  to  help  tackle  the  dire   situation.   Her  determination  is  paying  off  -  she  attended  a  groundbreaking  cere  mony  on  Friday  in  Rwamagana,  Rwanda,  for  the  Agahozo  Shalom  Youth  Village,  which  will  serve  500  impoverished  orphans.   Agahozo  -  Kinyarwanda  for  “the  place  where  tears  are  dried”  -  is  mod  elled  after  the  Youth  Aliyah  Village  of  Yemin  Orde,  which  was  founded  in  1953  and  initially  housed  Holocaust  orphans.   To  help  realise  her  vision,  Heyman  turned  to  the  American  Jewish  Joint  Distribution  Committee  (JDC).  Israeli  officials,  including  many  Ethiopian  Israelis,  have  been  involved  in  the  formulation  of  the  youth  vil  lage.   “We  will  strive  to  the  extent  that   it’s  possible  to  create  a  normal  envi  ronment,”  Heyman  said.  “As  far  as  I  know  it’s  unprecedented.”   The  JDC  is  promising  that  the  vil  lage  will  provide  Rwandan  orphans,  many  of  diem  infected  with  HIV  and  suffering  from  AIDS,  with  a  “safe,  structured  environment  with  a  rich  community  life  where  children  are  exposed  to  all  elements  of  parental  and  familial  normalcy,  thereby  pro  viding  wholeness  in  the  wake  of   destruction”.   “Jews  have  a  collective  experience  with  the  Rwandans,  having  come  through  genocide,”  said  Will  Recant,  the  JDC’s  assistant  executive  vice  president.  “We’re  very  much  invested  in  the  long  term  ...  to  make  this  happen.”   Heyman  said  she  hopes  that  stu   A  child  In  need  in  an  African  refugee   camp.

The  school  is  set  to  open  in  2009   and  Heyman  hopes  to  start  villages  in  other  parts  of  Africa.   Heyman  said  in  order  to  provide  the  greatest  benefit,  the  JDC  is  trying  to  hire  as  many  qualified  Rwandan  people  and  companies.  But  due  to  the  shortage  of  qualified  Rwandan  teach  ers,  she  said,  some  positions  will  be  filled  from  outside  the  country.   Recant,  who  has  extensive  experi  ence  leading  the  JDC’s  nonsectarian  humanitarian  programs,  said  those  not  often  exposed  to  Jews  and  Israelis  gain  a  great  appreciation  for  them  when  they  see  the  work  being  done  by  Jewish  organisations.   “The  work  itself  speaks  volumes,”  he  said.  “They  see  we  have  no  horns.”   “I’ve  never  felt  more  warmly  wel  comed  as  a  Jew  than  at  any  other  time  while  doing  humanitarian  work,”  Heyman  said.  “There’s  a  tremendous  sense  of  admiration  and  respect  toward  Israel”  as  they  see  how  much  the  Jewish  State  achieved  in  so  little   time.   “This  project,”  she  said,  “really  brings  back  Israel  as  being  a  light   unto  the  nations  ”   JTA ",2007-08-24

India  has  a  rich  Jewish  history  starting  more  than  2000  years  ago  with  the  establishment  of  the  Bene   Israel  community,  which  prompted  Melbourne  travel  agent  Paulette  Cherny  of  Voyager  Travel  Corporation  to  organise  tours  of  Jewish  India.   The  first  tour  was  held  earlier  this  year  and  proved  so  successful  that  more  tours  to  India  are  being  planned   for  2008.   The  first  Jewish  India  tour  was  led  by  Paulette  and  Rabbi  Philip   Heilbrunn  of  St  Kilda  Hebrew   Congregation.  For  11  days  the  group   of  12  Australians  and  one  South  African  visited  the  cities  of  Mumbai,  Cochin  and  New  Delhi.   Indian  guides  Yael  and  Ralphy  Jhirad,  who  are  long-standing  members  of  Mumbai's  Bene  Israel  community,  organised  several  meetings  with  the  local  Jewish  community  as  well  as  some  special  treats:  Shabbat  meal  organised  by  community  leaders,  guided  tours  of  historic  shuls  and  even  an  invitation  to  an  Indian  Jewish  wedding!   India  has  a  population  of  more  than  a  billion  people  and  is  predomi  nantly  Hindu.  The  Jewish  community  today  numbers  about  5000,  with  almost  4000  living  in  the  country's  biggest  city  Mumbai  (formerly  Bombay)  which  has  a  population  of   about  13  million.   Included  in  the  tour  were  visits  to   synagogues  for  Shabbat  services,  but  Paulette  explained  that  participants  were  free  to  choose  whether  they  wanted  to   attend  shul  or  do  other  activities.   ""Having  a  rabbi  in  the  group  added  to  the  warm  welcome  by  the  local  Jewish  communities,""  says  Paulette.   ""Most  of  the  shuls  that  we  visited  in  India  did  not  have  a  rabbi,  so  Rabbi  Heilbrunn  would  lead  the  services.""   Organising  a  kosher  tour  was  not   difficult  as  the  major  hotels  catered  for  the  strictly  vegetarian  Brahmins.   On  the  first  day  of  the  tour  the  group  travelled  by  boat  and  bus  from  Mumbai  to  the  rural  village  of  Alibaug,  near  the  place  where  India's  Bene  Israel  community  was  founded  more  than  2000  years  ago.  It  has  one  of  the  oldest  Jewish  cemeteries  in  the  world.   Tour  leader  Paulette  Cherny  with  an  Indian  guard.   Relaxed  atmosphere  in  the  historic  Alibag  synagogue.

""At  the  town's  small  synagogue,   Rabbi  Heilbrunn  read  the  Torah  from  ancient  scrolls,  while  outside,  goats  were  bleating,  coconut  palms  were  swaying  in  the  breeze  and  a  Muslim   funeral  procession  passed  by,""  said   Paul.   ""After  the  service,  we  had  lunch  at  the  home  of  the  synagogue's  presi   dent  on  his  coconut  and  betel-nut  plantation.""

""The  service  had  an  eerie  air  of  familiarity  and  unfamiliarity.  Familiar  prayers  were  scattered  with  unfamiliar   words.  Familiar  procedures,  such  as  opening  the  ark,  were  accompanied  by   unfamiliar  rituals.   ""That  night  we  were  hosted  by  members  of  the  Bene  Israel  community  to  an  extraordinary  gourmet  banquet   of  Indian  delicacies  at  our  hotel  in  Mumbai.

""Ralphy  arranged  for  one  of  the  con  gregation's  elders  to  open  the  synagogue  for  us.  Inside  it  was  very  beautiful,  with  a  Belgian  chandelier  and  wooden  doors  on  the  aron  kodesh  (holy  ark).

They  went,  we  are  told,  from  Rameses  to  Sukkot,  from  Sukkot  to  Etam,  back  to  Pi  Hachirot,  then  to  Marah  and  even  tually  to  the  east  of  the  Jordan?  The  list  covers  42  stopping  places.   In  some  cases,  all  we  get  is  a  name,  not  even  a  hint  of  anything  interesting  that  might  have  hap  pened  there.  It  sounds  even  more  boring  than  the  holiday  snaps  and  movies  that  one  used  to  be  subjected  to  a  decade  or  two  ago,  when  travel  was  less  popular  than  today  and  those  who  travelled  wanted  every  one  to  know  about  their  experiences.   But,  says  Maimonides,  every  nar  rative  in  the  Torah  serves  a  religious  purpose.  In  this  case,  it  reinforces  our  belief  in  miracles,  for  the  desert  had  no  natural  resources  and  all  that   kept  the  people  alive  was  the  mirac   ulous  manna  that  came  from  heaven  every  day.   Sfomo  explains  the  narrative  as  a   compliment  to  Israel.  Yes,  there  were  many  occasions  during  the  40  years  when  they  grumbled  and  rebelled.  They  were  fed  manna:  they  wanted  onions  and  garlic.  They  wanted  water:  it  was  not  always  available.  But  underneath  it  all,  they  were  still  good  people.  The  wandering  seemed  to  take  forever,  yet  they  continued  to   follow  God  and  to  have  faith  that  the  journey  would  be  worthwhile.   There  is  something  for  us  to  learn  there.  We  look  at  Jewish  his  tory  and  wonder  why  our  dream  of  a  quiet  life  is  taking  so  long,  why  the  redemption  is  so  protracted.  But  very  rarely  does  a  Jew  say,  “Jewish  history  is  moving  too  slowly;  I  don’t  want  to  be  a  Jew  anymore!”  Gener  ally,  we  put  up  with  the  journey  and   remain  excited  about  the  destina   tion.  We  may  quarrel  with  God,  but  we  recognise  that  the  pace  of  history  is  out  of  our  hands,  and  that  God  has  said,  “I  the  Lord  will  hasten  it  in  its  time”  (Isaiah  60:22).   The  real  question  is  not  about  where  we  go  on  our  holidays,  but  where  we  go  in  life.  If  we  look  back   over  where  life  as  a  whole  has  taken  us  and  can  find  no  serious  lessons  in   it,  that’s  when  we  have  a  problem.

"  TRACING  JEWS   ENGLISH  JEWISH  FOREBEARS   MY  family  has  long  had  an  understand  ing  that  some  of  our  forebears  who  came  from  England  in  the  1800s  were  Jewish.  I  would  like  to  see  if  anyone  could  help  me  in  my  search  for  a  con  nection.  My  great-great-grandmother,  Eliza  Redman,  was  born  in  about  1865,  but  was  raised  by  her  maternal  aunt,  known  as  Grandma  Pettitt  (after  both  her  parents  died  of  typhoid).  They  lived  in  Emu  Park  and  Rockhampton  in  Cen  tral  Queensland  and  the  extended  fam  ily  ran  most  of  the  businesses  in  the  then  thriving  costal  town  of  Emu  Park:  the  three  hotels,  the  ice  works,  aerated  drinks  factory  and  the  butcher.  Eliza  grew  up  and  married  James  Smith  in   about  1885.   LOUISE  FLETCHER  Louise.FLETCHER@deta.qld.gov.au ",2007-11-02
"  Murdered  French  Jew  Ilan  Halimi  laid  to  rest  in  Jerusalem  cemetery   BRER  KLINE   JERUSALEM  —  Ilan  Halimi,  the  young  French  Jew  kidnapped  and  tortured  to  death  by  an  antisemitic  gang  outside  Paris  last  year  in  a  murder  that  shocked  his  country,  has  found  his  final  rest  in  Jerusalem.   Halimi  was  reburied  in  the  cap  ital’s  Givat  Shaul  cemetery  on  a  warm,  sunny  morning  last  Friday  in  front  of  a  crowd  of  several  hundred  people,  most  of  them  French  immi  grants  to  Israel.   The  day  before,  his  mother,  two  sisters  and  brother-in-law  had  accompanied  the  body  from  Paris,  where  it  was  unearthed  that  morning  from  a  suburban  cemetery.   The  disinterment  and  reburial  were  arranged  by  the  Jewish  Agency  for  Israel  and  Pierre  Besnainou,  pres  ident  of  the  European  Jewish  Con  gress  and  the  United  Social  Funds  of   France.   In  the  cemetery’s  small,  packed  ceremony  room,  family  members  tried  to  prevent  their  faces  from  being  filmed  by  the  many  television  and  press  cameramen  present.  They  did  not  speak  at  the  ceremony  but  lis  tened,  motionless,  to  officials  who  addressed  the  gathering.   Among  the  speakers  were  Israel’s  chief  Sephardic  rabbi,  Shlomo  Amar;  France’s  chief  rabbi,  Joseph  Sitruk;  Jewish  Agency  Chairman  Ze’ev  Bielski;  the  French  ambassador  to  Israel,  Jean  Michel  Casa;  Ze’ev  Boim,  Israel’s  minister  of  immigrant  absorption;  and  Malcolm  Hoenlein,  executive  vice-chairman  of  the  Con   ference  of  Presidents  of  Major  Amer  ican  Jewish  Organisations.   “Why  bury  Ilan  in  Jerusalem?”  Rabbi  Sitruk  asked.  “We  Jews  are  believers,  and  we  believe  there  are  at  least  two  lives,  the  one  on  Earth  and  the  one  we  don’t  see.  Life  on  Earth  ended  for  Ilan  last  year,  and  now  this  is  the  beginning  of  [his]  celestial  voyage.”   Rabbi  Sitruk  choked  back  tears  several  times  during  his  talk.   “Does  Israel  want  to  be  a  big   Mourners  at  the  funeral  of  murdered  French  Jew  Han  Hallml,  who  was  reburied  in  Jerusalem  last  Friday.   cemetery?”  he  asked.  “No,  but  people  who  don’t  come  here  for  life  on  Earth  can  come  here  for  eternal  life.”   “Han  was  murdered  because  he  was  Jewish,”  Bielski  said.  “This  is  an  example  of  racism  and  antisemitism,  and  it  is  unacceptable  to  treat  this  as  an  ordinary  murder.”   “Sometimes  I  feel  like   I'rngoingtowakeup   from  a  bad  dream,  but  I  do  know  that  he  is  gone   forever""   ruth  mum  Mother  of  murdered  Jew   Halimi  was  lured  to  his  kidnap  ping  by  a  young  woman  who  came  to  the  phone  store  where  he  worked  and  feigned  a  romantic  interest.   Members  of  the  gang  reportedly   told  police  after  their  arrest  that  they  wanted  to  kidnap  a  Jew  because  they  believed  all  Jews  were  rich  and  they  could  extract  a  healthy  ransom  from  Halimi’s  family.  When  they  discov  ered  that  the  family  was  of  modest  means,  they  reportedly  said  they  decided  to  kill  Halimi  anyway  because  they  hated  Jews.   Halimi’s  mother,  Ruth,  told  JTA  that  the  ceremony  was  very  difficult,  but  she  was  comforted  by  the  fact  that  her  son  had  been  buried  in  the  Holy  City.   “Sometimes  I  feel  like  I’m  going  to  wake  up  from  a  bad  dream,”  she  said,  “but  I  do  know  that  he  is  gone  forever”.   Ruth  Halimi  said  she  was  moved  by  the  support  she  had  received  from  many  French  people  and  others  around  the  world  after  her  son’s  death.   “Still,  it’s  almost  impossible  to  believe  that  people  knew  a  boy  was   being  tortured  in  their  own  apart  ment  building  and  they  simply  did  not  bother  to  call  the  police,”  she  said.  “If  they  had  bothered  to  call,  Han  might  still  be  alive,  but  they  didn’t.”   JTA   Ruth  Haliml,  Han's  mother,  Is  comforted  during  his  reburial.

The  chap  ter  headings  are  full  of  the  word  “versus"":  Jews  versus  Greeks,  philosophers  versus  Kabbalists,  Orthodoxy  versus  Reform.  For  readers  seeking  an  accessible  understanding  of  the  many  complex  movements  and  layers  of  argumentation  that  run  through  our  history,  this  book  is  a  splendid  introduction.

"  Adam  Goldberg  plays  the  neurotic  Jake  alongside  Julie  Delpy  (French  photographer  Marion)  in  2  Days  in  Paris.   An  American  Jew  in  Paris   Film  review   2  DAYS  IN  PARIS   Reviewed  by  Don  Perfgut   HE  essence  of  a  good  romantic  com  edy  is  to  give  the  characters  some  serious  obstacles  to  overcome.   Whether  physical  (distance,  war),  religious,  cultural  or  psychological,  these  obstacles  infuse  enough  emotional  risk  for  them  so  that  we,  the  viewers,  actually  care  that  they  triumph.   In  the  case  of  2  Days  in  Paris,  it  is  the  per  sonalities  of  the  two  lead  characters  that  drive  the  action.   Written  and  directed  by  (as  well  as  co-star  ring)  French  actress  Julie  Delpy,  the  film  fol  lows  48  hours  in  the  relationship  of  Marion,  a  French  photographer  (Delpy)  and  her  American-Jewish  boyfriend  Jack  (Adam  Goldberg,  from  The  Hebrew  Hammer).   While  Marion  and  Jack  live  together  in  New  York  City,  the  pair  make  a  stop  in  Paris  to  meet  Marion’s  family  on  the  way  back  from  a  European  holiday.   Jack,  a  character  that  tends  towards  the  Jewish  intellectual  and  hypochondriac  male  stereotype,  has  a  hard  time  relaxing.   Marion  has  a  few  challenges  of  her  own:  a  continuing  willingness  to  bend  the  truth  and  a  flirtatious  nature  that  is  guaranteed  to  make  Jack  insanely  jealous.   And  there  is  actually  a  whole  lot  to  be  jeal  ous  of,  for  this  Paris  is  not  one  of  romance  for  this  couple,  but  of  one  meeting  after  another  with  Marion’s  former  boyfriends.   As  Jack  wanders  from  one  chance  meeting  to  another  with  Marion’s  ex-lovers  (all  of  them  charming  and  preoccupied  with  sex),  she  says  with  exasperation,  “You  knew  I  was  not  a  virgin  when  I  met  you.""  Few  contempo  rary  films  have  been  able  to  plumb  the  depths  of  obsession,  jealousy  and  commit  ment  so  neatly,  while  still  being  watchable.   2  Days  in  Paris  is  exquisitely  written,  directed  and  cast.  Aside  from  the  micro  scopic  deconstruction  of  Jack  and  Marion’s  relationship,  Delpy  is  able  to  pack  in  a  daz  zling  array  of  themes.   Chief  among  them  are  the  cultural  differ  ences  and  misunderstandings  between  the  French  and  the  Americans,  so  well  delineated  with  one  clever  scene  after  another  that  I  sus  pect  that  this  film  will  play  perfectly  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic.   There  is,  of  course,  the  obligatory  nod  to  the  Jewish-gentile  relationship.  Although  Jack’s  mother  is  not  Jewish,  he  identifies  as  a  Jew  (like  Goldberg  in  real  life).  In  one  scene,  Jack,  who  doesn’t  speak  French,  comments  on  a  French  speaker  who  is  trying  to  commu  nicate  with  him.  “He’s  speaking  French,”  he  says.  “For  all  I  know,  he  said  I  killed  Christ.”   The  whiny,  complaining  and  petulant  Jack  is  no  angel:  he  readily  misleads  a  group  of  loud  Americans  looking  for  the  Louvre  so   that  he  can  grab  their  taxi,  rationalising  it  with:  “They  probably  voted  for  Bush  anyway.”   And  then  there  is  the  rest  of  the  cast.  In  a  brilliant  move,  Delpy  has  cast  her  real  par  ents  Marie  Pillet  and  Albert  Delpy  as  her  on  screen  parents  Anna  and  Jeannot.  They  both  bring  impish,  eye-twinkling  performances  to  their  respective  roles.   But  there’s  more:  in  a  moment  of  self-dis  closure,  we  learn  that  Anna  had  been  a  hippy  in  the  1960s  and  even  had  an  affair  with  the  musician  Jim  Morrison  (The  Doors),  who  is  buried  in  Paris  -  his  grave  being  one  of  Jack’s  essential  tourist  stops.   2  Days  in  Paris  will  inevitably  be  com  pared  to  Woody  Allen’s  Annie  Hall,  but  Delpy  mixes  it  up  by  wearing  Allen’s  classic  heavy  black-rimmed  glasses  and  taking  the  role  of   narrator.   While  2  Days  in  Paris  is  unlikely  to  achieve  the  iconic  status  of  its  predecessor,  Delpy  has  shown  an  astonishing  maturity  as  a  film  maker.  She  successfully  integrates  elements  of  Richard  Linklater’s  Before  Sunrise  and  Before  Sunset,  two  similarly  themed  films  she  co-starred  in  with  Ethan  Hawke,  with  a  hard  headed  look  at  intimate  relationships.   The  good  news  is  that,  as  the  summer  film  season  arrives,  adults  interested  in  serious  film  comedy  have  at  least  one  quality  film  to  see  -  and  what  a  sparkling  and  enchanting  experience  it  is.   2  Days  in  Paris  opens  nationally  on  December  26.

"  JEWISH  OUTRAGE  OVER  'OBSCENE'  HATE  DVDs     YONI  BASHAN     A  SERIES  of  DVDs  produced  in  Sydney  that  mock  Jews  as  pigs  and  preach  antisemitism  and  jihad  have  outraged  Jewish  community  lead-   ers.   The  AJN  last  week  revealed  that  the  Death  Series  and  Signs  of  the  Hour  DVDs,  which  feature  radical  cleric  Sheikh  Feiz  Muhammad,  originated  in  Sydney’s  south-west  and  were  being  distributed  on  a   worldwide  scale.   The  DVDs,  which  show  Sheikh  Feiz  referring  to  Jews  as  “pigs”  and  encouraging  children  to  take  up  holy  war  against  westerners,  sparked  widespread  condemnation,  with  the  Federal  Government  describing  them  as  reprehensible  and  offensive.   Acting  Attorney-General  Kevin  Andrews  said  the  DVDs  were  part  of  a  pattern  of  behaviour  from  sen-  ior  Islamic  clerics  which  concerned   the  government,  while  Opposition   Leader  Kevin  Rudd  described  them  as  “obscene”.   Late  last  week  Australian  Federal   Police  (AFP)  seized  copies  of  the  DVD  lectures  from  the  sheikh’s  headquarters,  the  Global  Islamic  Youth  Centre,  which  he  directs  from  Lebanon.   But  Jewish  groups  are  calling  for  action  against  1  Islam  Productions,  whose  director,  Subi  Alshaik,  claimed  he  was  unaware  of  the  hate  messages  when  the  AJN  contacted   him  last  week.   The  AFP  has  not  formally  announced  an  investigation  of  1   Islam  Productions.   Executive  Council  of  Australian   Jewry  president  Grahame  Leonard  told  the  AJN  he  was  “angry”  and  “disappointed”  to  hear  that  an  Aus-   A  screen  grab  of  Sheikh  Felz   Muhammad,  caught  on  DVD  espousing   hate.   Photo:  Sky  News     tralian  company  produced  the  hate-   ful  DVDs.   “It’s  regrettable  and  most  un-   Australian  that  these  activities  are  occurring  and  it  clearly  crosses  the  line  in  what  can  reasonably  be  con-  strued  as  free  speech.     “  It  is  to  be  hoped  that   the  full  force  of  the  law  will  be  brought  down  on  him  [Sheikh  Feiz]”   VIC  ALHADEFF   CEO,  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies     “And  if  the  sheikh  leaves  himself  open  to  prosecution  under  Aus-  tralian  federal  laws,  then  we  hope  the  AFP  will  pursue  that  action.”   Keyser  Trad,  of  the  Islamic  Friendship  Association  and  a  confi-  dante  of  controversial  mufti  Sheikh   Tajeddin  Al-Hilaly,  said  the  revela-  tions  are  an  isolated  case,  and  should  not  skew  overall  perception  of  otherwise  peaceful  Muslims.   “As  a  community,  it  is  quite  dis-  concerting  for  us  that  these  com-  ments  are  found  from  time  to  time  and  they’re  broadcast  all  over  the  news,”  he  said.   But  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  (AIJAC)  director  of  community  and  international  affairs  Jeremy  Jones  said  calling  the   new  cases  isolated  would  be  “wish-   ful  thinking”.   “It’s  a  reality  that  the  material  is  out  there,  and  has  the  potential  of  poisoning  young  minds.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  also  spoke  out  against  the  findings.   “It  is  incumbent  on  people  in  authority  to  demonstrate  responsi-  ble  leadership.  It  is  of  great  concern  when  they  abuse  their  positions  to  preach  racial  hatred.   “It  is  to  be  hoped  that  the  full  force  of  the  law  will  be  brought  down  on  him  [Sheikh  Feiz].”   NSW  Premier  Morris  Iemma  condemned  Sheikh  Feiz  last  week,  calling  on  the  Federal  Government  to  examine  his  comments  in  the  context  of  Australia’s  sedition  laws.   But  a  spokesperson  for  Federal  Attorney-General  Philip  Ruddock  told  the  AJN  that  the  government  won’t  pre-empt  AFP  investigations  with  any  charges.   “It’s  very  easy  for  people  like  Mr  Iemma  and  Mr  Rudd  to  say  some-  one  should  be  charged,  but  now  it’s  a  job  for  the  police  to  do.”  ------------------------------------------------------   ajn.com.au  -  Have  your  say,   online  poll ",2007-01-26

"  Jewish  births,  marriages  soaring  in  UK   LONDON  -  The  number  of  Jewish  births  and  marriages  in  Britain  is  soaring,  new  figures  show  -  at  a  time  when  many  had  feared  falling  birth  rates,  intermarriage  and  immigration  to  Israel  were  slowly  wiping  out  the  UK  community.   Statistics  released  by  the  Board  of  Deputies  of  British  Jews  show  that  the  number  of  Jewish  children  born  has  gone  up  by  22  per  cent,  from  2623  in  2001  to  3205  in  2005.   The  number  of  marriages  conducted  by  rabbis  also  increased  in  that  period,  from  859  in  2001  to  1000  in  2005  -  a  rise  of  16  per  cent.   The  figures,  which  are  the  latest  avail   able,  also  show  that  deaths  are  falling,  with  3610  Jewish  people  dying  in  2001  compared  to  3221  in  2005.   The  figures  are  a  surprise,  as  they  come  at  a  time  when  many  are  pre  dicting  the  end  of  the  Jewish  community  in  Britain,  only  months  after  the  commu  nity  commemorated  350  years  since  being  allowed  back  into  the  country  by   Oliver  Cromwell.   The  most  apocalyptic  of  those  visions  was  delivered  by  Rabbi  Adin  Steinsaltz  in  November  last  year,  who  -  while  on  a  visit  to  Manchester  from  his  native  Jerusalem  -  described  the  com  munity  as  “demographically  unviable”.   “It  is  a  dying  community,  without  even  counting  assimilation.  They  say  that  in  order  to  remain  stable,  a  community  needs  to  average  2.2  children.  I  don't  think  this  is  the  case  in  Anglo-Jewry,”  he   said.   Reacting  to  the  latest  figures,  how  ever,  the  Board  of  Deputies  believes  the  opposite  might  be  true.   David  Graham,  the  board's  senior  research  officer,  told  the  London  Jewish  Chronicle:  ""Cautiously  speaking,  the  decline  [in  births]  has  ceased  and  we  are  stabilising  as  a  community.’’   EUROPEAN  JEWISH  PRESS ",2007-02-23

The  pieces  will  be  displayed  as  part  of  10  Portraits  of  Jews  of  the  20th  Century,  on  show  at  Imagine  Gallery,  Double  Bay,  for  a  limited   time.   The  exhibition  features  some  of  the  great  est  Jewish  thinkers,  performers,  politicians,  and  writers  of  the  past  100  years.  Originally  shown  at  New  York’s  Jewish  Museum  in  1980,  Sydneysiders  will  be  able  to  purchase  a  piece  of  pop-art  history,  20  years  after  Warhol’s  death.  Only  200  of  the  limited-edition  prints  are  available  worldwide,  10  of  which  are  now  being  offered  in  Australia.   Gallery  director  Maureen  McCarthy  told  the  AJN  that  the  Jewish  community  has  already  shown  interest  in  the  prints.   “When  I  mention  Golda  Meir,  people  are  lit  erally  gob-smacked,”  she  says.   “Taking  an  exhibit  to  people  who  never  thought  they’d  have  a  chance  to  see  some  thing  like  this  is  really  thrilling.  The  synergy  of  Warhol's  treatment  of  these  great  figures  of  history  is  just  amazing.”   Priced  at  more  than  $600,000  for  the  10  pieces  in  total,  the  portraits  include  Sarah  Bernhardt,  Sigmund  Freud,  the  Marx  Brothers  and  George  Gershwin.   Andy  Warhol’s   screenprint  of  former  Israeli  prime  minister  Golda  Meir.   Warhol’s  combination  of  archival  photo  graphs  and  abstract  elements  of  colour  are  celebrated  by  McCarthy  as  “generating  new  depths  of  meaning  and  dialogue”.   “They’re  physically  so  beautiful,”  she  says.  “The  juxtaposition  of  a  genius  like  Freud  or   talent  like  Bernhardt  with  an  artist  of  the  stature  of  Warhol  is  just  amazing.”   10  Portraits  of  Jews  of  the  20th  Century  will  be  exhibited  at  Imagine  Gallery,  33  Cross  Street,  Double   Bay.

"  Local  author  wins  Jewish  book  prize   DEBORAH  STONE   SYDNEY  author  Marcus  Zusak  (pictured)  has  won  an  award  for  the  best  Jewish-themed  young  adult  book  in  the  US  National  Jewish  Book  awards.   The  Book  Thief  was  named  the  best  chil-   dren’s  or  young  adult  book  by  the  Jewish  Book  Council.   Set  during  World  War  II  in  Germany,  The  Book  Thief  is  the  story  of  a  young  girl  fostered  in  an  unsympa-  thetic  family  in  a  small  town.  As  the  child  learns  to  read  and  becomes  obsessed  by  books,  she  also   learns  to  understand  the  adults  around  her,  including  the  Jewish  man  hidden  in  her  basement.   Zusak,  who  is  not  Jewish,  is  Australian  but  his  moth-  er  grew  up  in  a  small  German  town  similar  to  the  one   described  in  his  novel.   “We  have  these  images  of  the  straight-marching  lines  of  boys  and  the  ‘heil  Hitlers’  and  this  idea  that  everyone  in  Germany  was  in  it  together.   ""But  there  still  were  rebellious  children  and  people  who  didn’t  follow  the  rules  and  people  who  hid  Jews  and  other  people  in  their  houses.  So  there’s  another  side  to  Nazi  Germany,""  he  said.   In  2006,  Zusak  was  a  presenter  at  the  inaugural  Syd-  ney  Jewish  Writers'  Festival. ",2007-02-02

"  ‘HOT’  JEWISH  ART  A  HOT  TOPIC   CANBERRA  -  The  fate  of  Jewish-owned  artworks   that  were  either  stolen  or  forcibly  sold  in  the  Netherlands  during  the  Holocaust  was  the  topic  at  the  latest  meeting  of  the  Australian  Jewish  His  torical  Society  of  the  ACT.   Dutch  Ambassador  to  Australia  Nick  van  Zut  phen  addressed  the  meeting  in  Canberra  last  Monday.  A  lawyer  by  training,  he  recounted  the  difficulties  in  reclaiming  artworks,  both  from  pri  vate  owners  and  from  public  museums,  and  the  ethical  dilemma  posed  as  these  works  disap  peared  from  public  view.   His  talk  comes  at  the  same  time  that  Chilean  Juan  Carlos  Emden  is  staking  a  claim  against  the  National  Gallery  of  Victoria  for  a  1913  painting,  Lady  with  a  fan,  by  Dutchman  Gerard  ter  Borch.  Emden  believes  his  father  was  forced  to  sell  the   painting  for  a  tiny  price  before  fleeing  Germany  in  1934.  Ambassador  van  Zutphen  has  a  strong  connection  with  the  Jewish  community.  His  par  ents  were  honoured  as  Righteous  Among  the  Nations  for  hiding  Jews  during  the  Holocaust  and  his  wife’s  Jewish  father  was  himself  involved  in  reclaiming  Dutch  artworks  from  Germany  after   the  war.

"  Jewish  soccer  teams  in  field  brawl   AJN  STAFF   FOUR  players  were  sent  from  the  field  after  a  brawl  that  included  spec  tators  and  managers  broke  out  between  two  Jewish  teams  during  a  football  match  at  Dave  Phillips  Field  on  Sunday.   The  Eastern  Suburbs  Football  Fed   eration  (ESFA)  all-aged  division-six  match  between  Maccabi  and  a  largely  Jewish  University  of  New  South  Wales  (UNSW)  team  erupted  into  a  fight  in   the  last  five  minutes  after  a  controver  sial  tackle  from  a  throw-in.   Opinions  of  what  sparked  the  fra  cas  are  divided  depending  on  the  clubs  involved,  but  according  to  a  Maccabi  player,  who  spoke  to  the  AJN  on  condition  on  anonymity,  a  UNSW  player  fell  to  the  ground  following  a  tackle  and  the  UNSW  players  over  reacted  and  punched  the  tackier.   “I  was  punched...  I  retaliated  with  a  push  and  then  several  Maccabi  and  UNSW  players  became  involved  in   the  argument,  with  several  players  pushing  each  other,”  the  player  said.   But  a  UNSW  player  who  was  on  the  field  disagreed,  telling  the  AJN  the  fight  only  began  because  the  Mac  cabi  player  overreacted  to  a  push.  “I  believe  the  UNSW  players  only  ran  in   to  defend  their  team-mate  after  the  situation  became  out  of  control.”   Several  players  are  expected  to  face  the  ESFA  judiciary  on  Tuesday  night.   For  the  record,  UNSW  won  the  match,  3-2.   Meanwhile,  the  headmaster  of  the  school  whose  students  were  involved   in  an  antisemitic  incident  during  a  soccer  match  against  Masada  College  has  vowed  to  root  out  the  offenders.   Davidson  High  School  head  Rod  erick  Cawsey  told  the  AJN  this  week  that  investigations  into  the  March  30  incident  had  stalled  over  the  school  holidays,  but  would  resume  next  week.   Last  month’s  inter-school  match   turned  ugly  after  Davidson  support  ers  allegedly  shouted,  “f***cking   Jews”  and  “heil  Hitler”  at  the  Masada  players,  while  giving  Nazi  salutes.   Masada  principal  Wendy  Barel  said  she  spoke  to  Cawsey  following  last  week’s  AJN  report  about  the  flare-up.   “He  feels  very  confident  that  he  can  identify  the  students.  I  presume  he’ll  interview  enough  students  to  find  out  [who  they  were],  or  someone  will  own  up.”   Last  week,  Cawsey  told  the  AJN  that  once  found,  the  guilty  parties   would  undertake  Holocaust-educa  tion  initiatives.   “I’m  very  moved  by  circumstances  around  the  world  at  the  present  time,”  he  said.   “I  have  had  good  discussions  with  Wendy  [Barel]  about  it  and  we’re  at   one  on  the  issue.”   Barel,  for  her  part,  played  down  the  need  for  harsher  punishment.   “It  would  be  helpful  for  the  students  themselves  if  they’re  identified  and  spoken  with  ...  they  can’t  escape  the  reality  of  what  they  did,”  Barel  said.

"  ‘Jewish  scandal’  rocks  UK  Labour  Party   BERNARD  JOSEPHS   LONDON  -  Fears  are  growing  of  an  anti  Semitic  backlash  following  the  latest  Labour  Party  cash  scandal  involving  two  prominent  Jewish  activists.   Communal  leaders  expressed  con  cern  that  the  situation  may  mirror  the  cash-for-peerages  affair,  in  which,  after  a  long  criminal  investigation,  Labour  fundraiser  Lord  Levy  faced  no  charges.   The  two  main  figures  in  the  latest  controversy  are  Jon  Mendelsohn,  the  prime  minister’s  election  campaign  fundraiser,  and  property  magnate  David  Abrahams,  who  is  accused  of  breaking  the  law  by  using  third  parties  to  disguise  donations  of  over  £600,000  to  the  Labour  Party.   Mendelsohn,  an  ex-chairman  of  Labour  Friends  of  Israel,  wrote  to  Abrahams,  a  member  of  the  Jewish   The  funding  scandal  in  the  UK  Labour   Party  Involving  property  magnate  David  Abrahams  could  have  repercussions  for  British  Prime  Minister  Gordon  Brown.   Labour  Movement,  last  Thursday,  thanking  him  for  his  “help  and  support  over  many  years”  and  offering  to  tell   him  of  Labour’s  future  plans.  MPs  questioned  whether  he  knew  about  Abrahams’  methods,  which  break  the  law  on  political  donations.   But  the  furore  had  a  “whiff  of  anti  Semitism  about  it”,  said  Labour  MP  Andrew  Dismore.  “People  are  looking  for  links  to  Jewish  interests  and  evi  dence  of  a  Jewish  conspiracy.  The  press  are  turning  every  stone  to  find  one.”   The  Hendon  MP  said  he  did  not  believe  the  case  would  have  received   such  intensive  coverage  “if  it  did  not  involve  Jews.  The  undercurrent  of  anti-Semitism  is  worrying.”  Jewish  Leadership  Council  member  Brian   Kemer  said:  “I  am  sure  the  whole  affair  will  have  an  effect  on  the  com   munity”  Describing  Abrahams  as  a  “good  guy”,  he  warned:  “It  has  an   added  effect  of  anti-Semitism  -  it   won’t  do  us  any  good.”   Paul  Usiskin,  Labour  supporter  and  co-chair  of  Peace  Now  UK,  said:  “It  doesn’t  do  the  reputation  of  people  communally  linked  to  Israel  any  good  to  find  themselves  willingly  or  unwill  ingly  at  the  centre  of  matters  to  do  with  politics  and  money.  I  hope  that,  in  con  trast  to  previous  issues  of  this  kind,  people  do  not  link  historical  relations  between  Jews  and  financial  affairs.”   Mill  Hill  Rabbi  Yitzchak  Schochet,  who  earlier  claimed  that  his  congre  gant,  Lord  Levy,  was  “hung  out  to  dry”  by  the  media,  said  he  would  hesitate  to  draw  a  parallel  between  the  two  events,  not  least  because  “Lord  Levy  had  done  nothing  wrong,  while  in  this  case  something  wrong  had  been  done  by  all  accounts,  and  admitted  by  everyone  indudine  the  prime  minister”.

"  JUSTICE  STEPHEN  ROTHMAN  AM   Judge  courts  award  to  Jewish  community   NSW  Supreme  Court  Justice  Stephen  Rothman  believes  his  Order  of  Aus  tralia  (AM)  belongs  to  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  of  which  he  is  immediate  past  president,  and  to  the  Jewish  community.   “I’m  grateful  to  have  received  it  but  I  think  it’s  more  a  recognition  of  the  board  and  the  leadership  of  the  Jewish  community  than  of  me  per  sonally”   Reflecting  this  week  on  his  Aus  tralia  Day  honour,  Justice  Rothman  says  his  period  at  the  helm  of  the  board  from  2000-04  “was  a  particu  larly  difficult  time  because  of  the  intifada  and  the  escalation  of  physical  threats  to  the  community”.   He  sees  the  “total  reorganisation”  of  the  NSW  Communal  Security  Group  (CSG)  in  response  to  the   threats  as  a  key  achievement  of  his  presidency.   Also  rated  highly  were  the  Federal  Court  of  Australia’s  findings  against   Holocaust-deniers  Dr  Fredrick  Toben  and  Olga  Scully  in  2002,  as  the  result  of  cases  he  conceived,  which  he  describes  as  the  first  in  the  world  “that  defined  Holocaust  denial  as  racial  vil  ification”.   The  development  of  the  Abraham  Conference,  which  brings  together  Jews,  Christians  and  Muslims  in  a   forum,  is  yet  another  highlight,  he  says.   Similarly,  the  board’s  provision  of  a  scholarship  for  indigenous  students  at  the  University  of  Technology,  Sydney  ""will  have  an  enduring  effect”.   Justice  Rothman,  who  has  been  governor  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Com  munal  Appeal  (JCA)  since  1993,  says   Stephen  Rothman   speaking  at  a  pro-Israel  rally  at  the  height  of   the  Intifada  In  2002.

In  Perth,  for  example,  you’d  need  to  include  the  shuls,  which  aren’t  a  part  of  the  JCA  here  in  Sydney,  and  in  Melbourne,  theirs  is  a  different  history  but  they  need  to  look  at  coordinating  their   fundraising.”  A  barrister  since  1982  and  a  senior  counsel  since  1995,  Jus  tice  Rothman,  55,  was  appointed  to  the  NSW  Supreme  Court  bench  in  2005.

"  An  Australian  Jew  inside  the  ‘powerful  Jewish  lobby’   VIEWPOINT!   V1CALHADEFF   Attending  the  annual   conference  of  AIPAC  in   Washington,  one  is  impressed  with  its  scope  and  influence  -  and  with  the  respect   accorded  to  Australia.   I  Middleweight  it  may  be,   but  our  government  is  highly  regarded  for  its  consistent  position  on  Israel.   LAST  week,  I  got  to  lobby  Capitol   Hill.  An  experience  bordering  on  the  surreal,  it  was  a  rare  glimpse  into  the  workings  of  one  of  America’s   seats  or  power.   More  to  the  point,  it  provided  an  opportunity  to  experience  first-hand  how  they  -  the  American  Jewish  lobby   -  do  it.   Make  no  mistake  about  it  -  it’s  impressive.  Enormously  impressive.  It’s  open,  it’s  entirely  above  board,  it’s  legitimate,  it’s  what  one  does  in  a  healthy,  robust  democracy.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  vice-president  Yair  Miller  and  I  attended  the  annual  American  Israel  Public  Affairs  Committee  (AIPAC)  conference  in  Washington  DC.   With  100,000  members  across  the  United  States,  AIPAC’s  raison  d’etre  is  to  enhance  the  US-Israel  relationship.   An  American  take  on  politicians  “pandering”  to  Jewish  votes.  (Ralph  Nader  Is  the  perennial  “Independent”  candidate  for  the  presidency.)   It  is  consistently  ranked  by  mem  bers  of  Congress  -  who  better  to  judge?  -  as  among  the  top-five  most  effective  lobbying  organisations  in  Washington.   The  conference  attracted  a  stag  gering  6200  delegates  -  academics,  business  leaders,  millionaires,  1200  students,  European  and  Canadian  MPs,  a  Christian  evangelist  who  speaks  to  99  million  TV  viewers  weekly,  and  ambassadors  representing  countries  ranging  from-Azerbaijan^  Liechtenstein  and  Jordan  to  Namibia,  Slovenia  and  Mongolia.   Israel’s  delegation  included  former  prime  minister  Binyamin  Netanyahu,  Defence  Minister  Amir  Peretz,  Foreign  Minister  Tzipi  Livni  and  Ambassador  to  the  UN  Dan  Gillerman.   And  the  participation  by  America’s  political  leadership  was  nothing  short  of  remarkable.   Speakers  included  Vice-President  Dick  Cheney,  who  dwelt  on  the  symbi  otic  relationship  between  Israel  and  Washington;  Anita  Loewy,  chair  of  the  House  Appropriations  Subcommittee,  where  foreign  aid  is  decided,  who  said  she  put  a  hold  on  $US86  million  for  the  Palestinian  territories  “until  I  got  adequate  answers  to  how  the  money  was  to  be  spent”;  and  the  four  most  powerful  identities  on  Capitol  Hill.   Foremost  among  these  was  Speaker  of  the  House  Nancy  Pelosi,   who  described  the  US  commitment  to  Israel’s  security  as  unshakeable,  pointed  out  that  her  grandchildren  attend  synagogue,  and  said  she  keeps  copies  of  the  ID  tags  of  the  three  abducted  Israeli  soldiers  in  her  office  as  a  reminder  of  her  determination  to  work  for  their  release.   Presidential  candidates  Hillary   Clinton  and  Barack  Obama  led  a  slew   of  senators  who  addressed  delegates.   And  about  220  congressmen  and   women  and  50  senators  -  more  than  half  of  Congress  -  attended  the  final  banquet,  prominent  among  them  Joe  Lieberman,  Jesse-  Jackson,  Joe  Biden  and  Tom  Lantos.   The  Australian  presence  was  appreciated  -  as  much  for  Prime  Min  ister  John  Howard’s  well-known  sup  port  for  Israel  as  for  the  fact  that  we  had  travelled  halfway  around  the  globe  to  be  there.   In  fact,  applause  erupted  on  one  occasion  when  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  vice-president  introduced  himself  during  question  time  at  one   session.   Each  speaker  who  took  to  the  podium  welcomed  the  feet  that  all  6200  delegates  would  be  heading  to  Capitol  Hill  to  lobby  their  congres  sional  representatives  on  three  pressing  issues:   •  A  resolution  before  Congress  on  the  need  to  legislate  divestment  from  Iran  (US  pension  funds  invest  hun  dreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in  that  country);   9   •  The  impending  debate  on  US  for  eign  aid,  with  Israel’s  needs  upper  most;  and   •  The  feet  that  the  Hamas-Fatah  coalition  has  enabled  Hamas  to  claim   legitimacy  without  having  renounced  terrorism  or  recognised  Israel.   Which  is  how  I  found  myself  on  Capitol  Hill  —  part  of  a  delegation  that  was  to  lobby  Republican  Washington  Congressman  Doc  Hastings.   Within  minutes  of  us  taking  our  seats  in  his  office,  the  leader  of  the  AIPAC  group  unexpectedly  invited  me  to  lead  the  discussion  on  Iran.   So  I  did,  explaining  the  need  to  iso  late  Iran.economically'and  politically,  to  deter  it  from  pursuing  a  nuclear  option  that  threatens  not  just  Israel,  but  the  West.  An  Australian  from  Sydney  on  Capitol  Hill.   Away  from  the  hype  of  the  confer  ence,  the  remarkable  calibre  of  partic  ipants  and  the  motley  gathering  of  placard-waving  Chassidic,  anti-Israel  protesters  across  the  street,  it  was  clear  that  Australia  is  regarded  as  a  player,  both  politically  and  Jewishly.   Middleweight  it  may  be,  but  our  government  is  highly  regarded  for  its  consistent  position  on  Israel,  often  in  the  face  of  a  majority  of  opposing  opinion  in  international  forums.   And  so  is  the  Australian  Jewish  community,  which,  despite  its  rela  tively-small  size,  has  acquired  a  repu  tation  as  strong,  proactive  and  effective.  We  were  proud  to  represent  both  Australia  and  Australian  Jewry.   Vic  Alhadeff  is  chief  executive  officer  of   the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies. ",2007-03-30
"  LEX1  LANDSMAN   ART  can  be  a  tool  to  reminisce  and  reflect  on  memory.  This  is  what  two  Jewish  artists  have  shown  in  the  upcoming  exhibition  of  their  work,  which  represents  their  different  experiences  as  Jews  in  exile.   Perl  Contemporary  Art  (PCA)  gallery  in  Vaucluse  will  open  Memory  and  Exile  next  week,  which  will  feature  art  by  Theo  Tobiasse  and  Sydneysider  Michael  Vaynman.   Proceeds  from  the  art  sale  will  be  donated   to  Magen  David  Adorn,  which  is  a  national  emergency  medical  service  in  Israel.   For  Michael  Vaynman,  who  spent  his  early  years  in  exile,  sculpture  has  served  as  a  means  to  experiment  with  form  and  reflect  on  his  life  experiences.  Born  in  St  Petersburg,  Russia,  Vaynman  migrated  to  Sydney  in  1982  with  his  mother,  Larissa  Smagarinsky.   His  mother  became  a  well-known  sculp  tress  and,  when  Vaynman  graduated  with  a  diploma  in  fine  art  from  Western  University,  he  quickly  began  to  follow  in  her  footsteps.   “I  create  sculpture  that  explores  forms  and  traditional  themes,”  he  said.  “My  interest  is  in  the  synthesis  of  geometric  forms  with  organic  shapes,  such  as  the   .  ■  :   '  iSgMikl   :  ""  ;  X/:  !   wm   WBf^   WmWnesleteim   ^aJewtet.tamlljr  ■  ■■  lanMnghfesaolIrpmv  '   Eastern  Europe.   human  figure.  The  main  intention  of  my  art  is  to  bring  quiet  contemplation  to  the  mind  and  involve  [viewers]  in  the  aesthetic  experience.”   While  Vaynman’s  art  has  been  influenced  by  the  migrant  experience  and  his  family’s  lineage,  Tobiasse’s  art  is  directly  reflective  of  his  experiences  as  a  Jew  in  exile.   Tobiasse  was  bom  in  Palestine  in  1927  and  later  moved  to  Lithuania,  and  then  set  tled  in  Paris  in  1933.   During  the  Holocaust,  he  spent  two  years  in  hiding  in  a  Paris  apartment.  It  was  there  that  Tobiasse  developed  his  interest  and  skills  in  drawing.

"  Circumcision  is  the  most  basic  rite  of  passage  for  a  Jewish  male.  But  are  uncircumcised  Jewish   males  any  less  Jewish?   KALEIDOSCOPE   JULIE  SZEGO   FRIENDS  of  mine  arranged  a   somewhat  unconventional  cir  cumcision  for  their  baby  son  recently.  When  he  was  about  two  weeks  old,  they  deposited  him  with  a  doctor,  who  did  the  deed  with  barely  a  nod  to  religious  ritual  and  with  none  of  the  baby’s  relatives  bearing  witness.  “Yeah,  we  finally  did  it,”  the  baby’s  father  told  me,  “but  we  weren’t  going  to  say  no  blessing  on  the  schmeckel.”   I  wondered  how  a  Jewish  couple  could  find  meaning  in  circumcising  their  son  when  they  strip  the  event  of  ancient  ritual  and  family  involve  ment.  But  I  understood  that  this  was   a  response  to  their  profound  ambiva   lence  toward  the  tradition.   OK,  is  there  any  bigger  taboo,  even  among  secular  Jews,  than  question  ing  the  necessity  of  circumcision?  I  don’t  believe  there  is,  and  I’m  not  about  to  start.  In  fact,  I  made  it  clear  to  my  non-Jewish  partner  that  if  we  were  to  have  a  boy,  the  snip  was  not  negotiable.  Yes,  I  muttered  about  the  medical  and  other  benefits  (sheep   ishly  aware  that  circumcision’s  oppo  nents  could  counter  each  one).  But,  in  truth,  mine  was  a  visceral  position,  beyond  reason.  “It  is  part  of  the   covenant  between  God  and  Abra  ham,”  said  this  committed  agnostic,  with  only  a  drop  of  irony.   But  I  dip  my  toe  into  this  hot  topic  because  circumcision  does  clash  with  modem  sensibilities,  and  some  Jews  rebelling  against  tradition  and  deny  ing  this  is  happening  won’t  stop  it  from  happening.  And  this  leaves  the  question  of  how  we  respond  to  the   dissenters.   A  few  years  ago,  ethicist  Leslie  Cannold  wrote  a  piece  in  The  Age  explaining  her  decision  not  to  have   her  son  circumcised.  Cannold  made  it  clear  that  she  wanted  to  bequeath  her  son  a  strong  sense  of  Jewish  iden  tity,  but  each  time  she  imagined  a  doctor  or  mohel  moving  towards  her  baby  to  make  the  cut,  she  baulked.  “There  were  reasons  for  and  against,  but  in  the  end  it  came  down  to  the  small  voice  in  my  head  that  kept  say  ing  ‘no’,”  she  wrote.   I  remember  feeling  both  shocked  and  delighted  at  the  piece:  shocked   because  I  had  never  heard  of  a  Jew   refusing  to  circumcise,  and  delighted  because  the  piece  was  moving  and  gentle,  and  proved,  yet  again,  how  resilient  and  mysterious  we  are  as  a   people.  Since  then,  I  have  heard  many  mothers  confess  their  lonely  anguish  at  having  to  submit  their  precious  newborn  to  intense,  albeit  fleeting,  pain.  They  felt  as  if  they  had  breached   the  trust  of  one  so  vulnerable.  Is  there  room,  within  the  religious  context,  to  acknowledge  their  distress?  Maybe  one  way  of  ensuring  the  custom  endures  is  to  allow  discussion  of  the  powerful,  sometimes  negative,  emo   tions  it  can  evoke.   Is  there  any  bigger   taboo,  even  among  secular  Jews,  than  questioning  the  necessity  of   circumcision?   Google  Jews  and  circumcision  and  you’ll  uncover  many  a  website  dedicated  to  Jews  opposing  circumci  sion.  You  can  read  all  about  the  New   Age  Californian  rabbis  who’ve   devised  ceremonial  alternatives  to  the  brit,  and  so  on.   A  woman  passes  Jewish  inheri  tance  through  her  womb.  The  same  inheritance  does  not  pass  through  the  man’s  seed.  Maybe  this  is  why  we  insist  he  be  permanently  marked;  to  remind  him  of  his  inherited  contrac  tual  duty  to  the  Israelites  and  their   God.  cut  does  it  necessarily  tonow  that  the  unmarked  man  has  vowed  to  forget?   My  own  father  is  uncircumcised  -  a  fact  disclosed  in  his  published  mem  oirs  -  because  my  Hungarian  grandfa   ther  had  converted  to  Catholicism  in   order  to  keep  the  family’s  fortunes  good  in  an  era  of  rising  antisemitism.  And  yet,  his  conforming  penis  didn’t  save  him  from  getting  bashed  by  anti  semites  at  boarding  school  or  depor  tation  to  Auschwitz.  To  suggest  my  father  is  any  less  a  Jew  because  of  an  extra  sliver  of  skin  is  an  obscenity.  To  suggest  the  California  uncut  brigade,  with  their  alternative  brits,  aren’t  fair  dinkum  Jews  is,  to  my  mind,  no  less  of  one.  The  do-it-yourself  improvisation  of  tradition  might  be  conceited  -  but   this  earnest  and  ridiculous  over-com   pensation  is  proof  of  their  commit  ment  They  have  not  cut  themselves   off  from  the  tribe.   Let  the  rabbis  say  what  they  will  -  and  by  this  I  intend  no  disrespect.  The  rest  of  us  should  never  get  to  the  point  of  pulling  down  trousers  to  take  the  measure  of  a  Jew,  in  a  crude  imitation  of  centuries  of  Jew-haters.  Sometimes  the  mark  of  a  Jew  is  an  invisible  one,  and  it’s  planted  firmly   in  the  heart.   Julie  Szego  is  a  writer  for  The  Age.   Her  column  appeals  monthly. ",2007-10-05
"  JEWISH  EX-MAYOR  TIPPED   TO  TAKE  ON  MICHAEL  DANBY     JASON  FRENKEL     A  JEWISH  former  mayor  is  consid-  ered  the  frontrun-  ner  in  the  Liberals’  bid  to  unseat  Labor  MP  for  Mel-  bourne  Ports   Michael  Danby  (pictured)  in  this  year’s  federal  election.   Lawyer  Adam  Held,  who  served  as  mayor  of  Stonnington  from  1997-  98,  is  believed  to  have  the  support  of  key  party  officials  to  run  against  par-  liament’s  only  Jewish  MP  in  the  elec-  torate  of  Melbourne  Ports.   But  the  man  who  lost  to  Danby  in  the  2004  poll,  David  Southwick,  is  considering  a  rematch,  barely  two  months  after  narrowly  missing  out  on  a  seat  in  the  Victorian  Upper  House.   Southwick  told  the  AJN  this  week  he  had  yet  to  make  up  his  mind  on  whether  he  would  run  for  Mel-  bourne  Ports  again,  with  applica-  tions  for  Liberal  Party  preselection  set  to  dose  on  January  31.   Several  senior  Liberal  sources  said   Southwick  was  highly  regarded  by  party  officials  after  he  slashed  Danby's  margin  in  2004,  giving  the  coalition  a  chance  of  winning  Mel-  bourne  Ports  for  the  first  time  since  federation.   With  the  Liberals  needing  a  swing  of  just  3.6  per  cent  to  take  the  seat,  the  campaign  is  likely  to  attract  top  level  funding  and  support  from  party  headquarters.   But  Southwick’s  2004  campaign  impressed  enough  people  that  he  may &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   be  given  a  chance  at  a  safer  seat,  either  this  year  or  at  the  next  federal  poll.   “He’s  very  well-known  in  the  Jew-  ish  community,  but  there  is  a  feeling  he  should  get  something  better,”  one   Liberal  source  said.   Held,  a  Stonnington  councillor  between  1997-99  who  runs  a  law  practice  in  Malvern,  would  not  com-  ment  on  his  possible  candidacy.   It  is  understood  that  state  MP   Helen  Shardey  is  among  those  back-  ing  a  possible  Held  nomination.   Melbourne  Ports,  which  includes  Caulfield  and  St  Kilda,  is  the  federal  electorate  with  the  largest  Jewish  population,  ahead  of  Wentworth  in  Sydney.   Frank  Greenstein,  who  works  in   Shardey's  office,  has  also  been  sug-  gested  as  a  potential  candidate,  but  the  AJN  understands  he  won’t  be  contesting.   Southwick  said  he  would  be  a  key  player  in  the  Melbourne  Ports  cam-  paign  -  but  remains  undecided  on  his  role.   “At  this  stage  I’m  just  not  sure  exactly  what  I’m  going  to  do,”  he  said.

Photo:  AJN  file   Baby  boomers  herald  Jewish  aged-care  crisis   MELISSA  SINGER   A  MASSIVE  increase  in  the   number  of  middle-aged  Aus  tralian  Jews  is  heralding  an  aged-care  crisis  for  the  com  munity,  according  to  the  latest   census  data.   The  results  of  the  2006  census  released  last  week  reveal  that  the  number  of  Australian  Jews  aged  55-64  has  increased  to  12,071,  up  from  6397  in  1996.   Emmy  Monash  Home  for  the  Aged  CEO  Benita   Berelovitch  said  the  commu   nity  must  assess  the  number  of  baby  boomers  who  are  likely  to  seek  Jewish  aged-care  services.   “[Baby  boomers]  will  be  looking  for  quality  aged  cure,  but  not  necessarily  Jewish  aged-care.   “The  previous  generation  were  mainly  immigrants  and   Holocaust  survivors.  At  the  end  of  their  lives,  they  felt  it  is  more  important  to  be  around  ‘their  people’.”   Despite  the  looming  flood  of  Jews  into  the  aged  care  market  in  the  next  15-20   years,  Berelovitch  dismissed  any  plans  for  Emmy  Monash  to  expand.  She  said  the  aver  age  life  expectancy  of  its  high   care  residents  is  18  months  from  the  time  of  admission.   Robert  Orie,  CEO  of  Mon  tefiore  Homes  for  the  Aged  in  Sydney,  said  the  increased  rate  of  diagnosis  of  dementia  and   Alzheimer’s  -  around  five  new  cases  in  the  Jewish  com  munity  and  1000  cases  in  the  wider  community  each  week  -  would  also  place  future  strain  on  Jewish  aged  care  provision.   Montefiore,  which  will  stage  a  capital  appeal  through  the  Jewish  Communal  Appeal  later  this  year,  currently  has  700  beds,  but  Orie  said  there  is  room  to  expand  its  state-of  the-art  Randwick  facility  by  an  extra  120  beds  as  demand  increases.   Jewish  Care  (Victoria)  CEO  Bruce  Salvin  said  that  on   the  upside,  the  increase  in  Jewish  population  at  this  cen  sus  -  up  from  83,993  to  88,832  -  would  attract  more  govern  ment  funding  for  aged  care.   But  Jewish  Care  still  relies  on  $3  million  in  private  dona  tions  each  year  to  operate,  and  the  $1.2  million  it  receives  from  the  Claims  Conference   each  year  would  also  soon  dry  up  as  the  Holocaust  survivor  generation  dies  out,  he  said.   Salvin  said  that  900  beds  would  be  needed  by  2011  to  accommodate  the  growing  needs  of  the  Jewish  commu  nity.  Currently,  it  has  520  between  Jewish  Care  and  Emmy  Monash.   Rather  than  build  demen   tia-specific  units  such  as  Ash  wood,  which  it  plans  to  close  at  the  end  of  2008,  Jewish  Care  would  focus  on  “flexible  services  responses”  to  cater  to  a  variety  of  needs,  he  said.

"  An  Aussie  Jgw  i   small-town  Wales   On  a  recent  visit  to  Wales,   FRANCES  SILVER  encountered  a  Jewish  Aussie  in  the  unlikeliest  of  places.   WHAT  would  make  a  young  Aussie   move  to  a  remote  town  in  Wales   and  live  there  for  15  years?   Mark  Grinszpan,  a  41-year-old  Jewish  ex  pat  now  living  in  Aberaeron,  Wales,  has  an  interesting  family  background.   His  parents  Maurice  and  Olga  survived  the  Holocaust  as  children  in  Poland,  before  mov  ing  to  Australia,  where  they  married.   They  established  the  Rossy  Knitting  Mills,  which  is  still  operating  in  Melbourne’s  south  eastern  suburbs,  48  years  later.   Mark,  one  of  three  siblings,  met  his  wife  Carol,  a  26-year-old  nurse  from  Wales,  at  the  age  of  21.  The  pair  married  and  left  Australia  for  Aberaeron,  Wales.   Aberaeron  has  a  population  of  2000  and  is  located  south  of  Cardiff  along  the  coastline.  This  charming  and  picturesque  seaside  town   Mark  Grinszpan...  still  calls  Australia  home.   jumps  straight  out  of  the  pages  of  the  Brothers  Grimm  fairytales.   It  was  founded  200  years  ago,  with  its  main  architecture  being  Georgian.  The  town  is  home  to  eight  pubs,  one  hospital,  several  cafes  and  shops.   When  Mark,  a  cheerful  laid-back  Australian  moved  into  town,  Aberaeron  was  caught  in  the  grips  of  Australia  fever.   In  a  short  space  of  time,  Mark  became  a   popular  figure  around  town  -  to  most  in  Aberaeron,  he’s  affectionately  known  as   “Aussie  Mark”.   Mark  and  Carol  have  lived  in  the  same  house  for  15  years  with  their  two  sons,  David,  14,  and  John,  11.   Over  the  years,  the  family  has  become  very  active  in  the  sporting  community.  Mark  captains  the  senior  cricket  team  and  coaches  the  junior  team,  while  David  is  captain  of  the  school’s  rugby  team.   Describing  himself  as  an  atheist,  Mark  says  that  “the  only  thing  important  to  me  is  to  treat  people  the  same  as  I  would  like  to  be  treated”.   He  still  misses  Melbourne  and  often  com  municates  with  his  family.  It  was  only  recently  that  Mark  brought  his  children  over  for  a  reunion  with  family  and  friends  in   Australia.   On  his  kitchen  wall  hangs  a  large  blow-up  photograph  of  the  Melbourne  city  skyline.  “You  see,”  he  beams,  “I  still  call  Australia   home.”   Frances  Silver  is  a  journalism  student  at  TAFE,   St  George,  in  Sydney.

"  AUSTRALIAN  CENSUS   Healthy  rise  in   Jewish  population   JASON  FRENKEL   AUSTRALIA’S  Jewish  population  con  tinues  to  grow  at  the  same  rate  as  the  general  population,  according  to  the  national  Census  figures  released  by  the   Australian  Bureau  of  Statistics  this  week.   Official  2006  Census  figures  released  this  week  show  88,801  people  nominated  Judaism  as  their  faith,  but  the  actual  figure  is  estimated  to  be  about  15-20  per  cent  higher  than  recorded  in  the  data,  which  would  confirm  the  long-held  view  of  Jewish  leaders  that  Australia  now  has  closer  to  120,000  Jews.   Acting  president  of  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  Anton  Block  said  the  population  data  seemed  consistent  with  Jewish  community   estimates.   He  said  there  was  anecdotal  evi   dence  that  the  actual  Jewish  popula  tion  could  even  be  higher  than  120,000,  although  it  was  difficult  to  estimate  just  how  many  Jewish  people  left  the  religion  question  blank  on  their   Census  forms.   “That’s  been  the  number  -120,000  -  for  years,  so  it  could  be  even  higher  than  that,”  he  said.   “We  can  understand  the  reasons   why  some  people  might  not  answer  that  question,  but  it  does  affect  the   final  count”   The  estimated  Australian  popula  tion  of  20.7  million  -  the  official  figure  is  19,855,289  but  doesn’t  account  for  Australians  overseas  and  those  who   were  not  counted  -  represents  a   growth  of  around  five  per  cent  from  the  2001  estimate  of  19.4  million,  which  is  roughly  equivalent  to  the  percentage  growth  in  the  Jewish  community.   The  figures  again  confirm  Mel  bourne  as  the  capital  of  Jewish  Aus  tralia,  with  about  46  per  cent  of  Australian  Jews  calling  the  city  home.   The  figures  show41,105  Jews  live  in  Victoria,  while  36,716  reside  in  New  South  Wales.  At  the  other  end,  Tasma  nia,  with  167  Jews,  and  the  Northern  Territory,  which  has  120,  have  the   smallest  communities  in  Australia.   But  while  the  size  of  the  Australian   Jewry  has  increased  by  11  per  cent  dur  ing  the  past  decade  -  there  were  slightly  fewer  than  80,000  Jews  accord  ing  to  the  1996  Census  -  Judaism’s   slice  of  the  national  share  remained   steady  at  0.4  per  cent  of  the  total  population.  CONTINUED  ON  NEWS  3   CONTINUED  FilOSVl  NEWS  1   In  contrast,  Muslims  make  up  almost  two  per  cent  of  the  national  population,  with  about  340,000  people  nominating  Islam   as  their  faith.   Nearly  half  of  Australia's  Muslims  live  in  Sydney,  where  they  comprise  almost  four  per  cent  of  that  city’s  population.   The  number  of  Muslims  has  increased  by  about  70  per  cent  in  the  past  10   years,  but  the  2006  figures  show  Hin  duism  and  Buddhism  were  the  fastest  growing  religions  among  the  major  faiths.   More  than  one-in-five  Australians  were  born  overseas,  and  while  2.1  million  Aus  tralians  hail  from  Europe,  the  largest  pro  portion  (27  per  cent)  of  recent  arrivals  were  born  in  Asia.   In  addition,  about  18,000  Iraqis  and  Afghanis  have  arrived  on  Australian  soil  since  2001,  many  of  them  war  refugees   fleeing  conflict  and  political  unrest  in   those  countries.   About  one  per  cent  of  Australians  claim  Lebanese  ancestry,  with  about  74,000  people  born  in  Lebanon  now  calling  Australia  home.

"  Jewish  community  welcomes  new  NSW  Opposition  leader   YuNI  BASHAN   SENIOR  Jewish  community  figures  in  NSW  have  embraced  the  ascent  of  Barry  O’Farrell  to  the  State  Opposi  tion  leadership,  following  Peter  Deb  nam’s  sudden  resignation  on  Monday.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  said  O’Farrell  had   shown  “tremendous  support”  to  the  Jewish  community  in  the  past.   “The  Jewish  community  and  the  Board  of  Deputies  have  an  excellent  relationship  both  with  Mr  Debnam  and  Mr  O’Farrell,  and  we  have  every  confidence  that  will  continue,”  he  told  the  AJN.   State  Zionist  Council  of  NSW   president  Frank  Levy  also  welcomed  O’Farrell,  while  praising  Debnam’s  longstanding  support  for  the  Jews.   “Peter  Debnam  has  been  a  very  good  friend  of  the  Jewish  community  and  impressed  people  as  a  sincere  and   dedicated  man.   “  [But]  Mr  O’Farrell  knows  the  con  cerns  of  the  Jewish  community  and  we  should  have  every  trust  in  him  and  see  how  he  goes,”  Levy  told  the  AJN.   Debnam,  who  represents  Vau  cluse,  the  seat  with  the  highest  per  centage  of  Jews  in  the  state,  was  set  to  face-off  with  O’Farrell  for  the  top  job  at  a  caucus  meeting  on  Wednesday.

Reports  suggested  that  Debnam,  a  conservative  from  the  party’s  right  faction,  was  likely  to  be  voted  out  because  of  increased  dissatisfaction  with  his  poor  polling  at  last  month’s   state  election.

Ameinu  Australia  presi  dent  Ron  Finkel  had  hoped  to  debate  the  resolution,  which  has  been  submitted  to  the  Zionist  Federation  of  Australia  (ZFA),  at  this  Sunday’s  80th  anniversary  plenary  in  Sydney,  but  was  told  the  debate  would  be  better  suited  to  the  next  ZFA  meeting  in  October.

Local  JNF  officials  have  called  on  the  groups  behind  the  resolution  to  let  the  dem  ocratic  Israeli  system  find  a  solution  to  the  land-owner  ship  quagmire.   JNF’s  NSW  executive  director  and  Jerusalem  emis  sary  Shalom  Norman  said  the  JNF  has  been  examining  a  multitude  of  options  in  consultation  with  Israeli  politicians  and  land  experts  to  find  a  satisfactory  solution  to  the  controversy.  Possible  solutions  include  the  swap  ping  of  rural  and  urban  land  owned  by  the  Israel  Lands   Authority  and  the  JNF,  which  would  allow  the  JNF  to  observe  its  mandate  of  devel  oping  the  rural  areas,  in  par  ticular  the  Negev  and  the   Galilee.   Norman  said  the  current   arrangement,  under  which  the  I  LA  manages  JNF  land  in  Israel,  may  no  longer  be   relevant.   He  said  the  Diaspora  advocates  who  have  spoken  out  against  the  plan  should  leave  it  to  the  JNF  to  deter  mine  a  suitable  solution.   “We  have  to  find  a  creative  solution,  but  it  won’t  be  found  on  the  stages  of  the  ZFA  assembly  in  Sydney,  with  all  due  respect,”  Norman  said.

"  Jewish  officials  angered  over   ‘dumping*  of  multiculturalism   MELISSA  SINGER  AND  JASON  STEINBERG   A  QUEENSLAND  rabbi  and  several  Jewish  communal  leaders  have  expressed  their  disappointment  with  Prime  Minister  John  Howard’s  deci  sion  to  drop  the  term  “multicultur  alism”  from  a  ministerial  portfolio  as  part  of  a  cabinet  reshuffle  last  week   Dr  Colin  Rubenstein,  executive  director  of  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  (AIJAC),  said  Howard’s  renaming  of  the  Depart  ment  of  Immigration  and  Multicul  tural  and  Indigenous  Affairs  to  the  Department  of  Immigration  and  Cit  izenship,  to  be  headed  by  Minister  Kevin  Andrews,  could  have  “retro  grade  consequences”.   “The  policy  of  Australian  multi  culturalism,  which  has  always  embraced  a  balance  between  rights  and  responsibilities,  has  been  a  great  success  story,”  he  said  in  a  statement   Rabbi  Uri  Themal,  who  helped   formulate  Australia’s  multicultural   policy  in  the  1970s,  said  dropping  the   term  “multiculturalism”  should  con  cern  the  Jewish  community.   “For  the  Jewish  community,  mul  ticulturalism  ensures  we,  just  like  any  other,  can  have  equal  rights  and  opportunities  and  can  contribute  to  society  without  prejudice  and  dis  crimination.  To  replace  it  with  vague  notions  of  citizenship,  shared  values  or  shared  identity  requires  a  much  more  detailed  explanation  of  what  these  are,  along  with  public  debate.”   But  AIJAC  national  chair  Mark  Leibler,  who  is  also  co-chair  of  Recon  ciliation  Australia,  said  what  was  more  important  than  the  term  “mul  ticulturalism”  were  the  policies  behind  it,  which  he  believes  are  intact   Jewish  and  (Muslim  students  embrace  muitlculturallsm,  now  ""dumped”  by  the   Howard  Government.  Photo:  AJN  file   Its  a  pity  the  term  was  removed  because  it  adequately  reflects  what  the  government  policy  is,”  he  said.   Still,  Leibler  acknowledged  that  “those  who  oppose  democracy,  who  oppose  the  rule  of  law,  who  don’t  believe  in  the  need  to  be  tolerant...   and  believe  they  have  the  right  to  do   so  because  this  is  a  ‘multicultural’  country”  had  abused  the  term  “multi  culturalism”,  which  entered  the  Aus  tralian  lexicon  in  the  1960s.   University  of  NSW  academic  Dr  Geoffrey  Braham  Levey,  who  wrote  a  chapter  on  “Jews  and  Australian  Mul  ticulturalism”  in  Jews  and  Australian  Politics,  which  he  also  co-edited,  agreed  that  the  change  was  “not  sig  nificant,  but  symbolic”.   “The  government  didn’t  have  to  abandon  [multiculturalism]  ...  and  matters  aren’t  helped  [in  explaining  the  reason]  by  the  fact  that  the  prime  minister  is  a  long-time  opponent.”   He  said  there  is  a  pervading  “assimilationist”  culture  among  those  who  oppose  the  term.   “The  focus  [of  debate]  is  often  on   the  word  and  its  connotations  ...  on  symbolism  and  images,  but  not  enough  on  practical  methods  aimed  at  inclusion  and  integration.”   Dr  Rubenstein,  a  former  member  of  the  Council  for  a  Multicultural  Australia,  wrote  in  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald  in  November  that  multiculturalism  was  often  misplaced  by  its  critics  as  the  cause  of  “ethnic  and  social  problems”.   During  the  1970s,  Rabbi  Themal  was  a  member  of  an  advisory  com  mittee  that  developed  a  white  paper  called  Multiculturalism  for  all  Aus  tralians  for  the  Fraser  Government.   “The  new  emphasis  seems  to  be  on  nationalism  and  jingoism,  which  is  very  dangerous  because  these  themes  can  appeal  to  people  who  misinterpret  them  in  order  to  pro  mote  prejudice  and  extremist  views.   “Australian  multiculturalism  as  a  policy  has  served  us  well  for  over  30  years  and  as  the  saying  goes,  if  it  ain’t  broke  why  fix  it?” ",2007-02-02
"  but  new  FM  is  a  Jewish  critic   •  •  •   HERB  KEINON   LONDON  -   The  newly  appointed  for  eign  minister  of   Britain  and  ris   ing  star  of  British  politics   David  Miliband  (pictured)  is  the  son  of  immigrant  Polish  Jews.  He  was  also  a  critic  of  Israel’s  handling  of  last  year’s  Second  Lebanon  War.   Miliband  and  his  brother  Ed,  who  was  appointed  to  the  Cabinet  Office,  were  two  of  incoming  Prime  Minis  ter  Gordon  Brown’s  “fresh  faces”  in  the  British  cabinet  this  week,  mark  ing  the  first  time  since  1929  that  brothers  have  served  simultaneously  as  British  ministers.   Together  with  French  Foreign   Minister  Bernard  Kouchner  -  whose   father  was  Jewish  and  who  considers  himself  Jewish  -  it  is  probably  the  first  time  in  history  that  Jews  have  been  charged  with  handling  foreign  policy  of  both  countries  straddling  he  English  Channel.   Educated  at  a  comprehensive  school  and  at  Oxford,  Miliband’s  father  Ralph  changed  his  name  from  Adolphe  when  he  arrived  in  England.  He  escaped  from  Belgium  -  to  which  his  family  had  moved  from  Poland  -  by  getting  one  of  the  last  ships  across  the  channel  in  1940.  Ralph  Miliband  became  a  leading  Marxist  writer,  yet  David  emerged  as  one  of  the  main  thinkers  behind  the  phenomenon  known  as  “New  Labour”.   David  Miliband’s  Jewish  back  ground  allows  him  the  freedom  to  criticise  Israel,  as  he  has  done,  with  out  being  accused  of  antisemitism,   the  BBC  noted.  The  BBC  reported  that  Miliband’s  appointment  could  presage  a  shift  “in  British  foreign  pol  icy  to  one  in  which  criticism  of  the   United  States  and  Israel  is  not  off  the   agenda  -  as  it  was  under  Tony  Blair”.   In  another  high-profile  Jewish   appointment  to  the  new  cabinet,  Brown  has   appointed   Rabbi  Dame   Julia  Neuberger  (pictured)  as   junior  minister  in  charge  of  the  voluntary  sector.

"  Germany’s  Jewish  community   celebrates  dramatic  revival   BERLIN  -  Germany  has  celebrated  the  opening  of  a  new  community  centre  and  the  reopening  of  the  nation’s  largest  synagogue  as  a  sym  bol  of  the  rebirth  of  Jewish  life  in  Germany.   Director  of  the  Chabad-Lubav  itch  centre  Rabbi  Yehuda  Teichtal  said  the  inauguration  was  a  sign  that  Jews  had  recovered  confidence  after  the  Holocaust  that  their  traditions  once  again  had  a  future  in  Germany.   German  Foreign  Minister  Frank  Walter  Steinmeier  and  several  ambassadors  and  rabbis  from  20  nations  -  including  Israel’s  former  chief  rabbi  Meir  Lau  -  were  present  at  the  ceremony  in  the  Wilmersdorf  neighbourhood  of  Berlin,  during  which  the  final  inscription  was  placed  in  a  Torah  scroll.   The  Szloma  Albam  House,  which  is  located  on  Miinstersche  Strasse,  had  been  under  construction  for  three  years.   Designed  by  architect  Sergei  Tchoban,  whose  work  was  nomi  nated  for  a  prize,  the  building  houses  a  yeshiva,  synagogue,  library,  youth  recreation  centre,  kosher  restaurant,  tourist  information  cen   tre  and  a  lecture  hall.  It  also  features   a  replica  of  Jerusalem’s  Western   Wall.   “This  is  a  symbolic  part  of  mak  ing  Berlin  a  central  hub  of  Jewish  life  again,”  said  Rabbi  Teichtal.   The  Jewish  community  in  Ger  many  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  in  the  world,  with  some  120,000  mem  bers  registered  in  religious   communities.   According  to  the  Central  Council  of  Jews  in  Germany,  an  estimated  250.000  Jews  live  in  the  country  in  comparison  with  only  20,000  before   1989.   The  political  changes  that   resulted  from  the  fall  of  the  Berlin  wall  led  to  an  influx  of  Jewish  immi  gration  from  the  Former  Soviet  Union.  This  increased  Germany’s  Jewish  population  by  almost  500  per  cent  in  only  15  years.   Before  the  Holocaust  there  were  560.000  Jews  living  in  Germany.   Another  sign  of  the  revitalisation  of  Jewish  life  in  Berlin  was  last  week’s  reopening  of  Germany’s  largest  synagogue,  on  the  Rykestrasse,  after  more  than  a  year  of  renovations  to  restore  its  beauty   Rabbi  Yehuda  Telchtal  (second  from  right)  speaks  to  Germany’s  Foreign  Minister  Frank-Walter  Stelnmeler  (second  left)  during  the  opening  of  Berlin’s  new  Jewish   community  centre.

The  synagogue,  built  in  1904,  survived  Kristallnacht  on  November  9,1939,  with  only  minor  damage.   It  was  set  on  fire,  but  authorities  quickly  doused  the  flames  due  to   its  location  nestled  in  an  inner   courtyard  of  a  densely  populated  neighborhood.   The  synagogue  was  reinaugu  rated  in  1953,  but  languished  in  dis   repair  and  neglect  under  the  com  munist  East  German  government,  serving  only  East  Berlin’s  tiny  Jewish  community.   During  the  reopening  ceremony,  Rabbi  Chaim  Roswaski  praised  the  synagogue’s  revival  as  “a  miracle”.  The  synagogue  can  hold  more  than  1000  people.

"  Jewish  student  reps   loom  large  on  campus   TALIAKA1Z   JEWISH  representation  in  university   student  bodies  is  on  the  rise  across   campuses  in  NSW  and  Victoria,  with  nine  Jewish  students  elected  to  univer  sity  representative  councils  this  year.   Max  Gross,  21,  was  elected  to  the  Student  Representative  Council  (SRC)  on  Monday  at  La  Trobe  Uni  versity  in  Melbourne.   Gross  told  The  AJNhe  was  proud  to  be  extending  his  role  as  a  Jewish  and  Israel  advocate  to  a  university  level,  following  his  term  as  the  La  Trobe  president  of  Australasian  Union  of  Jewish  Students  (AUJS)  in  2007.   “There  definitely  is  a  space  for  Jew  ish  and  Israel  advocacy  in  my  new  role.  If  any  student  says  they  are  being  treated  unfairly  I’ll  defend  them  as  I’ve  done  in  AUJS,”  he  said.   Gross  also  said  he  was  not  both   ered  by  recent  accusations  of  bias  lev  elled  at  him  by  Melbourne  blogger  Andrew  Landeryou.   “He  has  blogged  on  me  before.  I  just  don’t  think  he  is  a  credible  person  -  he  doesn’t  go  to  La  Trobe...   “I  got  electoral  preferences  from  all  student  groups  -  Labor  left,  Labor  right,  liberals  and  socialists.  They  all  know  me  through  AUJS  and  what  I  stand  for  -  a  more  peaceful  university.   It’s  important  to  focus  on  what  is   common  between  us.”   National  vice-president  David  Bur  nett  said  this  year  had  been  a  record  for  Jewish  elected  representatives.   “AUJS,  during  the  past  year,  has  been  instrumental  in  getting  more  Jews  elected  than  in  other  years.  This  is  probably  an  all-time  record  of  Jews  in  recent  history.”   In  Sydney,  Joshua  Koonin  was   elected  to  the  SRC  of  the  University  of  Sydney  (USYD),  along  with  Burnett,   who  is  the  USYD  union  dubs  and  sodeties’  director.

"  Olmert:  Peace  deal   crucial  for  Jewish  State   JERUSALEM  -  Securing  a  peace  deal  with  the  Palestinians  is  crucial  for  pre  serving  Israel  as  a  democratic  Jewish  state,  Ehud  Olmert  said.  The  Israeli  prime  minister  said  that  despite  the  rocky  prospects  for  peacemaking  fol  lowing  last  week’s  summit  in  Annapolis,  Maryland,  there  is  no  choice  but  to  continue  trying  to  arrange  independence  for  Palestinians  before  they  overwhelm  the  Jewish  State  demographically.   “If  the  day  comes  when  the  two  state  solution  collapses,  and  we  face  a  South  African-style  struggle  for  equal  voting  rights,  then  as  soon  as  that  hap  pens,  the  State  of  Israel  is  finished,”   Olmert  said.  He  added  that  American  Jews  would  be  the  first  to  abandon  an  Israel  that  practises  apartheid-like  policies  in  a  bid  to  maintain  Jewish  primacy.   The  prime  minister  acknowledged  that  Palestinian  Authority  President  Mahmoud  Abbas,  whose  mandate  was  effectively  reduced  to  the  West  Bank   after  Hamas  seized  control  of  the  Gaza   Strip  last  year,  is  a  “weak  partner.  But  it  is  my  job  to  do  everything  so  that  he  receives  foe  tools,  and  to  reach  an  understanding  on  the  guidelines  for  an  agreement,”  Olmert  said.   This  was  despite  Abbas’  refusal  to   US  President  George  W  Bush  (centre)  huddles  with  Palestinian  Authority  President  Mahmoud  Abbas,  (left)  and  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Olmert  during  the  recent   peace  talks  In  Annapolis,  Maryland.

Eighteen  per  cent  called  the  conference  in  the  Maryland  capital  a  success.  A  poll  in  Ha’aretz  had  similar  figures  for  opinions  on  whether  Annapolis  Med  or  succeeded  -  42  per  cent  versus  17  per  cent  Eighty-three  per  cent  of  the  Yediot  respondents  said  they  did  not  believe  there  would  be  an  Israeli-Palestinian  peace  accord  by  the  end  of  2008,  the  deadline  set  by   Olmert  and  Abbas.

"  Jewish  schools  snub  Harmony  Day  poster  competition   LEX!  LANDSMAN   THE  Jewish  co-chair  of  a  Harmony  Day  poster  competition  for  students  has  criticised  several  Sydney  Jewish  schools  for  not  taking  part  in  the   initiative.   Ernie  Friedlander,  chair  of  the  B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Com  mission  education  taskforce,  said  it  was  “highly  disappointing”  that  of  the  2900  entries  from  across  the  state,  only  119,  or  four  per  cent,  were  from  Jewish  students,  some  of  whom  do  not  even  attend  Jewish  schools.   According  to  Friedlander,  only  two  Jewish  schools,  Kesser  Torah  and  Moriah  colleges,  participated.   “Jewish  schools  once  again  were  not  well  represented.  The  issue  is  that  unfortunately  there  doesn’t  seem  to  be  an  interest  to  promote  this  compe  tition,”  Friedlander  told  the  AJN  this  week  “Particularly  with  the  rise  of  antisemitism,  harmony  is  something   we  should  all  strive  for  -  it’s  non-con  frontational,  it’s  positive  and  it’s  productive.”   Despite  the  schools’  poor  showing,  one  Jewish  student,  Sam  Heath  from  Sydney  Technical  High  School,  made  the  finals  of  the  annual  competition,  which  the  ADC  runs  in  conjunction  with  the  Chinese  Australian  Forum.   Sponsored  by  the  City  of  Sydney,  the  competition  was  open  to  primary  and  secondary  students  across  the  state.  This  year’s  theme  was  “harmony   matters”.   With  overall  entries  also  down  from  3500  in  2006,  Friedlander  stressed  the  importance  of  continued  support  for  the  project,  particularly  from  the  Jewish  community.   “The  competition  projects  a  posi  tive  message  and  gets  people  to  stop,   consider  and  realise  that  conflict  and  violence  are  counterproductive  to  society.  We,  as  Jews,  having  suffered  for  a  long  time,  know  how  important  it  is  for  people  to  stop  and  think,  and  stop  race  hate.”   Masada  College  principal  Wendy  Barel  told  the  AJN  that  while  Masada  celebrates  Harmony  Day,  which  falls  each  year  on  March  21,  the  students  were  unable  to  enter  the  competition  due  to  class  time  constraints.   “We’re  inundated  with  various  competitions  and  unfortunately  it  didn’t  tie  in  with  the  curriculum,”  she  said.  “In  future  years,  we  would  encourage  the  organisers  to  come  to  the  school  to  address  the  students  and  inspire  them  to  get  involved  in  their   own  time.”   Dr  Bruce  Carter,  principal  of  the  Emanuel  School,  told  the  AJN  that  he  would  “push  harder  for  the  competi  tion  and  give  it  more  attention  in  future  years”.

"  Gillard  shares  migrant  tale  with  Jewish  women   NAOMI  LEVIN   DEPUTY  Opposition  Leader  Julia  Gillard  has  told  a  Jewish  audience  how  the  Federal  Government  of  the   1970s  and  ’80s  gave  her  migrant  fam  ily  a  fresh  start  in  the  country.   Addressing  the  National  Council  of  Jewish  Women  of  Australia’s  (NCJWA’s)  corporate  breakfast  in  Melbourne  last  Thursday,  Gillard  related  her  experience  of  being  a  migrant  from  Wales  to  South  Aus  tralia  to  more  than  100  guests  at  Ernst  and  Young’s  Melbourne  headquarters.   Weaving  examples  of  Labor’s  edu  cation,  health  and  social  policy  into  her  own  memories,  she  said:  “Gov  ernment  can  make  a  difference  to   people’s  lifetime  opportunity  and,  more  than  anything  else,  I  believe  that  is  what  the  next  election  is  all  about.”   Educated  at  a  state  school  in  South  Australia  and  at  university  in  the  1980s,  when  it  was  free,  Gillard  praised  the  policies  of  the  time.   “These  supports  from  government  made  a  difference  to  my  family’s  life,”   she  said.   Following  her  address,  Gillard  fielded  questions  on  issues  affecting  Australian  Jews  in  the  lead-up  to  this  year’s  federal  election,  promising  to  examine  community  security  costs  if  Labor  wins  government.   “I  understand  [the  issue]  and  ...

She  also  highlighted  Australia’s  foreign  policy  and  schools  funding  as  key  issues  for  the  Jewish  community  at  this  year’s  poll,  but  did  not  make  any  specific  reference  to  Labor’s  plan  for  the  government’s  controversial  funding  model,  which  has  been  accused  of  disadvantaging  “poorer”  Jewish  schools  that  are  located  in  wealthy  areas.   “I  think  Labor  has  views  on  those   issues  that  are  very  sympathetic  to  the  Jewish  community,”  she  said.   Gillard,  who  has  left  some  Jewish  leaders  concerned  over  her  lack  of  vocal  support  for  Israel,  said  that  a  2005  visit  gave  her  a  better  understanding  of  the  issues  affecting  the  Jewish  State.   “You  know  intellectually  about  the  degree  of  threat  for  Israel  and  about  the  foreign  policy  complexities  and  about  all  the  challenges  that  it  faces   from  Hamas  and  Hezbollah  but  to   actually  be  able  to  see  that  on  the  ground  leaves  a  real  impression.” ",2007-07-27
"  Censorship  reforms  ignore  race  hate  -  Jewish  leaders   YONI  BASHAN   JEWISH  leaders  are  preparing  a  for  mal  submission  to  Attorney-General  Philip  Ruddock  amid  fears  that  pro  posed  changes  to  Australia’s  censor  ship  laws  are  too  soft.   Ruddock’s  proposed  changes,  due  for  release  this  week,  would  tighten  censorship  laws  to  implement  a  ban  on  material  that  “advocates  terrorism”.   Current  legislation  only  prohibits  material  that  incites  or  provokes  crim   inal  violence.   However,  the  new  laws  would  dis  tinguish  “hate  material”  from  “mate  rial  that  advocates  terrorist  acts”.   Jeremy  Jones,  community  affairs  director  of  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jew  ish  Affairs  Council,  told  the  AJN  the  move  fails  to  address  racial  hatred  and   won’t  stop  other  inflammatory  mate  rial  from  reaching  an  audience.   “Our  concern  is  that  it  doesn’t  seem  to  address  the  nexus  between  rational   isation  and  justification  of  hate  and   actions  based  on  this  hate.   “The  Holocaust  did  not  begin  with   the  construction  of  extermination   camps  -  it  started  with  propaganda  and  dehumanising  others.”   'The  Holocaust  did  not  begin  with  the  construction  of   extermination  camps  -  it   I  started  with  propaganda   and  dehumanising   others.”   JEREMY  JONES  Community  affairs  director,  AUAC   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  David  Knoll  said  the  clause   would  allow  other  fundamentalist   titles  to  slip  through  the  net.   “The  government  paper  does  not   recognise  the  link  between  extreme  forms  of  racial  hatred  and  the  glorifi   cation  of  terrorism,”  Knoll  said.   “Such  material  [should]  be  either  harmed  or  given  the  most  restrictive  rating  possible.”   The  proposal  follows  public  outcry  over  last  month’s  decision  by  the  Office  of  Film  and  Literature  Classification  to  give  a  PG  rating  to  a  DVD  in  which  exiled  Islamic  cleric  Sheikh  Feiz  Muhammad  refers  to  Jews  as  “pigs”.  A  PG  rating,  which  stands  for  parental  guidance  recommended,  makes  the  title  suitable  for  viewing  by  children.   Several  Jewish  groups  are  expected  to  make  their  submissions  to  the  gov  ernment  through  the  Executive  Coun  cil  of  Australian  Jewry  before  the  May   31  deadline.   In  January,  the  AJN  revealed  that  at  least  two  of  Sheikh  Feiz’s  titles,  Signs  of  the  Hour  and  The  Grave,  were  produced  and  sold  in  Sydney’s   south-west. ",2007-05-04
"  teens  targeted  in   anti-violence   YONI  BASHAN   JEWISHCARE  will  target  teenagers  in  a  rigorous  social-welfare  campaign  aimed  at  stamping  out  domestic  vio  lence  in  the  community.   Last  week,  Wentworth  MP  Mal  colm  Turnbull  announced  a  $93,600  funding  boost  from  the  Federal  Gov  ernment  for  JewishCare’s  program,  Opening  Closed  Doors,  addressing  domestic  and  family  violence  in  the  Jewish  community.   During  talks  with  Turnbull,  Jewish  Care  officials  said  the  initiative  would  target  students  in  Years  10  and  11.   “This  is  an  example  of  the  Federal  Government  taking  a  lead  role  in  the  elimination  of  violence  and  sexual  assault  against  women,”  Turnbull   said.   A  community  taskforce  compris  ing  caseworkers  and  various  support   networks  will  be  established  to  encourage  Jews  to  speak  out  about  their  ordeals.   JewishCare  president  Eva  Fischl  said  the  problem  is  often  played  down  in  Jewish  families  because  of  the  “huge  element  of  shame”  involved.   “[Domestic  violence]  exists  in  our  community,  but  people  won’t  come  out  of  the  closet,  which  makes  it  even  harder  to  help  them.”   Malcolm  Turnbull  MP  (second  from  right)  with  JewishCare  representatives  after   announcing  the  Federal  Government’s  $93,600  contribution  to  a  new  campaign  to  tackle  domestic  violence  In  the  Jewish  community.   According  to  JewishCare’s  policy  advisor,  Professor  Ron  Penny,  domes  tic  violence  is  on  the  rise  in  the  com  munity  and  is  likely  to  spiral  out  of  control  if  preventative  measures  are  not  put  in  place.   “People  only  perceive  domestic  vio  lence  as  physical,  but  the  verbal  abuse  is  more  destructive  and  far  more  dan  gerous,”  Professor  Penny  told  the  AJN.   Roberta  Freedman,  who  will  over   see  the  project,  said  the  government  grant  comes  at  a  critical  time  for  Jew  ishCare,  which  draws  more  than  40  per  cent  of  its  funding  from  the  gov  ernment;  around  25  per  cent  comes  from  the  Jewish  Communal  Appeal.   “We  have  not  had  the  opportunity  before  to  run  educational  awareness  programs  [and]  it’s  a  way  to  approach  family  violence  in  a  different  way,”   Freedman  said.

"  State  funeral  for  former  Victorian   minister,  Jewish  identity   PETER  KOHN   COMMUNAL  veteran  and  former  Victorian  Government  minister  Walter  Jona  died  at  his  Toorak  home  on  Sunday  night,  five  days  after  his  81st  birthday.   Jona,  who  succumbed  to  cancer,  will  be  laid  to  rest  at  Melbourne’s   Progressive  Jewish  Memorial  Gar  den  cemetery  on  Thursday  after  a  state  funeral  at  Temple  Beth  Israel.   It  will  be  the  first  state  funeral  for   a  Jewish  public  figure  since  that  of   NSW  state  cabinet  minister  Paul   Landa,  23  years  ago.   Jona,  the  son  of  well-known  Jew  ish  community  figure  Dr  Jacob  Jona,  took  an  interest  in  politics  and  was  elected  to  the  Victorian  Parlia  ment  in  1964  as  the  Liberal  member  for  Hawthorn.   He  made  an  early  name  for  him  self  as  the  chair  of  an  all-party  com  mittee  on  road  safety  that  led  to  Victoria’s  pioneering  adoption  of  compulsory  seatbelts.   He  was  promoted  to  a  cabinet  position  by  Premier  Dick  (later  Sir  Rupert)  Hamer  in  1976.

As  chair  of  the  Victorian  Union   for  Progressive  Judaism  in  the  1980s,  he  joined  Isi  Leibler  in  lead  ing  a  groundbreaking  lay  commit   tee  to  resolve  differences  between   the  Progressive  and  Orthodox   communities.   “Australian  Jewry  has  lost  one  of  its  most  noble  sons,”  Leibler  said  from  Jerusalem  on  Monday.   Last  year,  at  age  80,  he  finished  a  228-page  autobiography  on  his  career  in  Victorian  politics  and  his  role  in  Jewish  communal  affairs,  which  was  launched  by  Victorian  Opposition  Leader  Ted  Baillieu.   Jona  is  survived  by  his  wife  Alwynne,  whom  he  described  in  2006  as  “my  perfect  partner”.   A  longstanding  chair  of  Magen  David  Adorn  in  Australia,  Jona  told  the  AJN  last  year:  “Rescuing  peo  ple’s  lives  or  giving  them  the  strength  to  cope  with  their  burdens  was  a  theme  that  has  run  through  my  public  life  because  it  reminds  me  of  the  talmudic  saying  that  is  sometimes  associated  with  Magen  David  Adorn,  that  ‘he  who  saves  a  life,  it  is  as  if  he  has  saved  the  world’”   Temple  Beth  Israel  emeritus  Rabbi  John  Levi  said  Jona  “saved  tens  of  thousands  of  lives  through  the  seatbelt  legislation”  and  used  his  community  welfare  services  portfo  lio  to  champion  prison  reform.   Jona  was  awarded  an  Order  of  Australia  (AM)  in  1986  for  services  to  the  community,  particularly  to  the  Jewish  community.

"  THE  REBUTTAL   Jewish  democracy  is  the  norm   THE  Australian  Jewish  community's  elected  representative  bodies  are  open  and   democratic,  which  is  why  the  claims  of  the  so-called  Independent  Australian  Jewish  Voices  (IAJV)  should  not  be  treated  at  face  value.   This  group  calls  for  “a  just  peace  that  recognises  the  legitimate  national  aspira  tions  of  both  Israelis  and  Palestinians  with  a  solution  that  protects  the  human  rights  of  all"",  as  if  that  is  not  what  the  Jewish  community’s  representative  bodies  have  been  advocating  for  many  years.   The  leadership  of  the  Australian  Jewish  community  is  a  respected  and  credible  voice  in  public  forums,  precisely  because  we  use  reasoned  argument  and  sound  research  to  pursue  sensible  policies  that  reflect  majority  views.   The  IAJV  also  calls  for  “reasoned  argument  rather  than  vilification  and  intimida  tion”.This  might  be  an  attempt  at  self-criticism,  given  the  barrage  of  uninformed  crit  icism  directed  at  the  Jewish  community’s  elected  leadership  by  some  of  the  lAJV’s  signatories.  Given  the  fact  that  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  fighting  vilification  and  intimidation,  not  only  of  Jews,  but  also  of  all  who  face  unlawful  vilification,  it  is  difficult  to  understand  why  else  they  would  have   included  this  statement   The  IAJV  then  says  that  they  seek  “debate  to  further  the  prospects  of  peace,  security  and  human  rights  in  the  Middle  East”.  Anyone  who  is  engaged  in  any  mean  ingful  way  with  the  Jewish  community,  or  has  witnessed  the  many  open  forums  such  as  the  monthly  public  meetings  of  the  respective  Jewish  umbrella  bodies,  knows  that  discussion  and  airing  of  diverse  views  is  the  norm.   The  IAJV  could  take  advantage  of  the  democratic  processes  which  elect  the  lead  ership  of  Australia’s  Jewish  community  and  nominate  for  election  to  these  bodies.  That  it  chooses  not  to,  but  instead  implies  the  Jewish  community  leadership  acts  in  ways  it  does  not,  speaks  volumes  regarding  its  concern  for  democratic  ideals.

"  JASON  FRENKEL   THE  B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commission  (ADC)  has  lashed  Aus  tralia’s  Muslim  community  for  throwing  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly  a  lifeline  as  the  nation’s  Islamic  spiri   tual  leader.   The  ADC  said  it  was  “bewildered”  by  the  weekend  decision  of  the  National  Board  of  Imams  (NBI)  to  grant  the  controversial  cleric  a  three  month  extension  of  his  role  as  mufti,  describing  him  as  a  bigot  who  was  unfit  to  lead  a  religious  institution.   The  (NBI)  has  set  up  a  committee   to  consult  with  Muslims  and  choose   a  replacement  for  Sheikh  Hilaly  by  the  middle  of  the  year.   The  Executive  Council  of  Aus   tralian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  said  that  it  was  encouraging  that  the  end  of  Sheikh  Hilal/s  tenure  appeared  to  be   imminent.   But  the  ADC  said  the  three   month  extension  was  “counterpro  ductive”,  a  view  backed  by  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  and  Opposi   tion  Leader  Kevin  Rudd.   “Though  largely  a  ceremonial  position,  this  decision  highlights  the  support  this  racist  and  anti-Aus  tralian  sheikh  has  among  the  Muslim  community,”  ADC  executive  officer  Manny  Waks  said.   “With  his  track  record,  Sheikh  Hilaly  is  not  fit  to  lead  any  religious   institution.”   Howard  said  the  council’s  deci   sion  was  at  loggerheads  with  com  munity  sentiment  and  would  have  an  “extremely  negative”  impact.   “They’re  exercising  their  right  -  it’s  not  our  power  or  right  to  appoint   Executive  officer  of  the  ADC  Manny   Walks:  “Sheikh  Hlialy  Is  not  fit  to  lead  any  religious  Institution.”   religious  leaders  -  but  I  think  they’re  doing  their  community  damage,”  the   PM  said.   “I  remain  very  strongly  of  the  view  that  they’re  very  much  out  of  touch  with  community  sentiment.”   Rudd  said  Muslim  leaders  had   made  a  mistake  by  extending  Sheikh  Hilal/s  term.   “Australia’s  Muslim  leadership  should  not  be  taking  any  decision  which  allows  someone  like  [Sheikh]  al-Hilaly,  who’s  gone  out  there  and  defended  pack  rapists,  to  remain  as  mufti  of  Australia,  even  if  it’s  for  another  three  months,”  Rudd  said.   ECAJ  president  Grahame  Leonard  said  Australian  Jews  would  welcome  Sheikh  Hilal/s  eventual  departure   from  national  affairs.   “The  important  thing  from  our  community’s  perspective  is  that  the  only  people  who  can  really  sort  it  out   are  the  leaders  of  the  Australian  Mus  lim  community,”  he  said.  “The  encouraging  thing  is  that  it  looks  like  that  is  going  to  happen.” ",2007-03-30
"&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   JEWISH  GROUPS  WELCOME   $8m  ISLAMIC-STUDIES  CENTRE     PETER  KOHN     THE  Jewish  community  should  “cau-  tiously  welcome”  a  multi-campus  Islamic  studies  centre  announced  by  three  major  Australian  universities   this  week.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  president  Grahame  Leonard  said  the  initiative,  which  has  the  backing  of  the  Federal  Govern-  ment  “has  objectives  we  very  much  applaud”.   The  National  Centre  of  Excellence  for  Islamic  Studies,  which  will  receive  $8  million  in  funding  from  the  Feder-  al  Government,  will  be  a  shared  resource  of  the  University  of  Mel-  bourne,  Brisbane’s  Griffith  University  and  the  University  of  Western  Sydney.   Leonard  said  the  appointment  of  Professor  Abdullah  Saeed,  an  acclaimed  Islamic  educator  at  the  University  of  Melbourne,  as  the  cen-  tre’s  director  “is  comforting  and  a  good  appointment  ...  we  have  had  dealings  with  him  and  find  him  to  be   a  moderate”.   But  he  cautioned  that  the  centre,  an  initiative  of  Parliamentary  Secre-  tary  for  Multicultural  Affairs  Andrew  Robb,  would  need  to  be  carefully   monitored.   Its  curriculum  and  lecturers  “will  need  regular  quality-assurance  checks  to  see  that  the  objectives  as  stated  are  being  achieved  and  it  doesn’t  become  yet  another  source  of  home-grown  extremist,  fundamentalist  Islamic  radicalism”.   Leonard  said  the  centre  has  the   Left:  EGAJ  president  Grahame  Leonard:  “Objectives  we  applaud.”   Right:  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff:  “Controls  are  needed.”     prospect  of  countering  local  radicals   such  as  Australian-born  Sheikh  Feiz  Mohammad,  whose  sermons  last  week  revealed  him  likening  Jews  to  pigs  and  calling  on  Muslims  to  teach  their  children  to  die  for  jihad,  as  well  as  Australia’s  Mufti,  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly,  and  Melbourne’s  Sheikh  Mohammed  Omran.   “At  the  end  of  the  day,  the  only  [group]  who  can  appropriately  deal  with  these  extremists  is  Australia’s  Muslim  community  itself.”   One  of  the  centre’s  objectives  is  reportedly  to  train  home-grown  imams  and  help  develop  leadership  in  the  Muslim  community.   B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation   Commission  chairman  Michael  Lip-  shutz  also  welcomed  the  new  centre  as  a  potential  boost  for  inter-faith  relations  and  as  a  safeguard  against  the  influence  of  radicals  on  young   Australian  Muslims.   “If  the  centre  allows  non-Islamic  people  to  learn  about  Islam  and  allows  young  Muslims  to  learn  about  their  religion  and  culture,  it  can  become  a  counterpoint  to  extremism.”   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  said:  “The  key  issue   is  that  there  have  to  be  controls  in  place,  both  in  terms  of  who  is  appointed  to  teach  and  what  it  is  that  is  being  taught.   “Recent  comments  by  some  Aus-  tralian-based  sheikhs  demonstrate  that  having  local  connections  is  no  guarantee  that  some  leaders  will  not  engage  in  racial  hatred.   “The  composition  and  involve-  ment  of  the  centre’s  advisory  board  will  therefore  be  critical  in  helping  to  ensure  that  moderate  teaching  is  practised.”   University  of  Melbourne  academic  Dr  Dvir  Abramovich  welcomed  the  initiative  and  said  he  hoped  the  centre  “will  be  active  in  the  inter-faith  move-  ment  and  will  support  harmonious  dialogue  among  various  religions,  including  Judaism”.   Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  director  of  community  and  international  affairs  Jeremy  Jones  said:  “The  big  challenge  for  the  Aus-  tralian  Government  is  to  make  sure  that  the  people  running  that  institu-  tion  are  genuinely  promoting  ‘gentle  Islam’  or  an  Islam  which  is  not  in  con-  frontation  with  other  ways  of  life.”   WITH  YONI  BASHAN ",2007-01-26
"  Concern  over  future  direction  of  Jewish  philanthrophy   JACOB  BERKMAN   NEW  YORK  -  America’s  largest  Jewish  foundations  give  about  one-fifth  of  their  funds  to  Jewish  causes—and  that  number  could  fall,  according  to  the  researchers  behind  a  recently  released  report   The  study  conducted  by  the  Insti  tute  for  Jewish  and  Community  Research  was  based  on  a  review  of  the  2004  and  2005  tax  returns  of  the  56   largest  American  foundations  started   by  Jews.  The  foundations  reviewed  in  the  study  handed  out  $US1.2  billion,  with  21  per  cent  going  to  Jewish  causes,  including  seven  per  cent  to  causes  in  Israel.   Although  that  may  appear  to  be  a  small  slice  of  the  philanthropic  pie,  Jewish  interests  were  still  the  largest  recipients  of  these  foundations’  money,  followed  by  higher  education  at  17  per  cent,  health-related  causes  at  16  per  cent,  and  arts  and  culture  inter  ests  at  14  per  cent   “It  is  what  you  would  expect  from  a  really  integrated  Jewish  commu  nity,”  said  Gary  Tobin,  co-author  of  the  study.   Tobin  said  the  21  per  cent  given  to  Jewish  causes  could  fell  drastically  as  control  of  the  foundations  is  passed  to  the  next  generation  of  directors,  who  may  place  less  of  a  priority  on  Jewish   causes.   “The  further  the  foundations  get  from  the  founding  donor,  the  more  likely  it  is  that  they  will  move  away   from  the  wishes  of  the  founding  donor,”  Tobin  said.   “The  founding  donor  might  care  a  lot  about  Jewish  causes,  but  his  grand  children  or  spouse  or  children  might   not”   Jeffrey  Solomon,  president  of  the  Andrea  and  Charles  Bronfman  Family  Foundation,  one  of  the  foundations  studied,  said:  “It  is  a  well-known  and  sad  fact  of  philanthropy  that  donor  intent  cannot  be  managed  from  the   grave.   ha ",2007-10-26

Abraham  Jacobs,  who  immigrated  from  Malaysia  in  1975,  has  so  far  raised  $7000  to  restore  the  cemetery,  but  needs  an  additional  $5000  to  improve  drainage  at  the  cemetery,  which  is  prone  to  flooding.   “One  part  of  the  cemetery  is  lower  than  the  other.  When  it  rains,  it  floods  and  damages  all  the  graves,”  Mr  Jacobs  explained.   The  82  year  old  has  travelled  to   Malaysia  twice  a  year  for  the  past  six  years  in  a  desperate  bid  to  protect  the  Jewish  bodies  buried  there,  which  include  those  of  his  father  and  son.   “I  go  there  to  make  sure  every-  thing  is  being  done  correctly  -  I  supervise  the  work  that’s  being  done.”   Six  year  ago,  Mr  Jacobs  formed  the  Penang  Jewish  Welfare  Board  after  a  grave  was  so  badly  damaged  that  the  corpse  was  visible.   Mr  Jacobs  said  he  has  also  battled  the  Malaysian  Government,  when  five  years  ago  it  wrote  to  the  board  saying  it  was  repossessing  the  cemetery  property.   “In  Jewish  law,  once  a  person  is  buried  they  must  rest  in  peace,  so  we   said,  no?’   During  the  1900s,  there  were  as  many  as  25  Jewish  families  living  in  Penang,  but  by  1975,  almost  all  of  them  had  immigrated,  mostly  to  Syd-   ney.   Since  1991,  the  board  has  paid  for  a  family  of  caretakers  to  look  after  the  cemetery.   A  Bondi  Lions  Club  member  for  16  years,  Mr  Jacobs  also  founded  a  charity  that  has  helped  some  400   Indonesians  who  were  born  with   cleft-palate  defects.   There  are  believed  to  be  around   100  Jews  still  living  in  Malaysia  today.  -------------------------------------------------   Inquiries:  0413  019  321. ",2007-01-12
"  Drugs  listing  may  help  Jewish  Crohn’s  patients   YONI  BASHAN   THOUSANDS  of  Jews  affected  by  Crohn’s  disease  could  be  thrown  a  financial   lifeline  after  a  parliamentary  advisory  committee  recom  mended  a  specialised  drug   receive  Federal  Government  funding.   The  Pharmaceutical  Bene  fits  Advisory  Committee  handed  down  its  decision  after  six  previous  attempts  by  the  manufacturers  of  Infliximab,  Schering-Plough,  to  subsidise  the  costly  treatment.   Around  28,000  Australians  suffer  from  Crohn’s,  with  Ashkenazi  Jews  four  to  five  times  more  likely  to  inherit  the  digestive  disease,  which  cur  rently  has  no  known  cure.   A  single  infusion,  adminis  tered  by  a  hospital  drip,  can  cost  upwards  of  $4000.   If  funding  is  approved,  the  Infliximab  price  tag  will  likely  be  reduced  to  around  $30  per  infusion,  and  will  be  provided   to  extreme  cases  on  a  mainte   nance-dosage  basis.   A  petition  carrying  25,000  names  of  patients,  doctors  and  pharmaceutical  groups  will  be  delivered  to  Health  Minister  Tony  Abbott  this  week.   The  AJN  understands  that  listing  the  drug  will  cost  the  government  tens  of  millions  in  subsidies.   One  Jewish  Crohn’s  patient,  who  would  only  be  identified  as  “Harvey”,  told  the  AJN  that  Infliximab  is  “basically  unaf  fordable”  for  most  people.   The  62-year-old  small  busi  ness  owner  was  diagnosed  with  Crohn’s  disease  as  a  teenager.  He  said  people  who  can’t  afford  the  drug  live  in   constant  discomfort.   “There’s  just  nothing  else  at  all  at  the  moment  that  works,”   he  said.   “This  sort  of  treatment  is   the  only  thing  they’ve  come  up   with  and  it  does  seem  to  be  100  per  cent  effective.”   Sally  Tobin  from  the  Aus  tralian  Crohns  and  Colitis  Association  told  the  AJN  that  Jewish  groups  should  get  behind  the  push  to  have  the  drug  listed.   “These  inflammatory  bowel  diseases  are  very  preva  lent  in  the  Jewish  community,”   Tobin  said.   “Our  priorities  will  be  building  relationships  with  the  Jewish  community  because  it’s   such  a  serious  issue.”   Info:  www.soregut.com;   www.acca.net.au.

"  Jewish  Crohn’s  patients   welcome  new  PBS  listing   LEXI  LANDSMAN   THOUSANDS  of  Jews  affected  by  Crohn’s  disease  will  now  be  given  a  financial  helping  hand  with  the  drug  Infliximab  being  offered  on  the  Pharmaceutical  Benefits  Scheme  (PBS).   The  Australian  Crohn’s  &amp;  Colitis  Association  (ACCA),  which  made  the  announce   ment  last  week,  said  the  listing  would  come  into  play  from  October  this  year.   Around  28,000  Australians  suffer  from  Crohn’s  disease,  with  Ashkenazi  Jews  four  to  five  times  more  likely  to  inherit  the  digestive  disease,  which  currently  has  no  known   cure.   Central  Synagogue  congre  gant  Tali  Nafte,  22,  was  diag   nosed  with  Crohn’s  disease  six   years  ago,  but  has  been  in   remission  for  the  last  few   months.  She  said  that  the  PBS  listing  is  “fantastic”.   Nafte  said  she  has  been  in   and  out  of  hospital  many  times  and  has  tried  many  medications,  often  at  great  financial  expense.   “If  I  do  relapse  in  the  future,  it  is  a  huge  comfort  to   know  that  there  are  even  bet  ter  drugs  available,”  she  said.  “The  fact  that  [Infliximab]  is  now  being  subsidised  just  goes  to  show  that  the  government  is  finally  acknowledging  what  a  widespread  problem  Crohn’s   has  become.”   Crohn’s  disease  and  ulcera  tive  colitis  are  two  chronic  dis   orders,  collectively  known  as  inflammatory  bowel  disease  (IBD),  both  of  which  have  no   cure.   Crohn’s  disease  causes   symptoms  including  severe  pain,  diarrhoea,  fatigue,  bleed  ing  and  malnutrition.   Prior  to  the  drug  being  listed,  a  single  infusion,  administered  by  a  hospital  drip,  cost  upwards  of  $4000,  and  could  equate  to  between  $30,000  and  $45,000  annually.   The  AJN  understands  that  the  new  listing  will  reduce  the  Infliximab  price  tag  to  around  $30  per  infusion.   ACCA  chief  executive   Francesca  Manglaviti  told  the  AJN:  “We  are  absolutely  delighted  with  the  result.  It’s  a  big  advancement  in  current   treatments  available  and  will   significantly  help  sufferers.”   The  government  action  came  after  a  petition  carrying  25,000  names  of  patients,  doc  tors  and  pharmaceutical  groups  was  delivered  to  Health  Minister  Tony  Abbott  earlier  this  year.   www.soregut.com;   www.acca.net.au.

"  Burma’s  small  Jewish  community  lives  in  tear   ITAMAR  EICHNER   RANGOON  -  Very  little  is  left  of  the  Jewish  community  in  Myanmar.  At  its  peak  in  the  1940s,  the  community  in   former  Burma  numbered  some  4000   Jews,  mostly  of  Iranian,  Iraqi,  and  Indian  origin.  Now  there  are  only  20   of  them  left.   Burma’s  Jews  started  leaving  dur  ing  World  War  II.  Most  fled  when  ■  Japan  invaded  the  country,  choosing   to  immigrate  to  the  United  States  and   Israel.   /  In  1962,  after  General  Ne  Win’s  ^  military  coup,  the  community  dwin   dled'  again;  more  Jews  left  in  1964,   after  the  military  regime  began  nationalising  private  businesses.   Burma’s  remaining  Jews  are  con  centrated  in  Yangon  and  in  the  coun  try’s  second  largest  city,  Mandalay.   There  is  no  community  life  to  speak  of  and  any  interaction  takes  place  during  Shabbat  and  the  holi  days,  when  they  meet  in  the  syna  gogue  for  prayers.   Sami  Samuels,  one  of  Yangon’s  Jews,  said:  “The  Jewish  community  here  lives  in  fear.  Nobody  knows  what  might  happen  tomorrow.   “Rosh  Hashanah  and  Succot  were  the  saddest  we’ve  had  in  a  very  long  time  ...  we  had  to  adjust  the  prayer   services  to  the  military's  curfew,  the  streets  are  crawling  with  soldiers  and  the  situation  here  is  very  unstable.   “The  Jews,  like  many  others  here,   fear  for  their  lives.”   The  tensions  between  the  military  junta  and  Buddhist  monks  have  made  the  Jewish  community  take  extra  precautions  and  they  have  recently  hired  a  private  security  com  pany  to  guard  Yangon’s  only   synagogue.   “The  unrest  here  makes  it  hard  for  us  to  even  find  the  quorum  needed  for  prayers,”  said  Samuels.   “There  are  usually  a  lot  of  tourists  here  at  this  time  of  year,  but  this  year,   because  of  the  riots,  there  are  very  few  of  them.  Everywhere  you  look  all  you  see  are  people  rushing  home  .”   The  community  is  so  few  in  num  bers,  he  said,  that  they  sometimes  find  themselves  celebrating  some  of  the  holidays  with  the  Buddhist  monks.   Samuels’  father,  Moshe,  is  the  gabai  (manager)  of  Yangon’s  syna  gogue,  which  was  built  in  1854.   Unlike  his  son,  Samuels  senior  is  slightly  more  optimistic,  saying:  “The  military  junta  here  has  no  grudge  against  the  Jews.  We  stay  out  of  poli  tics,  so  what  goes  around  has  no  real   bearing  on  us.   YNETNEWS.COM ",2007-10-12
"  A  scene  from  Israeli  film-maker  Dror  Shaul’s  award-winning  film  Sweet  Mud.   Annual  festival  toasts  the  best  of  Jewish  cinema   DARREN  LEVIN   GARY  Lucas,  an  acclaimed  New  York   based  guitarist  who  has  performed  with  the  likes  of  Nick  Cave,  Lou  Reed  and  Iggy  Pop,  will  open  the  2007  Festival  of  Jewish  Cinema  in  Melbourne  and  Sydney  next.month.   Lucas,  who  co-wrote  two  tracks  on  Jeff  Buckley’s  Grace  (the  title  track  and  Mojo  Phi),  will  perform  an  original  live  score  for  a  screening  of  the  1920s  silent  film  The  Golem.   A  German  expressionist  classic,  the  film  recounts  an  ancient  Jewish  legend  about  a  16th-century  rabbi  who  made  a  man  out  of  clay  to  save  his  community.  Often  referred  to  as  the  precursor  to  Frankenstein,  the  film  was  shot  by  Karl  Freund,  who  worked  on  Fritz  Lang’s  Metropolis  and  FW  Murnau’s  The   Last  Laugh.  Lucas  has  performed  The  Golem  in  more  than  15  countries.   Other  highlights  of  this  year’s  festival  include  the  Australian  premieres  of  La  Question  Humane,  a  powerful  thriller  from  France  which  screened  at  this  year’s  Cannes  Film  Festival;  My  Mexican  Shivah,  a  comedy  set  in  Mexico  City’s  small  but  vibrant  Jewish  community;  The  Year  My  Parents  Went  on  Vacation,  a  partly  autobiographical  film  set  in  1970s  Brazil;  and  winner  of  the  Grand  Jury  Prize  at  Sundance,  Sweet  Mud.   Set  on  an  Israeli  kibbutz  in  the  mid-1970s,  Sweet  Mud,  the  second  feature  by  Israeli  film  maker  Dror  Shaul,  tells  the  story  of  a  son’s  rela  tionship  with  his  emotionally-fragile  mother.   After  garnering  much  acclaim  at  the  Melbourne  International  Film  Festival  earlier  this  year,  Jellyfish,  the  debut  feature  from   Shira  Geffen  and  Etgar  Keret,  will  screen  in  Australia  again  as  part  of  the  Festival  of   Jewish  Cinema.  There  will  also  be  an  encore  presentation  of  German  director  Oliver  Herschbiegel’s  Just  An  Ordinary  Jew,  which  screened  at  the  event  last  year.   In  a  first  for  the  festival,  three  newly  restored  archive  prints  of  classic  Yiddish  films  will  be  shown  -  The  Cantor’s  Son,  Mothers  of  Today  and  The  Vow.

"  Bronfman  resignation  spurs  Aussie  return  to  World  Jewish  Congress   ASHLEY  BROWNE  AND  LISA  HOSTEIN   AUSTRALIA’S  peak  Jewish  body  is  likely  to  rejoin  the  World  Jewish  Con  gress  (WJC)  following  the  surprise  resignation  this  week  of  WJC  presi  dent  Edgar  Bronfman,  after  almost  30  years  at  the  helm.   The  Executive  Council  of  Aus   tralian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  resigned  from  the  WJC  in  2005  amid  concerns  over  that  body’s  governance  processes  and  the  role  of  now-disgraced  former  vice-president  Rabbi  Israel  Singer,  as  well  as  over  a  libel  suit  filed  at  the  time  against  former  Australian  communal  leader  Isi  Leibler,  who  led  the  cam  paign  against  Rabbi  Singer.   ECAJ  president  Grahame  Leonard  told  the  AJN  that  Bronfman’s  depar  ture  opened  up  new  opportunities  for  both  the  WJC  and  the  ECAJ.  ""Hope  fully  this  represents  an  opportunity  for  the  WJC  to  completely  restructure  itself,  including  a  new  constitution  and  a  more  transparent  governance  program.”   Leonard  said  that  it  was  unclear  whether  the  ECAJ  could  simply  renew  its  place  within  the  WJC,  or  whether  there  was  a  more  compli   W1C  president  Edgar  Bronfman...   surprise  resignation  after  almost  30  years  at  the  helm.

In  any  case,  he  said,  “we  look  forward  to  a  dialogue  with  the  new  leadership  in  time,  because  we  believe  Australia  has  a  key  role  to  play  in  the  Asian  region  when  it  comes  to  promoting  Israel  and  other  Jewish  causes”.   Bronfman’s  resignation  capped  weeks  of  turmoil  following  the  firing  of  Rabbi  Singer,  a  longtime  senior  official  at  the  WJC,  as  well  as  other  scandals  afflicting  the  organisation  (see  World  14).   The  WJC  governing  board  will  elect  a  new  president  on  June  10  in  New  York,  officials  said.  The  steering   committee  will  convene  a  nomina  tions  committee  to  consider  candi  dates.   Mendel  Kaplan,  the  South  African  chairman  of  the  WJC  executive,  appears  to  be  the  leading  contender  at  least  as  interim  president,  according  to  sources,  as  is  Ronald  Lauder,  a  phi  lanthropist  and  president  of  the  Jew   ish  National  Fund.   But  according  to  Leibler,  Kaplan   would  be  a  “bizarre”  choice  to  lead  the   WJC,  and  he  urged  the  body  to  cast  a  wider  net  and  look  for  a  leader  totally  “untainted  by  scandal”.   “Kaplan  was  the  principal  lay  offi  cer  who  defended  [Rabbi]  Singer  and  succeeded  in  stifling  any  investigation  of  charges  that  funds  had  been  mis  appropriated  until  the  attorney-gen  eral  forced  an  investigation,”  he  told  the  AJN  from  his  home  in  Jerusalem.   “He  also  led  the  campaign  to  demonise  and  ultimately  expel  all  WJC  officials  who  had  called  for  an  independent  audit.  It  would  be   bizarre  for  this  man  to  head  a   reformed  WJC.   WITH  JTA ",2007-05-11
"  Jewish  voters  not  concerned  by  pulp  mill  decision   JOSHUA  LEVI   MALCOLM  Turnbull’s  decision  to   approve  the  controversial  Tasmanian  pulp  mill  will  not  change  the  voting  intentions  of  Jewish  constituents  in  Wentworth  at  the  forthcoming  Fed   eral  Election.   That’s  the  view  of  local  political  experts  and  voters,  despite  the  thou  sands  of  advertising  dollars  being  spent  on  hard-hitting  campaigns  in   the  local  media.   According  to  Julian  Leeser,  execu  tive  director  of  the  Menzies  Research  Centre,  the  pulp  mill  will  not  be  sig  nificant  in  the  minds  of  Jewish  voters,  but  other  issues,  such  as  the  economy,   will.   “The  key  issue  for  Jews  at  the  elec  tion  is  not  the  pulp  mill.  Broadly  it  is  two  things:  the  first  is  common  to  all  Australians  -  the  question  of  the  economy.  The  other  is  for  Jews  to  have  a  government  that  is  committed  to  our  community  and  to  the  State  of   Israel,”  Leeser  told  The  AJN.   Local  residents  agree,  said  22-year   old  Wentworth  resident  Ronnie   Sternberg,  who  added  the  pulp  mill   will  have  no  effect  on  his  vote.   “Global  warming  and  the  econ  omy  will  have  an  impact  on  my  vote,  but  really  it  will  be  the  candidates’  policies  towards  Israel  and  the  Sydney  Jewish  community.”   His  comments  were  echoed  by  Yvette  Sher,  who  said  the  economy  and  family  issues  would  determine  her  vote.   “I  believe  that  if  we  have  a  change  in  government  it  would  destabilise  the  economy.  I  think  things  are  very  good  as  they  are,”  Sher  said.   Emeritus  professor  Sol  Encel  from  the  Social  Policy  Research  Centre  at  the  University  of  New  South  Wales  agreed  that  the  pulp  mill  was  not  a  major  concern  for  Jewish  voters.  “I  think  people  have  already  made  up  their  minds  whether  they  are  going  to  vote  for  Malcolm  Turnbull  or  not,  and  the  pulp  mill  wouldn’t  have  been   a  major  influence  on  their  decision.”   But  he  disagreed  with  Leesers  comment  that  the  economy  was  the  most  important  election  issue.   “I  don’t  believe  that  argument  [that  people  vote  according  to  eco  nomic  management  issues]  because  if  people  cared  so  much  about  the  economy,  then  the  government  would  be  doing  well  in  the  opinion  polls,”  Encel  said.

With  this  in  mind,  I  approached  the  recently  released  paperback  version  of  Marsha  Bryan  Edelman’s  Discovering  Jewish  Music  and  its  accompanying  CD  with  a  great  sense  of  anticipation  that  this  knowledge  could  be  integrated  and  |  extended.  I  was  mostly  satisfied.   In  one  volume,  Professor  Edelman  pres  I  ents  a  very  readable  history  of  Jewish  |  music,  which  she  defines  as  music  “by  |  Jews,  for  Jews,  as  Jews”.   |  We  all  have  our  own  ideas  of  what  !  Jewish  music  is  for  us:  a  Yiddish  lullaby,  a   good  piece  of  chazanut  based  on  an  old  mi-Sinai  melody  or  a  lively  klezmer  tune.  Edelman  covers  all  these  and  a  lot  more,  explaining  how  they  fit  into  the  big  picture   that  is  Jewish  music.   This  book  is  not  written  for  the  trained  musician,  but  instead  should  appeal  to  anyone  who  is  interested  in  the  beguiling  story  of  how  Jewish  music  has  adapted  arid  developed  over  the  years;  being  affected  by  and,  at  times,  producing  its  own  change  on  the  surrounding  cultures.   Edelman  emphjasises  history  rather  than  music  theory,  setting  each  new  musi  cal  paradigm  in  its  place,  teasing  out  the  reasons  for  changes  in  musical  styles.  The  written  musical  examples  that  illustrate  the  myriad  changes  of  style  that  Jewish  music  has  gone  through  are  brought  to  life  on  the  accompanying  CD.   Jews,  like  all  wandering  peoples,  occa  sionally  found  “new”  tunes  from  local  folk  melodies  and  added  new  lyrics  to  them.  Chassidim  of  Eastern  Europe  even  made  it  a  mission  to  elevate  secular  folk  songs  to  holy  service.  The  passage  of  a  few  tunes  is  followed  through  communities,  noting  how  a  Chassidic  tune  might  aid  up  on  a  Reform  bimah  and  a  Reform  tune  adopted  and  “folklorised”  by  Orthodox  congregations.   The  footnotes  are  extensive  and  com  prise  a  collection  of  stories  about  the  char  acters  that  appear  through  Jewish  musical  history.  They  help  to  draw  you  in  to  the  unfolding  experience.  I  found  myself  need  ing  two  bookmarks  simultaneously,  so  I  wouldn’t  lose  my  place  or  miss  too  much  of  the  drama.  Those  who  feel  like  delving  deeper  into  the  musical  styles  are  rewarded  with  a  thorough  bibliography.   I  would  have  liked  to  hear  on  die  CD  some  of  the  original  klezmer  recordings  from  the  early  part  of  the  last  century  instead  of  just  modem  examples  (though  Edelman  may  have  thought  that  this  aspect  of  Jewish  music  has  received  its  fair  share  of  attention  in  the  last  few  decades  through  the  highly  successful  klezmer  revival)-  There  are  a  few  notewor  thy  omissions,  (no  mention  of  long-run  ning  radio  show  Yiddish  Melodies  In  Swing)  and  some  might  disagree  with  the  weight  ings  given  to  various  styles.  But  Discovering  Jewish  Music  is  definitely  worth  having  on  your  bookshelf  or,  better,  riext  to  your  music  collection.

Rabbi  Levi’s  comments  follow  the  B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Com   mission’s  (ADC’s)  move  to  ask  Catholic  authorities  whether  they  will  use  the  conversion  prayer  in  Australian   churches.

"  PARIS  -  Jean  Sarkozy,  the  son  of  French  President  Nicolas  Sarkozy,  exchanged  wedding  vows  last  week  with  his  school  sweetheart  Jessica  Sebaoun  Darty,  heiress  of  a  Jewish  family  that  founded  one  of  France’s  largest  electrical-goods  retail   chains.   Sarkozy,  who  turned  22  this  month,  and  Sebaoun  Darty,  who  is  in  her  early  20s,  tied  the  knot  at  the  city  hall  in  Neuilly-sur-Seine,  west  of  Paris,  where  Nicolas  Sarkozy  launched  his  political  career  when  he  was  28  years  old.   They  were  engaged  in  June.   According  to  French  media,  Jean  and  Jessica  wanted  only  a  civil  wedding.   Jean  Sarkozy,  a  Sorbonne  law  student  and  amateur  actor,  is  already  an  elected  politician,  sitting  in  the  Hauts-de-Seine  regional  council,  where  he  leads  the  centre  right  UMP  majority.   Jean,  who  is  the  second  son  from  Nicolas  Sarkozy’s  first  marriage  to  Marie-Dominique  Culioli,  the  daughter  of  a  Corsican  chemist,  has  denied  speculation  he  is  planning  to  convert  to  Judaism.   After  his  engagement  in  June,  the  press  reported  that  the  couple   went  to  Israel  “in  order  to  learn  more  about  Jewish  culture”.   Nicolas  Sarkozy  has  Jewish  roots,  as  his  mother  was  bom  to  the  Mallah  family,  one  of  the  oldest  Jewish  families  of  Salonika,  or  Thessaloniki,  in  Greece.   In  July,  a  French  cartoonist  columnist  of  a  satirical  political  magazine  was  fired  by  the  editor  for  writing  anti-Semitic  remarks  towards  Jean  Sarkozy  when  he  sug  gested  that  the  president’s  son,  who  is  a  Catholic,  intended  to  convert  to  Judaism  before  the  marriage.   The  caricaturist  suggested  that  Jean  Sarkozy  was  “an  opportunist  who  would  go  far  in  life”.   Although  the  caricaturist  denied  claims  of  anti-Semitism,  the  maga  zine’s  editor,  Philippe  Val,  said  the  remarks  “could  be  interpreted  as  drawing  a  link  between  conversion  to  Judaism  and  social  success”  -  rehashing  the  old  stereotype  Uniting   Jews  and  money.

"  An  Aboriginal  Jew?  Not  likely   MICHELLE  COLEMAN   HE  captured  our  imaginations  with  his  belligerence  towards  officials,  the  unusual  contents  of  his  luggage  and  his  unlikely  story.  Now  it  appears  that  a  man  claiming  to  be  an  Aborig  inal  Jew  on  Seven  Network’s  Border  Security  program  may  have  been  an  impostor.   On  March  17,  Border  Security  fea  tured  a  man  by  the  name  of  Michael,  who  pushed  ahead  of  the  queues  at  passport  control,  claiming  that,  as  an  Aborigine,  he  did  not  need  to  be  processed.  However,  quarantine  offi  cers  stopped  him  and  insisted  on  checking  his  bags.   Michael  declared  that  his  bags   had  already  been  through  the  highest  security  checks  in  Israel,  where  he  had  been  studying  Jewish  law.  Indeed,  his  bag  did  contain  tra  ditional  Jewish  books  -  along  with  prohibited  items  such  as  nuts,  seeds  and  diseased  leaves.  At  first,  Michael  insisted  he  was  not  beholden  to  quarantine  laws:  “It’s  not  my  law,  it’s  your  law,”  he  said,  and  asked  what  was  wrong  with  the  quarantine  laws  in  1778  when,  he  said,  disease  was  brought  into  Australia  that  con  tributed  to  the  “Aboriginal  geno   cide”.  Michael  also  claimed  he  was  a  lawyer.   Lyndal  Marks,  series  producer  of  Border  Security,  said  she  had  tried  to  follow  up  the  story  and  discovered   Michael  (right),  the  self-described  ""Aboriginal  Jew”  on  Border  Security.

She  doubted  his  claim  of  being  an  Aboriginal  Jew.  “People  say  all  sorts  of  things.  They  also  say  they’ve  got  nothing  prohibited  in  their  bags,  but   of  course  they  do,”  she  said.  Marks  also  said  she  didn’t  believe  it  was  possible  to  confirm  Michael’s  story.   Perhaps  the  only  thing  100  per  cent  Jewish  about  Michael  was  his  chutzpah! ",2008-03-28

I  Roslyn  Hakim  was  one  of  only  120  \  accredited  space  agents  (ASA)  and   future  passengers  from  around  the  t  world,  including  three  from  Australia,   I  to  be  invited.   f  The  group  flew  on  charter  flights  f;  from  Las  Vegas  to  the  Mojave  Desert  [  to  view  the  Virgin  Galactic  [  WhiteNightTwo  mothership,  and  to  if  learn  about  the  passenger  rocket  I  SpaceShipTwo  (SS2)  by  designer  Burt  I  Rutan  and  test  pilot  Brian  Binnie,  1  who  also  took  die  group  into  the  |  flight  simulator.   “It  was  a  most  exciting  moment  for  me,  a  culmination  of  40  years  in  the  travel  industry.  It  was  absolutely  surreal  to  actually  see  the  aircraft  and  touch  it  -  it  was  overwhelming,”  Hakim  told  The  AJN.   “When  I  was  living  in  South  Africa,  it  was  big  news  when  the  [Boeing]  707s  arrived,  and  I  was  part  of  it,  while  working  at  Qantas.  Now  the  future  is  space.  If  you  said  to  me,  a  few  years  ago,  I’d  be  selling  space  tickets  in  my  lifetime,  I  would  never  have  imagined  it  would  happen.”   Hakim  is  a  travel  manager  at  World  Travel  Professionals,  which  was  the  first  travel  agency  in  the  world  to  sign  up  a  traveller  from  Brisbane  on  the  forthcoming  maiden  Virgin  Galactic  space  flight   “It  was  so  exciting,  because  this  was  the  first  of  a  first  It  was  making   history,”  Hakim  said.   Passengers  must  complete  up  to  three  days  of  training  before  being  permitted  to  fly.   WhiteKnightTwo  will  fly  to  around  15  kilometres  where  it  will  release  SS2.  A  few  seconds  later,  SS2  will  fire  its  hybrid  rocket  engine  and  within  10  seconds  will  be  travelling  vertically  out  of  the  earth’s  atmos  phere  at  Mach  3  (three  times  the  speed  of  sound).

The  total  trip,  from  WhiteKnightTwo's  takeoff  to  SS2's  un-powered  landing,  will  last  about  two-and-a-half  hours.

"  A  Paris  rally  against  hate,  In  response  to  the  February  2006  murder  of  llan   Hallml.  Photo:  JTA   Torture  of  French  Jew  echoes  Halimi  horrors   BRETT  KUNE   PARIS  -  French  authorities  are  saying  the  recent  captivity  and  beating  of  a  19-year-old  Jewish  man  in  a  Paris  suburb  was  committed  by  delin  quents,  and  was  related  to  money  and  fueled  by  alcohol.   But  the  Jewish  community  in  Paris  is  instinctively  linking  the  February  incident  to  the  torture  and  murder  two  years  ago  of  llan  Halimi,  a  23-year-old   French  Jewish  man.   “Everyone  is  thinking  about  llan,”.  said  pharmacist  Danielle  Brami.  “People  were  very  scared  when  llan  was  killed,  and  now  this  incident  also  provokes  fear  -  fear  that  Jews  are  in  danger.""   In  last  month’s  incident,  Mathieu  Roumi  was  held  for  nine  hours  in  a  garage  by  six  men  of  various  ethnic  and  religious  backgrounds,  aged  17  to  25.  They  handcuffed  Roumi,  then  beat  and  kicked  him  over  money  he  allegedly  owed  them.   They  then  scribbled  “sale  juif  (dirty  Jew)  with  a  marker  on  his  face  while  making  references  to  Halimi,  who  was  kidnapped  and  tortured  for  three  weeks  before  he  was  dumped  on  the  streets;  Halimi  died  shortly  thereafter.   Roumi  was  held  in  Bagneux,  where   he  and  his  attackers  lived,  and  the  same  suburb  just  south  of  Paris  where  Halimi  was  killed  by  a  gang  calling  itself  The  Barbarians.  More  than  two  dozen  people,  notably  gang  leader  Youssouf  Fofana,  will  go  on  trial  soon  for  Halimi’s  murder.   Unlike  Halimi,  however,  Roumi  knew  his  aggressors  and  went  with  them  voluntarily  to  an  apartment  to  discuss  their  financial  dispute  before  he  was  taken  to  a  nearby  garage.   Jewish  community  officials  say  the  fact  that  an  ordinary  argument  over  money  in  the  neighbourhood  could  escalate  into  a  violent  captivity  with  an  anti-Semitic  nature  is  dangerous.   ""There  is  a  kind  of  banalisation  of  anti-Semitic  acts  going  on  here,""  said  Joel  Mergui,  the  head  of  the  French  Consistoire,  the  Jewish  body  of  reli  gious  affairs.  “These  guys  knew  each  other  from  the  neighbourhood,  but  they  handcuffed  him  for  nine  hours  and  scribbled  ‘dirty  Jew’  on  his  face.""   “It  used  to  be  that  petty  criminal  activity  in  tough  suburbs  stayed  just  that,  but  now  there  is  this  anti-Semitic  element,  and  it  is  scary.  And  Bagneux  is  a  nice  place,  not  at  all  a  ghetto”  said  Parisian  osteopath  Armand   i-unaro.   JTA ",2008-03-14

"  JEWISH  LAWYERS  ON  HICKS   GEORGE  Newhouse  rightfully  insisted  that  David  Hicks’  post-release  statement  “needs  to  go  further  and  renounce  the  hateful  and  deeply  anti-  Semitic  views  he  has  espoused  previ-  ously”  (The  Australian  30/12).  On  the  other  hand,  “dissident  Jewish”  lawyer  Robert  Richter  wrote  in  The  Age  that  Hicks  is  simply  “misguided”  and  oth-   erwise  makes  no  mention  whatsoever  of  Hicks’  anti-Semitism.  It  is  worth  noting  that  Richter  is  a  supporter  of  Antony  Loewenstein’s  anti-Israel  IAJV   statement.   The  contrast  between  the  two  Jew-  ish  lawyers  could  not  be  more  stark   and  leads  me  to  ask;  when  will  some   so-called  “human-rights”  activists  learn  that  supporting  Islamists  and  anti-Semites  and  turning  a  blind  eye  to  many  of  their  actions,  while  condemn-  ing  Israel,  is  not  actually  “progressive”  at  all?  Rather,  it  is  suicidal,  genocidal  and  (for  the  attention  of  learned,  eru-  dite  QCs)  bloody  stupid!   DANIEL  LEWIS  Rushcutters  Bay,  NSW ",2008-01-04
"  JEWISH  GOLF  CLUB   LAST  week,  the  United  Israel  Appeal  (UIA)  advertised  its  fundraiser  golf  day  in  The  AJN,  to  be  held  at  Sand  hurst  Golf  Club  (05/12).  Earlier,  the  Maccabi  Cricket  Club  chose  Southern  Golf  Club  for  its  golf  day.   Both  Sandhurst  and  Southern  are  nice  courses,  but  it  is  not  appropriate  for  a  Jewish  organisation  to  choose   either  venue  ahead  of  the  Cran  boume  Golf  Club.   Cranbourne  Golf  Club  is  generally  known  in  the  golfing  fraternity  as  “the  Jewish  club”,  and  was  formed  out  of  adversity  more  than  50  years  ago  by  Jews  who  were  the  targets  of  preju  dice  and  religious  intolerance.  The  Jewish  founders  created  the  club  to  own  and  protect  the  land  as  a  facility  for  Jewish  golfers.   Upon  formation,  Cranbourne  Golf   Club  made  a  statement  to  the  world:  that  discrimination,  persecution  and  unwarranted  mistrust  are  unaccept  able  in  our  society.  The  Jewish  values   of  Cranbourne’s  founders  live  on   today  and  the  golf  club’s  membership  remains  approximately  40  per  cent  Jewish.  Moreover,  it  is  highly  rated  as  a  championship  course,  having  been  the   venue  for  two  PGA  tournaments.   Some  Jewish  golfers  have  chosen  to  be  members  at  golf  clubs  other  than  Cranbourne.  This  is,  of  course,  their  prerogative,  albeit  difficult  to  under  stand  in  some  cases.  However,  for  Jew  ish  organisations,  such  as  UIA  and  Maccabi  Cricket  Club,  to  choose  to  overlook  Cranbourne  -  with  its  Jew   ish  history  and  record  -  in  preference  for  another  golfing  venue  is  short  sighted,  and  we  believe  unacceptable.   In  order  for  Cranbourne  Golf  Club  to  continue  to  provide  an  exam  ple  of  proper  behaviour  for  all  peo  ples,  it  is  imperative  that  Jewish  sportspeople  continue  to  support  it.

I  am  a  firm  believer  in  having  a  strong  Jewish  identity.  I  would  like  my  children  to  go  to  a  Jewish  day  school  and  have  the  same  opportunity  I  had,  and  still  form  their  own  Jewish  identity.  I  would  also  like  to  take  my  children  to  shul  as  often  as  possible,  in  order  to  show  them  the  importance  of  prayer  and  religion  within  a  modern-day  world  where  religious  belief  and  reli  gious  course  is  constantly  changing.   Basis!  I  definitely  want  my  kids  to  have  the  same  experience  as  I  did  growing  up.  Awareness  of  the  main  holidays,  Friday  night  dinners,  that  sort  of  thing.  I  probably  wouldn’t  do  too  much  differently.   GoEdbeig:  I  certainly  hope  to  maintain  some  involvement  in  the  community  through  sporting  and/or  charitable  organisations.   Gelbart:  Yes,  I  would  like  to  get  involved  in  a  wider  variety  of  Jewish  organisations  and  within  Jewish  edu  cation  in  general.   Are  people  your  age   concerned  about  the  Jewish  community  they  live  in?   Fain:  I  think  people  are  concerned  to  an  extent  They  are  concerned  socially  -  in  terms  of  Jewish  friends  and  dat  ing  -  but  I’m  not  so  sure  how  others  feel  about  the  community.   Michaels:  Many  people  my  age  respect  the  Jewish  culture  and  wish  to  preserve  it  as  best  they  can  and  in   their  own  traditional  ways.  They  wish  to  sustain  and  build  Jewish  awareness  by  keeping  to  the  traditions  that  they  have  been  brought  up  with  in  their  families.  In  addition,  many  of  us  had  grandparents,  and  other  ancestors,   who  survived  the  Holocaust  and  want   to  pass  on  their  stories  for  generations  to  come,  so  they  are  not  forgotten.   Harrison:  I  hope  so.  It  won’t  be  long  before  we’ll  be  obligated  to  lead  the  community,  so  I  hope  interest  doesn’t   wane  in  the  interim.   Mettz:  Certainly.  Since  I  have  gradu  ated  from  Moriah,  there  has  been  a  complete  paradigm  shift  in  the  way  being  Jewish  is  perceived  by  people.  There  is  also  a  difference  in  the  way  the  “new”  generation  of  the  Jewish  community  behave.  I  think  this  has  caused  a  lot  of  angst  and  disbelief  in  the  current  young  adult  community.   Baslsfc  I  think  the  community  is  in  a  good  state.  We  have  a  thriving  Jewish  community  in  Melbourne.   Goldberg:  Most  of  my  friends  are  involved  in  the  community  in  some  capacity.   Gelbart  Not  really.   If  you  could  change  one  thing  in  the  Jewish   community,  what  would  it  be,  and  why?   Fain:  I  think  this  community  is  a  little  all  over  the  place.  For  example,  a  lot  of  parents  send  their  kids  to  expensive  Jewish  day  schools,  but  at  the  end  of  die  day,  the  home  is  where  half  the   education  comes  from  and  it  seems   parents  rely  on  the  fact  that  Jewish  upbringing  will  be  handled  only  by  the  schools.  There’s  not  enough  focus  on  everything  we  are,  everything  we  have  achieved,  and  the  richness  of  our  religion,  our  culture  and  heritage.  Sometimes,  we’re  too  focused  on  our  survival,  instead  of  celebrating  what  we  are.  No  wonder  there’s  a  Jewish  identity  crisis.   Michaels:  I  would  try  to  somehow   bridge  the  social  and  cultural  divide  between  various  Jewish  groups  within  our  community  -  for  example  -  between  ultra-Orthodox,  religious  and  secular  Jews.  In  addition,  between  newly  arrived  immigrants  and  other  Jewish  locals.   Harrison:  I  think  the  bigger  shuls  need  to  engage  members  of  the  commu  nity  more  -  people  my  age,  in  partic  ular,  and  the  entire  community,  as  a  whole,  as  well.  A  few  of  the  shuls  seem  to  be  starting  to  push  in  that  direc  tion,  which  is  great  I  look  forward  to  seeing  the  outcome  of  their   initiatives.   Mettz:  Attitude.  There  is  a  problem  with  the  attitude  of  the  new  genera  tion  of  Jews.  Being  Jewish  isn’t  “cool”.  The  reality  is,  it  may  not  be  -  but  Judaism  and  being  Jewish  is  up  to  us.  This  young  generation  has  to  realise   we  are  all  we  have.  If  our  attitudes  to  Judaism  fall  out  of  existence,  then  so  do  our  cultures,  beliefs  and  traditions.  We  have  to  look  out  for  ourselves.   Our  religion,  as  a  whole,  is  only  as   sustainable  as  we  make  it  We  are  a   minority  and  for  it  to  function,  we  all  have  to  be  on  the  same  page.   Baslst  There’s  not  a  lot  I  would   change,  it  is  a  big  part  of  my  life.  I  would  hope  that  we  could  integrate  into  the  wider  community  a  bit  more  and,  in  turn,  I  hope  that  community  is  a  bit  more  tolerant  towards  us.   Goldberg:  Instil  a  greater  sense  of  community  and  humility  in  our  young  people.  At  the  moment,  people  (myself  included)  seem  to  take  many  aspects  of  the  community  for  granted.   Gelbart*  Having  all  the  Jewish  organi  sations  more  structured  and  organ  ised  together,  so  that  they  are  all  able  to  function  professionally,  efficiently  and  with  maximum  results.  It  would  allow  a  more  united  Jewish  community. ",2008-10-17

"  BEFORE  the  Jewish  community’s  mass  migration  to  Israel  in  1950  and  1951,  Baghdadi  Jews,  Muslims  and  Christians  worked  together  in  a  productive  intellectual  environment.  Two  memoirs,  last  year  pub  lished  in  English,  conjure  scenes  of  multi  religious  gatherings  of  young  thinkers  in  the  coffee  houses  along  the  Tigris,  discussing  the  merits  or  otherwise  of  Iraqi  commu  nism;  families  on  mid-river  islands  enjoying  Masgouf,  the  fish  flame-grilled  straight  from  the  water;  and  the  everyday  tragedies  and  triumphs  of  a  2000-year-old  community  that  exists  only  between  the  pages  of  the  books.

"  JEWISH  NEWS     AUSTRALIA  DAY  PRIDE     AN  upsurge  in  national  pride  has  meant  that  Australia  Day  has   become  one  of  our  more  relevant  and  celebrated,  national  days.  Whether  a  barbecue  at  the  beach,  a  game  of  backyard  cricket  or  simply  flying  the  flag,  Australians  are  being  exhorted  to  do  some-  thing  “Aussie”  to  celebrate  the  220th  anniversary  of  white  settlement  in  our  home  country.   It  also  happens  to  be  Shabbat,  which  will  affect  the  way  some  in  the  Jew-  ish  community  will  celebrate  the  day.  However,  it  also  offers  the  chance  for  a  “fair  dinkum”  prayer  of  thanks  for  this  country  and  the  wonderful  oppor-  tunities  it  has  afforded  us.  We  are  fortunate  to  live  a  rich  and  fulfilling  Jew-  ish  life,  while  participating  equally  in  every  aspect  of  Australian  society.   Australia  Day  is  as  good  a  time  as  any  to  reflect  on  what  we,  as  Jews,  want  for  Australia.  We  want  a  kinder  and  gentler  nation  than  what  emerged  at  times  under  the  previous  government  We  want  more  tolerance  and  more  understanding  that  “multiculturalism”  isn’t  necessarily  a  dirty  word.   Our  community,  like  many  comprised  of  immigrants  and  their  sons  and  daughters,  juggles  loyalty  to  this  nation  with  loyalty  to  another  abroad.  We  are  probably  better  at  appropriately  celebrating  Israel  and  supporting  its  causes  than  some  communities,  whose  occasional  excessive  displays  of  national  pride  -  particularly  at  sporting  events  -  have  created  headlines  at   home  and  around  the  world   But  we  do  face  a  big  and  exciting  year,  living  in  Australia  but  taking  part  in  what  promises  to  be  a  wonderful  series  of  events  to  mark  Israel’s  60th  birthday.  The  countdown  to  that  milestone  is  on  in  earnest  and  there  is  much  to  look  forward  to,  before,  during  and  even  after  Yom  Ha’atzmaut.   But  the  fact  that  we  can  wear  our  blue-and-white  hearts  on  our  sleeves,  without  raising  the  ire  of  our  fellow  Australians  and  without  accusations  of  conflicting  loyalties  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  Australia  is  such  a  magnificent  country,  and  something  worth  contemplating  this  weekend  when  asked  what  Australia  Day  means  to  you.

"  NO  JEWISH  CONSPIRACY   IN  an  refreshing  and  much-needed  analysis  piece  published  in  the  The  Australian  (04/06)  ,The  Times  US  edi  tor  Gerard  Baker  addressed  the  myth  that,  in  US  politics,  the  Israel  lobby  “uses  the  financial  and  political  muscle  of  American  Jews  to  exercise  a  stran  glehold  on  foreign  policy  debate”.   He  explains,  “AIPAC  [the  American  Israel  Public  Affairs  Committee]  is  undoubtedly  one  of  the  most  effective  lobbying  organisations  in  Washington.  But  it  succeeds  because  very  large  numbers  of  Americans  share  its  aims,  not  because  it  somehow  strongarms  politicians  into  supporting  it.  Candi  dates  want  AlPAC’s  approval  because  they  know  that  being  seen  as  pro-Israel  is  central  to  their  foreign  policy  creden  tials.  In  opinion  polls,  Americans  express  overwhelming  support  for  Israel.  They  see  it  in  kindred  terms  -  a  thriving  democracy  forged  in  an  inhos  pitable  climate.""

"  Jewish  golf  dilemma   HOW  do  you  define  a  Jewish  sporting  dub:  On  one  hand,  there  are  the   dubs  that  are  affiliated  with  Maccabi.  Their  criteria  for  membership  is  simple  -  you  need  to  be  Jewish.  The  rule  of  thumb  at  Maccabi  has  long  been  that  if  you  have  a  Jewish  parent,  then  you  are  in.   Maccabi’s  membership  rules  have  never  been  tested  in  a  court  of  law,  but  are  based  on  equal  opportunities  legislation  designed  to  help  preserve  minority  cul  tures.  Then  there  are  the  dubs  that  aren’t  Jewish,  as  such,  but  have  large  and  -  in  some  cases—majority  Jewish  membership  bases,  such  as  the  Cranboume  and  Monash  golf  dubs,  as  well  as  various  lawn  bowls  dubs  in  Melbourne,  Sydney   and  Perth.   Cranboume’s  role  in  the  Melbourne  Jewish  community  is  being  debated  after  two  Jewish  organisations,  the  Maccabi  AJAX  Cricket  Club  (past  players)  and  Young  United  Israel  Appeal  staged  fundraising  golf  days  at  other  local  golf   courses.   Both  sides  have  valid  points.  While  not  offidally  a  Jewish  dub,  Cranboume  was  started  more  than  50  years  ago  by  Jewish  golfers,  who  were  pretty  much  exduded  from  every  decent  private  course  in  Melbourne.  Today,  Jews  make  up  between  30  and  40  per  cent  of  the  membership.   Nevertheless,  the  landscape  has  changed  markedly.  Golf,  in  general,  is  struggling.  It  is  said  that  cycling  has  become  the  new  golf,  so  golf  dubs  are  casting  their  net  far  and  wide  for  members,  and  younger  Jews,  in  particular,  have  accepted  invitations  to  join  clubs  far  more  inclusive  than  those  of  gener  ations  past   Should  Jewish  golf  days  be  staged  at  the  traditional  Jewish  courses?  Proba  bly.  It  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  Jewish  members  of  these  clubs  are  long  standing  and  generous  supporters  of  the  same  Jewish  groups,  who  are  staging  the  golf  days.  And  doing  so  would  send  a  strong  message  of  “looking  after  our   own”.   But  we  do  take  issue  with  those  who  paint  Jewish  golfers,  who  choose  to  play  elsewhere,  as  ""disloyal”..Anecdotal  evidence  would  suggest  that  those  who  can  afford  the  four-figure  sum  to  join  expensive  golf  dubs  can  and  do  support  the  wider  Jewish  community  and  its  myriad  causes.   That  the  doors  of  one-time  exclusionary  golf  courses  are  now  open  to  Jews  should  be  greeted  with  joy,  not  suspidon.  It  is  called  progress. ",2008-12-19
"  Authorities  arrest  eight  suspects  in  Yemenite  Jew’s  murder   ROEE  NAHM  {AS   SANAA  -  Yemenite  authorities  arrested  eight  suspects  in  connection   with  the  murder  of  Moshe  Yaish  Nahari,  a  Jewish  resident  of  Riydah,  Israel  Radio  reported  on  Saturday.   Sources  said  that  Thursday’s  killing  was  likely  to  have  been  reli  giously  motivated,  but  that  other  motives  were  still  possible  and  there  fore  an  investigation  would  continue.   On  Friday,  Yemeni  police  arrested  a  suspected  Muslim  extremist,  Abed  el-Aziz  el-Abadi,  a  former  MiG-29  pilot  in  Yemen’s  air  force,  for  allegedly  shooting  Nahari,  the  brother  of  a  prominent  rabbi  in  Yemen.   Eyewitnesses  told  the  newspaper   that  el-Abadi  had  confronted  the  39   year-old  Nahari  at  the  market  in  Riydah,  called  out  to  him:  “Jew,  accept  the  message  of  Islam”,  and  then  pro  ceeded  to  open  fire  with  a  Kalash   nikov  assault  rifle.  Nahari  was  struck  by  five  bullets.   Most  of  Yemen’s  roughly  400  remaining  Jews  live  in  Riydah.  The  poor  country,  at  the  southern  tip  of  the  Arabian  peninsula,  once  had  tens  of  thousands  of  Jews,  but  most  have  emigrated.   Haviv  Nahari,  the  victim’s  brother  in-law  who  resides  in  Ashkelon,  said  that  the  family  was  in  “total  shock”  upon  hearing  of  Yaish’s  murder.   “We  spoke  to  him  just  last  Saturday  and  asked  him  how  his  family  was  doing,”  Haviv  said,  adding:  “We  knew   there  was  anti-Semitism  in  Yemen,   but  I  never  imagined  someone  would  take  a  rifle  and  murder  a  Jew  on  the  street  in  broad  daylight”   According  to  Haviv,  three  years  ago  his  sister  and  her  husband  decided  to  make  aliyah  after  visiting   Israel  a  few  times.   “They  sold  their  house  and  we   Yemenite  Jews  celebrate  a  Passover  seder.

"  Acting  Jewish,  directing  gentile   DON  PERLGUT   WITH  last  week’s  death  of  Sydney   Pollack  at  age  73,  we  have  lost  not  only  one  of  the  world’s  great  Jewish  directors  and  producers,  but  a  great  Jewish  character  actor.  Very  few  individuals  have  achieved  consistent  and  great  success  in  all  three  roles,  but  Pollack  did.   Scott  Eyman  of  The  Palm  Beach  Post  describes  Pollack  as  “acting  Jewish  and  directing  gentile”.  This  might  explain  why  he  did  so  well  with  The  Way  We  Were,  which  starred  Robert  Redford  and  Barbra  Streisand  as  temperamentally  unsuited  lovers.   Redford  effortlessly  played  Hubbell  Gardiner,  an  emotionally  uptight  gentile  guy  who  is  attracted  to  -  but  also  repelled  by  -  Streisand’s  fiercely  passionate  and  fiery  Jewish  character  (Katie  Morosky).  Take  the  following  exchange  between  them:   Katie:  “It’s  because  I’m  not  attractive  enough,  isn’t  it?  I’m  not  fishing,  really.  I’m  not.  I  know  I’m  attractive,  sort  of.  But  I’m  not  attractive  in  the  right  way,  am  I?  I  mean,  I  don’t  have  the  right  style  for  you.  Do  I?”   Hubbell:  “No.  You  don’t  have  the  right  style.”   Katie:  “I’ll  change.”   Hubbell:  “No,  don’t  change.  Be  your  own  girl.”   Katie:  “Why  can’t  I  have  you?”   Hubbell:  “Because  you  push  too  hard  ...  There’s  no  time  to  relax  and  enjoy  living.”   These  words  were  written  by  Jewish  scriptwriter  Arthur  Laurents,  based  on  his  novel.  But  in  bringing  them  so  evocatively  to  the  screen,  Pollack  successfully  captured  the  emoting  Jewish  woman/goyishe  guy  dilemma  in  a  way  no  other  film  has  before  or  since.   Redford  starred  in  seven  more  of  Pollack’s  films.  According  to  David  Edelstein  in  The  New  York  Post,  their  ease  at  collaborating  arose  from  Pollack’s  background  -  the  Jew  who  grew  up  in  “decidedly  non-Jewish  Indiana  ...  who  clearly  didn’t  want  to  make  movies  with  a  lot  of  ethnic  pushiness”.   Aside  from  The  Way  We  Were,  I  particu  larly  loved  Tootsie,  where  Pollack’s  “cool”  directorial  style  ran  directly  up  against   Pollack  (right)  with  George  Clooney  in  the  Oscar-nominated  Michael  Clayton.   Dustin  Hoffman’s  histrionics.  The  behind  camera  creative  tension  in  this  film  is  beauti   fully  reflected  in  the  hilarious  but  touching  on-screen  exchanges  between  Hoffman  as  the  cross-dressing  actor  Michael  Dorsey/Dorothy  Michaels,  and  Pollack  as  his  bemused  Jewish  agent  George  Fields.   Despite  his  good  and  occasionally  great  films,  it  is  Pollack  the  person  -  the  actor  on  screen,  the  unmistakeably  Jewish  persona  -  who  I  and  millions  of  others  will  remember.  Pollack’s  characters  are  almost  always  iden  tifiably  Jewish  in  a  way  that  reminds  me  of  my  American-Jewish  uncles  -  or  perhaps  my  ideal  vision  of  them:  wise,  intelligent,  witty,   urbane  and  handsome.   Other  Jewish  roles  include  Victor  Ziegler  in  Eyes  Wide  Shut  (to  many,  the  best  thing  about  this  flawed  film),  Marty  Bach  in  Michael  Clayton,  Dick  Mellon  in  The  Player  and  an  uncredited  role  as  Meryl  Streep’s  doctor  in  Death  Becomes  Her.   To  get  your  biggest  dose  of  Pollack,  how  ever,  watch  him  deliver  a  powerful  perform  ance  in  Woody  Allen’s  Husbands  and  Wives,   where  he  plays  the  partner  of  Australian  actor  Judy  Davis.   1  saw  Pollack  in  person  once,  when  he  came  to  Australia  in  1999  to  promote  Random  Hearts,  the  second  of  his  two  films  with  Harrison  Ford.  In  person  he  was  every  thing  that  I  had  seen  on  screen,  but  also  appeared  to  be  a  little  embarrassed  about  all  of  the  attention  focused  on  him.   Pollack  will  continue  to  “haunt”  us  for  a  long  time  to  come  -  he  can  currently  be  seen  in  Australian  cinemas  playing  Patrick  Dempsey’s  father  in  Made  of  Honour,  and  Michael  Clayton  has  just  been  released  on   DVD.   But  Pollack,  prolific  and  hardworking  to  the  end,  has  also  co-produced  two  films  with  Jewish  characters  and  contexts  that  are  due  to  be  released  later  this  year:  The  Reader,  directed  by  Stephen  Daldry  (The  Hours')  from  the  acclaimed  Bernhard  Schlink  novel;  and  Margaret,  directed  by  Kenneth  Lonergan  and  starring  Anna  Paquin  as  Lisa  Cohen.

"  Jew  at  head  of  state’s  Masonic  movement   CHAMALABVTBOL   DR  Greg  Levenston  has  become  the  second  Jew  in  the  120-year  history  of  the  state’s   Masonic  movement  to  be   elected  grand  master  of  the  United  Grand  Lodge  of  NSW  and  the  ACT  (UGLNSW).   About  400  people  turned  out  last  Sunday  to  witness  the  occasion  in  a  ceremony  led  by  Rabbi  Jeremy  Lawrence  at  The  Great  Synagogue.   “Masonic  lore  traces  a  line   back  to  the  great  craftsmen  who  built  that  original  temple  for  King  Solomon,”  Rabbi  Lawrence  told  the  gathering.  “Freemasons  today  may  not  construct  physical  structures,  but  study  of  Masonic  tech  niques,  and  symbolic  learning,  the  set-square  for  accuracy  and  rectitude  ...  provide  the  foun  dation  stones...  of  wisdom,  just  and  ethical  living,  charity  and  social  responsibility”   Dr  Levenston  later  said  that   Dr  Greg  Levenston...  new  leader  of  The  United  Grand  Lodge  of  NSW   and  the  ACT.   being  a  Mason  had  given  a  “special  dimension”  to  his  Jew  ishness  and  life.  “Both  combine  to  provide  me  with  inspiration  in  all  I  do,”  he  added.   Freemasonary  is  one  of  the   world’s  oldest  secular  societies   and  is  founded  on  the  princi  ples  of  integrity,  goodwill  and  charity.

"  APATHY  OF  JEWISH  YOUTH   I  HAVE  recently  come  across  an  article  in  The  Jerusalem  Post,  entitled  “Wake-Up  Call”,  written  by  Samuel   Freedman.   He  refers  to  the  apathy  or  indiffer  ence  of  American  Jewry.  “There  is  something  depressing  about  the  mass  slaughter  in  Israel  to  stir  the  feelings  of  American  Jews,”  he  writes.  Which  brought  me  to  think  about  our  own  young  people  here.   I  am  constantly  disappointed  by  the  lack  of  attendance  of  our  younger  generation  at  different  functions.  I  recently  attended  a  “solidarity  evening”,  with  a  lecture  given  by  Amotz  Asa-El,  an  Israeli  political  commentator.  The  evening  was  extremely  hot  and  it  was  attended  only  by  elderly  people  with  walking  sticks,  or  pushers  -  but  they  were  there,  bravely  beating  the  extreme   heat.   A  very  moving  tribute  was  made  to  the  latest  murder  of  the  yeshivah  boys  in  Jerusalem,  with  photos  and  a  brief  family  story  of  each  boy.  A  candle  was  lit  in  their  memory.  But  were  the  young  people  there?  What  does  it  take  for  us  to  express  our  soli  darity  with  our  brethren?  Is  attending  different  dinners,  fashion  parades  or  just  paying  memberships  enough?   I  seldom  see  members  of  organisa  tions  attending  those  solidarity  fimc   tions,  besides  the  hardworking  office  girls  selling  tickets  at  the  entrance.   And  here  I  would  like  to  applaud  Philip  Chester,  who  is  always  present,  whether  here  or  in  Sydney,  and  delivers  very  intelligent  reports.  Well  done,  Philip!

"  Helping  define  Jewish  status   decision  by  the  rabbinical  Moetzah  of  the  Union  for  Progressive  Judaism  (UPJ)  at  its  conference  last  week  to  standardise  the  status  of  H  congregants  deemed  to  be  bom  Jewish  because  they  have  a  Jewish  father  will  bring  relief  to  some  members  of  the  region’s  24  congregations.   The  12  rabbis  of  the  Progressive  Moetzah  decided  that  any  congregant  deemed  Jewish  by  patrilineal  descent  at  any  of  its  congregations  will  now  automatically  be  recognised  as  Jewish  by  all  of  these  congregations.   This  recognition  means  that  Progressive  Jews,  who  fell  into  this  category,  will  be  able  to  move  to  another  congregation  without  fearing  they  will  no  longer  be  recognised  as  Jews.   The  reason  for  the  anomalies  is  that  in  recognising  that  Jewish  status  can  be  attained  through  patrilineal,  as  well  as  matrilineal  descent,  a  quarter-of  a-century  ago,  the  Australian  Progressive  movement  did  not  do  so  in  a  uni  form  way.   Instead,  different  congregations  applied  different  tests.   The  Moetzah  has  made  it  clear  that  standardised  recognition  of  congregants  is  retroactive  and  does  not  apply  to  those  who  have  not  already  been  recognised  as  Jewish  by  a  UPJ  congregation.   The  move  will  be  welcomed  by  people  who  already  accept  that  Jewishness  can  be  gained  through  the  father’s  status.  And  to  those  who  don’t,  it  is  a  moot  point  Matrilineal  descent  is  a  precept  that  has  long  governed  Jewish  lineage,  and  one  of  the  arguments  for  it  is  that  it  defines  the  status  of  a  Jewish  child,  as  there  can  sometimes  be  doubt  about  who  is  the   father.   Broadly  speaking,  the  embrace  of  patrilineal  descent  by  Progressive  Jews  has  had  the  intended  effect  of  bringing  a  significant  number  of  disenfranchised  people  into  the  Jewish  community,  since  it  was  adopted  in   Australia  and  the  US.   For  worldwide  Jewry,  fighting  a  demographic  battle  for  decades,  this  has  been  a  critical  step,  opening  the  doors  to  people  who,  at  the  very  least,  have  a  family  link  to  Judaism.   Of  course,  as  the  status  of  so-called  patrilineal  Jews  is  not  recognised  by  Orthodox  Jews,  Progressive  rabbis  have  ensured  that  such  people  who  are  welcomed  as  Jews  in  their  congregations  know  where  they  stand  in  the  broader  Progressive  community.  This  is  important  because  it  affects  these  individuals,  when  it  comes  to  marriage  and  children. ",2008-11-07

"  BRITISH  JEWISH   POPULATION  RISING   LONDON  -  The  Jewish  population  in  Britain  grew  for  the  first  time  since  World  War  II,  University  of  Manchester  researchers  said.

"  HUNT  FOR  THE  JEWISH  VOTE   WITH  the  upcoming  elections,  our  local  Hunter  Ward  of  Waverley  is  showing  a  number  of  new  faces  and  the  majority  of  these  seem  to  be  Jew   ish.  Labor  have  offered  us  Lorin  Blu  menthal  as  their  second.  Unfortunately,  this  would  mean  more  than  50  per  cent  of  the  vote  in  sup  port  of  labor  in  order  for  her  to  have  a  chance  (25  per  cent  for  each  candi   date  to  make  quota).  I,  for  one,  wish  her  luck...  but  is  this  feasible  in  light  of  the  current  swing  against  the  Labor  Government  throughout  the  coun  try?   One  has  to  wonder  if  Labor  really  thinks  it  they  can  pull  off  such  a  large  support  base  as  to  realistically  offer  her  a  seat  at  council.  Likewise,  the  Liberals,  in  their  literature,  have  offered  an  ex-South  African  in  Sally  Betts,  and  Yvonne  Cobum  on  the  board  of  Moriah,  as  well  as  Stan  Kruss  who  “has  been  on  the  board  of  the  Australia-Israel  Chamber  of  Com  merce”  (AJN  29/08).  One  would  think  this  was  the  trifecta.  Having  had  personal  dealings  with  Sally  Betts,  I   have  found  her  to  be  a  woman  of  her  word  and  an  effective  councillor,  but  I  need  to  wonder  what  the  rest  of  the  non-Jewish,  non-ex-South  African  electorate,  is  thinking.

Miriam  has  long  been  involved  in  the  fight  against   anti-Semitism  and  anti-Israel  senti   ment,  lobbying  both  media  and  gov  ernment  on  all  levels  for  many  years.

"  SYDNEY  JEWISH  WRITERS  FESTIVAL   Carr,  Mendelsohn  tackle  Jewish  issues  at  SJWF   LEX)  LANDSMAN   PENETRATING  questions  abounded  at  last  week’s  Sydney  Jewish  Writers  Festival  (SJWF)  gala  event  when  pan  ellists  American  award-winning   author  Daniel  Mendelsohn  and  former  NSW  premier  and  author   Bob  Carr  went  head-to-head.   Throughout  the  event,  the  two  authors  debated  a  number  of  Jewish  issues  that  arise  regularly,  both  in  the  literary  world  and  in  Jewish  texts,  including  tackling  anti-Semitism  inherent  in  world  famous  literary  texts.   Author  Alan  Gold  chaired  the   event  and  posed  the  opening  ques  tion:  “Is  the  Jewish  experience  just   another  ethnic  narrative  or  is  there   something  intrinsic  in  it,  which  makes  Jewish  people  unique?”   “There  have  been  other  genocides  and  I  think  we  have  to  acknowledge  the  genocide  that  colonialism  pro  duced  that  may  have  sprinkled  across  Europe  about  eliminating  inferior  races,”  Carr  said,  adding  that  there  was  something  that  goes  “right  to  the  heart”  about  what  happened  to  the  Jews  during  the  Holocaust   “It  reminds  us  that  anti-Semitism  has  resided  in  western  civilisation   going  back  even  before  Christianity  ...

Mendelsohn,  who  is  author  of  The  Lost:  A  Search  for  Six  of  Six  Million,  took  a  different  approach  to  the  ques  tion,  and  said  that  Jews  as  writers  were  in  a  unique  position  because  they  had  paradoxically  both  been  authoritative  in  literature  and  yet  also  consistently  persecuted.   “To  have  this  esteemed  status,  which  everyone  acknowledges,  even  the  Germans,  and  yet  always  to  be  hunted  down,  positions  Jews  in  a  very  interesting  way  in  world  culture.  I  think   that  makes  us  a  people  of  writers.”   Peta  Jones  Pellach,  director  of  adult  education  at  the  Shalom  Insti  tute,  said:  “Mendelsohn  comes  from  a  Jewish  background  and  Bob  Carr  is  not  Jewish  at  all,  but  yet  what  they  said  resonated  with  all  of  us  Jews.”   More  than  300  people  attended  the  gala  event,  which  was  held  in  the  law  theatre  at  the  University  of  New  South  Wales,  and  close  to  400  attended  the  writers’  sessions  held  over  the  three-day  festival.   “I  was  amazed  to  get  such  glowing  comments  of  praise  from  people,  it’s  well  beyond  my  expectations”  said  SJWF  co-ordinator  Elaine  Black.  “We’re  all  buoyed  up  for  the  next  one   in  2010.” ",2008-08-22
"  ROME  -  Ahead  of  a  papal  trip  to  the  United  States,  the  Vatican  has  expressed  its  respect  and  esteem  for  Jews,  despite  tension  over  a  Good  Friday  prayer  revived  by  Pope  Bene   dict  XVI.   In  a  statement,  the  Holy  See  tried  to  reassure  Jews  on  Friday  that  a  new  prayer  that  some  saw  as  a  call  for  their  conversion  did  not  indicate   a  change  in  the  Church’s  high  regard  for  Jews  or  its  condemnation  of  anti-Semitism.   “Hie  Holy  See  wishes  to  reassure   that  the  new  formulation  of  the  prayer...  in  no  way  intends  to  indicate  a  change  in  the  Catholic  Church’s  regard  for  the  Jews,  which  has  evolved   from  die  basis  of  die  Second  Vatican  Council,”  the  statement  said.   The  Vatican  issued  the  document   a  week  before  the  German  pope  is  scheduled  to  begin  a  landmark  visit  to  the  United  States,  which  will  include  a  visit  to  Park  East  syna   gogue  in  New  York  and  a  meeting  with  leaders  of  the  American  Jewish  community.   Some  Jewish  groups  had  said  they  were  disappointed  over  the  prayer  because  it  had  historically   been  used  as  an  excuse  for  violence   and  discrimination  against  Jews.   Catholic  and  Jewish  sources  said  the  Vatican  statement  had  been  delivered  to  Israel’s  chief  rabbinate.   A  major  Jewish  group,  the  Amer  ican  Jewish  Committee  (AJC),  wel  comed  the  Vatican  statement   “We  welcome  this  reaffirmation   of  Nostra  Aetate’s  binding  authority  and  its  requirement  of  esteem  for  and  solidarity  with  the  Jewish  people,”  said  Rabbi  David  Rosen,  die  AJC’s  international  director  of  interreligious  affairs.

And,  like  most  people,  I  was  enthralled  by  documentary  sefies  Who  Do  Yqu  Think  You  Are?.   In  case  you  are  still  one  of  the  chosen  people  not  chosen  to  get  SBS  reception,  the  premise  for  the  show  is  this:  broadcasters,  actors,  authors,  sporting  legends  (basically  people  that  earn  more  money  than  most  people  reading  this  article  -  come  on,  you  know  you’re  not  that  rich!)  go  back  to  their  roots  to  discover  their  true  ancestry.   What  fascinated  me  was  the  amount  of  entities  discovering  they  have  Jewish  blood.  It  would  seem  our  most  exciting  high-profile  addition  to  the  Jewish  race  is  none  other  than  renowned  Australian  jour  nalist  Ita  Buttrose.  Welcome  to  the  mish  pocha,  Ita.  You’re  gonna  love  it,  but  be  prepared  to  put  on  about  three  stone  and  discover  ailments  you  didn’t  know  existed.   But  how  could  this  be?  Doesn’t  Ms  Buttrose  embody  all  that  is  Anglo-Saxon?  The  perpetual  blonde  hair,  the  English  Rose  complexion,  the  love  of  soft  pastels.  Mind  you,  her  trace  elements  of  Jewish  blood  could  explain  her  love  for  women’s  gossip  and  even  suing  a  builder.  (It  doesn’t  get  more  Jewish  than  that!).   I  have  had  the  pleasure  of  meeting  Ita  (Surely  you  remember  me,  Ms  Buttrose?)  and  I’ve  got  to  hand  it  to  her,  the  broad’s  got  a  wonderful  sense  of  humour.  Could  it  be  her  Jewish  blood  that  is  responsible  for  this?   The  UK  series  of  Who  Do  You  Think  You   Are?  revealed  that  celebrity  chef  Nigella  Lawson  is,  in  fact,  Jewish.  This  could  explain  her  large  tuches  and  the  need  to  spend  hours  in  the  kitchen.   As  I’ve  stated  before,  being  Jewish  is   great,  but  I  wonder  if  I  was  to  go  climb  my  genealogical  tree  what  other  cultural  and  religious  branches  I  might  discover.   I  love  Mongolian  lamb  and  I  am  com-:,  pelled  to  eat  yum  cha  every  Sunday.  Could  I,,  in  fact,  have  Chinese  blood?  And,  after  a  comedy  gig,  busting  rny  butt  on  the  stage,  there  is  nothing  better  than  throwing  back  a  couple  of  vodkas.  Could  Russian  ancestry;   be  the  reason  for  this?   he  UK  series  of  Who  Do  v  Think  You  Are?   revealed  that  celebrity   chef  Nigella  Lawson  is  in  fact  Jewish.  This  could  explain  her  large  tuche;  and  the  need  to  spend  hours  in  the  kitchen.   And  here’s  a  real  mystery  that  Who  Do  You  Think  You  Are?  might  help  me  unravel.  At  Easter  time  -  and  this  is  going  to  sound  peculiar  -  all  I  want  to  do  is  eat  chocolate.  Maybe  I  possess  trace  elements  of  Christianity.  How  else  could  you  explain   such  behaviour?   And,  as  for  Christmas,  don’t  get  me  started!  All  I  want  to  do  is  decorate  -my  apartment  in  kitsch,  exchange  gifts  that  my  non-Jewish  friends  have  given  me  and  overeat.  On  second  thoughts,  those  are  definitely  Jewish  traits.   So  SBS,  congratulations  on  another  won  derful  insightful  series.

Suzanne  Terkel  recently  con  fronted  the  wife  of  a  leader  of  the  Cel  ebrate  Messiah  Australia   congregation,  when  she  saw  her  painting  the  fingernails  of  an  elderly  relative  at  the  facility.   “I  am  appalled  that  this  was  allowed  to  happen”,  Terkel  told  The  AJN.  “How  they  can  allow  them  into  the  Smorgon  unit,  to  be  with  people   who  are  near  the  end  of  their  life,  is  just  appalling.”   Rabbi  Meir  Kluwgant,  head  of  the  Rabbinical  Council  of  Victoria  and  also  the  spiritual  head  of  Jewish  Care,   said  he  was  aware  of  at  least  one  mes   sianic  Jew  working  as  a  volunteer  with  the  organisation  and  said  the  matter  would  shortly  come  to  a  “satisfactory   outcome”.   However,  he  said,  “I  am  not  aware   of  even  a  shred  of  evidence  to  suggest  there  was  any  proselytising  taking  place  at  Jewish  Care.  If  there  was,  I  would  deal  with  it  immediately”   Jewish  Care  faces  a  dilemma  in  resolving  the  issue  because  it  is  an  equal-opportunity  employer.  And  while  volunteers  are  not  strictly  classi  fied  as  “workers”  they  can  claim  to  be  discriminated  against,  depending  on  the  circumstances  of  their  termination.   I  “It  would  be  naive  and   dangerous  to  assume  that  the  fact  they  have  chosen  to  volunteer   their  time  to  a  Jewish   organisation  is  merely  a   I  coincidence.”   RAPHAEL  ARON  Director,  Cult  Consulting   The  director  of  Cult  Counselling  Australia,  Raphael  Aron,  said  Cele  brate  Messiah  used  a  variety  of   sophisticated  techniques  to  spread  its  message,  which  he  described  as  “false  and  misleading”.  He  urged  Jewish  Care  to  deal  urgently  with  the  matter.   “The  fact  that  two  people  who  are  associated  with  this  organisation  are  working  at  Jewish  Care  is  certainly  a   reason  for  serious  concern.  It  would  be  naive  and  dangerous  to  assume  that  the  fact  they  have  chosen  to  vol  unteer  their  time  to  a  Jewish  organi  sation  is  merely  a  coincidence.  I  believe  there  is  a  clear  agenda.”   Aron  said  Celebrate  Messiah  had   recently  attempted  to  infiltrate  another  community  organisation.  “In  relation  to  Jewish  Care,  the  fact  that  the  clientele  are  elderly,  and  possibly  vulnerable  people,  highlights  the  seri  ousness  of  this  issue.  Many  of  the  patients  in  the  aged-care  facility  are  lonely  and  some  may  not  be  able  to  fully  comprehend  the  message  this  group  promotes.   “The  problem  also  highlights  the  need  for  greater  scrutiny  by  all  Jewish  organisations  in  their  recruitment  of  staff,”  he  said.

"  JEWISH  GROUPS  DECRY  CATHOLIC  TEXT   NEW  YORK  -  A  coalition  of  Jewish  groups  expressed  disap  pointment  at  the  new  text  of  the  Catholic  Church’s  Prayer  for  the  Jews.  The  prayer   removes  Ian   guage  considered  offensive  to  Jews,  including  a  reference  to  Jews’  “blind  ness""  and  a  call  that  God  “may  lift  the  veil  from  their  hearts”,  but  still  prays  for  the  salvation  of  the  Jews  exclusively  through  conversion  to  Christianity.  Pope  Benedict  XVI  (pictured)  last  week  unveiled  the  replacement  for  the  Good  Friday  prayer  in  Latin.   “We  had  hoped  that  the  prayer  in  the  Latin  rite  would  be  the  same  as  that  of  the  universal  Catholic  liturgy  in  use  since  1970,”  said  International  Jewish  Committee  on  Interreligious  Consulta  tions  chairman  Rabbi  David  Rosen.

At  the  launch  of  AusIMed  Research  Fund  on  Tuesday  night,  Roxon  addressed  the  hundreds  of  doctors  and  health  professionals  in  the  room.   ""We  have  an  opportunity  now  to  change,  but  we  need  that  input  and  those  ideas,”  Roxon  said.  ”1  would  like  to  encourage  all  of  you  to  consider  being  part  of  the  reform  process  ...  we  really  need  to  tap  the  talent  that  you  bring  to  this  sort  of  debate.”   After  listening  to  presentations  from  neurologist  Professor  Stephen  Davis,  children’s  health  specialist  Professor  Frank  Oberidaid,  adolescent  expert  Pro  fessor  Susan  Sawyer  and  Dr  Yair  Bim  baum  from  Jerusalem's  Hadassah  Medical  Organisation,  Roxon  said  she  was  optimistic  about  AusIMed's  potential:   ‘I  hope  that  AusIMed,  fn  the  years  to  come,  sparks  brilliant  new  ideas,  excit  ing  new  approaches  and  gives  us  advances  in  medicine  that  are  as  impor  tant  as  penicillin,  Gardasil  or  the  X-rayT  Roxonsaid.   The  health  minister  also  quipped  that  she  hoped  AusIMed  would  be  a  successful  cross-cultural  collaboration,  just  like  herself.   “I  do  have  to  have  to  confess  to  being  a  cross-cultural  collaboration  myself,  between  a  family  of  socialist,  Polish  Jews  and  a  family  of  Anglican  saw-millers  living  in  northern  New  South  Wales.""

In  the  flap  being  played  out  over  the  internet,  Jackie  Mason  called  Sarah  Sil  verman  a  “sick  yenta”  for  suggesting  the  bigotry  of  older  Jews  could  cost  Obama   the  election.   “If  Barack  Obama  doesn’t  become  the  next  president  of  the  United  States,  I’m  going  to  blame  the  Jews,”  Silverman  said  in  a  web  video,  noting  that  older  Jewish  grandparents  in  Florida  may  be  reluctant  to  vote  for  a  candidate  with  a  “scary”-sounding  Muslim  name.   In  the  humorous,  expletive-laden  video,  which  was  viewed  about  a  million  times  on  its  first  day  of  release  last  week,  Silverman  urged  younger  Jews  to   visit  their  grandparents  in  retirement  vil  lages  throughout  Florida  and  encourage  them  to  vote  for  Obama.

"  SYDNEY  JEWISH  SCHOOL  FEES  ON  THE  RISE     BENJAMIN  LEVY     JEWISH  school  fees  across  Sydney   have  increased  for  2008.   In  some  cases,  fees  have  risen  by  almost  eight  per  cent.  Parents  of  stu-  dents  in  Year  12  at  Sydney’s  biggest  Jewish  school,  Moriah  College,  will  pay  $19,192,  an  increase  of  4.87  per  cent.  Year  12  at  Masada  College  and  Kesser  Torah  College  has  increased  by  six  per  cent  to  $17,745  and  $16,749  respectively.  And  the  final  year’s   tuition  at  Emanuel  School  will  set  fee  payers  back  $17,100,  an  increase  of  5.23  per  cent.   Mount  Sinai  College  has  posted  the  largest  percentage  increase  in  fees  (an  increase  of  eight  per  cent)  but  still  remains  the  cheapest  of  Sydney’s  Jew-  ish  schools,  with  its  Grade  6  fees  set  at  $9840  for  2008.   Over  the  past  five  years,  private   schools  have  increased  their  fees  at   the  same  time  as  government  funding  has  also  gone  up.  A  study  carried  out  by  The  Sydney  Morning  Herald  found  that  Federal  Government  funding  for  private  schools  had  increased  on  aver-  age  by  22  per  cent  from  2003  to  2007,  with  several  Jewish  schools  included  in  the  study.   Each  of  the  Jewish  schools  con-  tacted  by  The  AJN  defended  the  increased  fees,  saying  that  the  only  aim  was  to  help  the  schools  break  even.  They  indicated  that  most  of  the  extra  revenue  will  be  spent  on  increas-  ing  staff  salaries  to  combat  rising   inflation  and  aid  teacher  retention.   Mount  Sinai  College  made  an  evaluation  of  the  overall  situation  of  the  school  before  they  increased  fees.   “We  constantly  focus  on  delivering  education  at  the  cheapest  level  and   we’ve  been  very  successful  in  that,”  said  school  president  Stephen  Seidman.   Of  the  government  funding  cur-  rently  received  by  Mount  Sinai,  most  goes  towards  meeting  the  costs  of   teachers’  salaries.   Emanuel  School  president  Jonathan  Sesel  said  that  in  addition  to  covering  inflation,  Emanuel  also  had  to  increase  salaries  as  teachers  became  more  experienced.   “We  retain  most  of  our  teachers,  with  the  result  that  with  the  increases,  plus  the  four-and-half  per  cent  [infla-  tion],  we  need  a  five  per  cent  increase  to  balance  [costs],”  Sesel  said.

"  CHANTAL  ABfTBOL   AUSTRALIA’S   Jewish  day  schools  earn  top  marks  for   their  secular  studies,  but  when  it  comes  to  Jewish  studies,  “there  is  a  lot  to  be  desired”,   said  Sima  Guttman  (pictured),  semor  educational  consultant  for  the  Zionist  Federation  of  Australia  (ZFA)  and  representative  of  the  Jewish  Agency's  education  department   For  the  past  three  years,  Guttman  has  worked  to  develop  Jewish  cur  riculum  in  day  schools  throughout   i  Australia.  But  while  her  tenure  comes   |  to  an  end  this  August,  much  work  i  remains  to  secure  “quality”  Jewish   education  for  students  today,  she  said.   One  of  the  main  problems  is  the  shortage  of  future  local  Jewish  educa  tors,  she  said.  “The  community  is  not  investing  enough  in  recruiting  young  '  people  into  the  profession  and  encour   aging  them  to  make  Jewish  education  their  career,”  she  told  The  AJN.  “There  also  isn’t  enough  of  an  incentive  for  current  teachers  to  move  further  pro  fessionally  within  their  field.”   Her  other  concern  is  the  negative  •  sentiment  among  some  Jewish  stu   dents  that  they  are  “Jewed-out”  with  their  studies.  “There  are  some  Jewish  '*  students  who  come  out  of  Jewish  day   schools,  and  they  have  a  sense  of‘been  there,  done  thaf.  They  feel  they  don’t  need  to  be  involved  anymore  with  the  Jewish  community,  which  is  the  exact  opposite  of  what  Jewish  education  aims  to  achieve,”  Guttman  said.   Still,  she  admitted,  some  strides  to  improve  the  curriculum  have  been   made  by  ZFA  in  the  last  few  years.   Among  them  is  introducing  Israel   studies  to  the  curriculum  of  most   Jewish  high  schools  around  Australia,  as  well  as  Hebrew  classes  to  preschools.   ZFA  also  initiated  the  My  Israel  Quiz  competition,  inviting  2000  pri  mary  school  students  from  12  schools   across  Australia  and  New  Zealand  to   test  their  knowledge  on  Israel,  its  his  tory  and  main  players.   This  year,  Leibler  Yavneh  College  year  6  student  Joel  Chester,  from  Mel  bourne,  who  placed  second  in  the  state  finals,  went  on  to  claim  first  prize  in  the  international  competition.   These  triumphs  are  significant,  Guttman  said,  but  the  work  must  continue  with  her  successor,  who  has  yet  to  be  confirmed.   “The  community  is  not   investing  enough  in   recruiting  young  people  into  the  profession.”   SIMA  GUTTMAN  Educational  consultant,  ZFA   On  top  of  her  to-do  list  would  be  the  development  of  a  system  to  train  teachers,  and  she  would  like  to  see  more  direct  links  forged  between  day  schools  in  Australia  and  Israel,  including  brother-sister  projects.  “Even  though  Israel  is  a  presence  in  Australia’s  day  schools,  it’s  not  per  sonalised  enough,”  Guttman  said.   On  the  eve  of  her  departure,  Guttman  was  excited  to  return  home  to  Jerusalem,  but  said  she  leaves  Aus  tralia  with  “mixed  feelings”.   “There’s  still  work  unfinished,”  she  added.

"  What  if  a  messianic  Jew  wins  Israel’s  Bible  quiz?   JERUSALEM  -  Should  Bat  El  Levy  be  asked  at  Israel’s  international  youth  Bible  Quiz  about  the  messiah’s  com  ing,  she  may  find  herself  in  a  bind.  The  17-year-old  Jerusalem  girl  is  a  world-class  scriptural  scholar  who,  as  it  happens,  believes  in  Jesus.   It  might  never  have  been  an  issue  were  it  not  for  the  sleuthing  of  an  Israeli  anti-missionary  group,  Yad  LeAhim,  which  sees  Levy’s  participa  tion  in  the  annual  Jewish  Bible  con  test  as  a  threat  to  Judaism.   Yad  LeAhim  director  Shlomo  Dov  Lipschitz  called  for  the  Education  Ministry  to  disqualify  Levy  from  the   quiz,  which  takes  place  annually  on  Yom  Ha’atzmaut.  Lipschitz  argued  that  Levy,  who  comes  from  a  family  of  messianic  Jews  -  who  believe  Jesus  is  the  messiah  -  should  not  be  consid  ered  Jewish.  He  also  included  an  apparent  appeal  to  prestige:  the  fear  of  traditional  Jews  being  shown  up  in  Bible  knowledge  by  someone  who  has  mastered  the  New  Testament  as  well.   Several  leading  sages  signed  on,  threatening  a  boycott  of  the  quiz.  Levy  is  slated  to  face  off  against  15  young  biblical  scholars  from  Israel  and  the  Diaspora.

A  ministry  spokesman  said  that  issues  of  per  sonal  belief  were  not  the  organisers’  concern  and  that  because  Levy  “is  Jewish  according  to  her  Israeli  iden  tity  cards  and  school  registration”  she  can  take  part  in  the  contest.   Levy,  the  Bible  Quiz  champion  for  the  Jerusalem  District,  was  unavail  able  for  comment.  Relatives  said  she   was  too  busy  studying  for  the  compe  tition  to  deal  with  the  media  uproar.   A  family  confidant,  who  declined  to  be  identified,  confirmed  that  the  Levys  are  followers  of  Jesus  -  or,  as  they  would  put  it,  “Yeshua  Ben-David  of  Nazareth”.  But  the  confidant   denied  that  Levy  or  her  kin  were  involved  in  proselytising  other  Jews  -  a  crime  in  Israel,  where  many  blame  church  dogma  for  centuries  of  Euro  pean  anti-Semitism  and  persecution.   Israel  has  an  estimated  8000  so   called  messianic  Jews.  In  effect  they  are  crypto-Christians,  practicing  their  faith  discreetly  for  fear  of  stoking  hostility   among  mainstream  Jews.   JTA ",2008-05-09
"  How  many  parents  does  it  take  to  make  a  Jew?   What  is  your  response  to  the   Reform  movement  in  Australia   having  recently  standardised  its  recognition  of  people  as  Jewish  who  have  a  Jewish  father,  but  not  a  Jewish  mother?   SOMEONE  said  that  the  poor   will  always  be  with  us.  That  may  or  may  not  be  true,  but  as  far  as  Jews  are  concerned  there  are  certain  questions  that  are  always  with  us:  God  and  man,  life  and  death  ...  above  all,  the  question  of  Jewish  identity.  In  other  words,  who  is  a  Jew?   Yitzhak  Rabin  asked,  “How  many  feces  has  Judaism  got?”  Fair  enough,  but  if  we  are  going  to  ask  questions,  why  not  ask,  “How  many  parents   does  it  take  to  make  a  Jew?”  One  is  reminded  of  the  Succot  question:  how  many  walls  does  it  take  to  make  a  succah?  The  answer?  Ideally,  four  -  but  three  will  also  do,  and  in  certain  circumstances  two-and-a-half.  So,  how  many  parents  does  it  take  to  make  a  Jew?   It  depends  on  whether  either  or  both  parents  are  Jewish  themselves.  Ideally,  two  Jewish  parents  make  a  child  Jewish.  Traditionally,  one  is  also  acceptable,  provided  it  is  the  mother.  And  thereby  hangs  the  tale.  What  if  the  one  parent  who  is  Jewish  is  the  father?  (One  could,  of  course,  also  ask  what  happens  if  neither  parent  is  Jewish  and  the  child  wants  to  enter  Judaism  by  conversion.  But  that’s  another  story.)   The  matrilineal  principle  -  Jew   Michelle  (left)  and  Leetai  Anldam  on  Mothers  Day  last  year.  Photo:  AJN  file   ishness  by  maternal  descent  -  has  been  the  rule  throughout  history.  When  in  1958,  David  Ben  Gurion  wrote  to  scholars  in  many  countries  asking  for  their  definition  of  a  Jew,  most  respondents,  whatever  their  personal  affiliation,  endorsed  the  tra  ditional  definition  and  said  that  “only  one  who  is  bom  to  a  Jewish   mother  or  who  is  converted  to   Judaism  according  to  halachah”  could  be  regarded  as  Jewish  (B  Litvin,  Jewish  Identity,  edited  by  SB  Hoenig,  1965).   The  biblical  source  of  the  princi  ple  is  Devarim  7:3-4,  which  refers  to  “your  son”  as  the  child  of  an  Israelite  mother,  implying,  according  to  rab  binic  exegesis,  that  a  child  is  not  “your  son”  in  a  religious  sense  if  the  mother  is  non-Jewish.  This  conclu  sion  found  in  the  Talmud  (Kid  dushin  65b,  68b)  is  cited  and  accepted  by  all  halachic  authorities,  including  Maimonides  and  the   Shulchan  Aruch.  There  are  no  dis   senting  opinions,  either  in  the  Tal   mud  or  from  later  rabbis.  This  has  been  the  unbroken  rule  throughout  history.  Lord  Jakobovits  offers  the  following  rationale  (The  Timely  and  the  Timeless,  1977,  pages  198-217):   1.  The  certainty  of  maternity  must  be  set  against  the  possible  doubt  of  paternity.   2.  Even  in  nature,  the  mother’s  bond  with  her  child  is  firmer  than   the  father’s.   3.  The  mother  has  the  superior  influence  on  the  child’s  religious  development.   4.  In  a  mixed  marriage,  Jewish  law  technically  regards  the  child  as  hav  ing  only  one  parent,  the  mother.   The  matrilineal  principle  -Jewishness  by   maternal  descent  -  has   I  been  the  rule   throughout  history.   Outside  Orthodoxy,  in  an  age  in   which  our  numbers  are  not  increas   ing  while  mixed  marriage  is,  both  the  rule  and  the  rationale  are  questioned.  David  Goldberg,  a  British  Liberal  rabbi,  argues  that  the  halachic  defini  tion  “cannot  be  Justified  biologically,  eugenically,  genetically  or  education  aUy”  and  that  “it  can  only  be  defended  on  the  basis  of  tradition”.  (Jewish  Chronicle,  August  27,1982).  It  is  also  argued  that  commitment  to  Judaism  is  a  more  important  pointer  than  whether  or  not  the  mother  happens  to  be  Jewish.   The  outcome  is  that  the  Reform   movement  is  prepared  to  accept  as  Jewish  the  child  of  a  couple  of  whom  either  parent  is  a  Jew,  on  the  basis  that  this  will  make  Judaism  more  inclusive.  There  are  many  good  rea   sons  to  oppose  this  policy:   1.  A  person  seeking  acceptance  as  Jewish  has  the  option  of  conversion.   2.  It  is  a  counsel  of  defeat  to  confer   Jewish  status  upon  people  for  the  sake  of  increasing  our  numbers;  the  constructive  option  is  to  make  better  Jews  of  the  Jews  we  have,  and  to  encourage  them  to  have  larger  fami  lies  of  Jewish  children.   3.  The  policy  would  encourage  mixed  marriage  and  threaten  our  survival,  especially  since  twice  as  many  Jewish  men  marry  out  com  pared  to  women.   4.  Since  the  Jewish  character  of  the  home  is  still  largely  in  the  hands  of  the  woman,  a  non-Jewish  mother  is  unlikely  to  create  a  Jewish  atmos  phere  for  her  children   5.  If  Jewish  law  can  be  unilaterally  turned  on  its  head,  why  maintain  other  possibly  inconvenient  princi  ples  or  practices  of  Judaism?   6.  Since  Orthodoxy  will  not  join  in  the  Reform  policy,  but  remain  pledged  to  the  halachah,  Reform  will  have  irrevocably  split  the  entire  Jew  ish  people  asunder.   7.  The  policy  is  not  fair  to  the  next  generation,  who  will  find  that  their  parents  have  saddled  them  with  an  unnecessary  identity  crisis.   No-one  denies  we  have  problems,  but  patrilinealism  solves  none  of  them.   www.oztorah.com ",2008-12-19
"  The  most  Jewish  day  of  all   THE  Jewish  calendar  is  dotted  with  festivals  that  we  do  together.   Before  Pesach,  the  common  question  is:  “What  are  you  doing  for  seder?”  because  in  the  introduction  to  the  haggadah,  it  is  written  “all  who  are  hungry  come  and  eat”   Then  there  is  Rosh  Hashanah.  “What  are  you  doing  for  yom  tov?”  is  the  age-old  question  ahead  of  the  Jewish  new  year,  as  family,  friends  and  col  leagues  inquire  of  your  whereabouts  for  shul  and  the  various  meals  that  are  so  intrinsic  to  the  chag.  Similar  questions  abound  for  Shavuot,  Succot  and  Chanukah  -  festivals  that  command  us  to  observe  and  celebrate  en  masse.   But  Yom  Kippur  is  fundamentally  different  As  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  and  Sam  Lipski  note  in  their  columns  in  this  week’s  AJN,  it  is  a  day  of  soli  tude  and  silence;  one  where  in  practice,  there  is  an  absence  of  any  real  group  dynamic,  except  in  the  synagogue.  Nobody  really  cares  where  you  dawen,  or  where  you  ate  before  or  after  the  fast  All  that  really  matters  is  how  you  fasted.  If  you’re  asked  it  once,  you’re  probably  asked  it  a  dozen  times.   Yom  Kippur  tells  so  much  about  die  Jewish  life  we  choose  to  lead.  Yes,  it  is  a  solemn  day  in  which  we  fast  and  ask  God  for  forgiveness,  of  course,  but  there  are  a  bunch  of  fast  days  on  the  calendar  each  year.  So  why  is  it  that  Yom  Kippur  is  the  only  day  that  so  many  non-religious  Jews  choose  to  observe?  Perhaps  it  is  because  it  is  commanded  by  the  Torah,  but  there  are  so  many  other  Torah  commandments  that  so  many  of  us  willingly  and  in  some  cases,  gleefully,  choose  not  to  observe.   There  are  Jews,  who  -  simchas  aside  -  don’t  set  foot  inside  a  synagogue  any  other  time  of  the  year  except  for  the  Yizkor  service  on  the  morning  of  Yom  Kippur,  in  honour  of  dear  departed  loved  ones.  Why  this  day?   For  those  who  choose  not  to  observe  any  Jewish  festivals,  Yom  Kippur  is  often  marked  by  the  lengths  they  go  to,  to  make  sine  they  have  something  to  eat  -  usually  something  hearty  and  substantial  -  just  to  make  their  point   That’s  what  makes  Yom  Kippur  so  important  and  so  fundamental  to  the  Jewish  soul.  There  is  no  other  day  that  so  defines  the  sort  of  Jew  you  are. ",2008-10-03

"  Violent  attack  on  Jewish  teenagers  in  Perth   CHANTALABiTEOL   A  VIOLENT  attack  on  four  Jewish  teenagers  last  Friday  night  in  Perth  -  which  ended  with  a  group  of  youths  defacing  the  car  of  a  good  Samaritan  who  had  offered  assistance  -  has  left   the  Jewish  community  in  shock.   Rabbi  Marcus  Solomon,  father  of  one  of  the  victims  and  rabbi  at  Dianella  Shule  in  Yokine,  told  The  AJN  the  teenagers  had  been  walking  home  at  about  11pm  after  a  Shabbat  dinner  at  the  synagogue  when  they  were  accosted  by  a  group  of  young  men  outside  a  house  party.   He  said  the  group  obviously  recognised  the  Jewish  identity  of  the  victims  -  three  15-year-old  boys  and  a  16-year-old  girl  -  and  began  taunting  them  with  racial  slurs,  yelling  “f...king  Jew  c...ts”  and  “You  hate  Arabs”.   The  group  then  kicked  and  bashed  the  boys’  faces,  Rabbi  Solomon  said,  while  the  girl  remained  “frozen  in   Teenagers  who  attended  DIanella  Shule  (pictured)  on  Friday  night  were  attacked  while  walking  home.   fear”  before  fleeing  to  safety  with  one  of  the  boys.   The  attackers  chased  the  two  remaining  boys  to  a  nearby  home  where  the  resident  offered  refuge  after  seeing  the  boys’  facial  injuries.   .  Then,  a  few  minutes  later,  the  attackers  pulled  up  in  a  vehicle  outside  the  Samaritan’s  home,  took  a  letterbox  from  a  nearby  property  and  van  dalised  the  car  parked  in  the  driveway.   I‘The  community  is  in   j  shock  and  outrage,..  I've   j  never  heard  of  such  an   event  in  Western  Australia’’   RABBI  MARCUS  SOLOMON   Father  of  the  victim   “The  community  is  in  shock  and  outrage,”  Rabbi  Solomon  said.  “To  think  that  this  was  a  racially  motivated  and  entirely  unprovoked  attack  is  deeply  disturbing.  I’ve  never  heard  of  such  an  event  in  Western  Australia.”   Rabbi  Solomon,  who  also  serves  as  vice-president  of  the  Carmel  School,  expressed  “serious  concern”  that  the  violent  crime  was  carried  out  on   Woodrow  Avenue  -  the  home  of  numerous  other  Jewish  institutions,  including  the  Carmel  School,  the  Maccabi  sports  grounds  and  the  WA  Jewish  Centre.   Morley  detective  senior-sergeant  Nick  Fucile,  who  is   Rabbi  Marcus  Solomon,   father  of  one  of  the  bashed  teenagers.   heading  the  investi   gation,  has  downplayed  suggestions  that  the  attack  was  racially  driven.   The  attackers  have  not  yet  been  identified,  but  the  police  officer  said  early  indications  suggested  the  vic  tims  had  not  been  targeted  because  of  their  Jewish  identity.   “We’re  treating  it  as  an  assault,”  he  told  The  AJN.  “I  don’t  want  to  single  out  any  group  at  this  time.  We’re  still  conducting  inquiries.”   Keith  Shilkin,  president  of  the  Jewish  Community  Council  of  WA,  said  until  the  perpetrators  were  caught,  the  attack’s  nature  was  “not  crystal  clear”.   “Assertions  can  be  made,  but  until  we  get  the  facts,  that’s  all  they  are,”  he  said.  “We’re  letting  the  police  investi  gation  take  its  natural  course.” ",2008-06-06
"  Proud  Jew,  family  man   SEND  OBITUARIES  TO  jrobuck@jewishnews.net.au   CAROLYN  ZIEGLER   HARRY  Gayst  was  a  man  who  lived  life  to  the  fullest  and  cherished  every  day  with  his  family   and  friends.  He  was  a  devoted  father  to  Stephen  and  Carolyn  and  a  loving  husband  to  Doris  -  a  true  family  man.  He  understood  the  value  of  what  a  family  meant.  He  extended  this  attitude  not  only  to  his  very  few  blood  rel  atives  but  also  to  people  that  were  so  close  to  him,  considering  them  to  family  as  well.   Harry  was  bom  Herman  Geist  on  Septem  ber  17,  1918,  in  Kutno,  Poland.  He  was  brought  up  in  a  loving,  caring  Jewish  family,  consisting  of  his  father  Szymon,  mother  Fra  nk,  older  sister  Hela  (Chaja)  and  himself.   They  lived  in  an  apartment  above  his  fam  ily’s  printing  press  that  had  been  founded  by  his  great-grandfather.   Harry  always  had  much  pride  in  being  Jewish  and  the  fact  that  his  father  and  uncle  were  both  founding  members  of  the  first  Zionist  organisation  in  Kutno.  As  Harry  grew  up,  he  could  feel  the  anti-Semitic  behaviour  growing  around  them  as  a  result  of  the  prop  aganda  that  was  coming  out  of  Germany.  Believing  there  was  no  future  for  the  Jewish  youth  in  Kutno,  Harry’s  father  wanted  Harry   to  leave  Poland.   Harry’s  uncle,  who  lived  in  Australia,  sent  him  a  permit.  Just  before  he  left,  his  father  said  something  to  him  that  he  would  never  forget:  “Remember  Herman,  be  a  Jew.”   Just  before  he  left,  his  father   said  something  to  him  that  he  would  never  forget:  “Remember  Herman,  be  a  Jew”   At  the  age  of  19,  after  travelling  for  seven  weeks  on  the  Orana  Orient  Line  to  Sydney,  with  only  his  clothing  and  printing  equip  ment  for  making  rubber  stamps  in  his  suit  case,  Harry  arrived  in  Sydney.   Harry  did  not  speak  or  understand  English  and  this  made  it  nearly  impossible  for  him  to  find  work,  even  at  a  printing  company.  How  ever,  he  paid  the  Shepson  Printing  Company  to  use  their  facilities  to  print  a  Yiddish  and  Hebrew  pamphlet  about  die  election  of  mem  bers  for  the  Board  of  Jewish  Deputies  in  1942.  Harry  worked  hard  to  learn  the  language,  knowing  the  importance  of  communication   in  his  new  home.   He  was  very  interested  in  learning  a  trade,  as  he  believed  it  could  lead  him  into  a  future  where  he  could  work  for  himself  one  day.  His  uncle  Wolf  hired  him  to  work  at  his  jewellery  com  pany.  It  was  at  this  time  he  changed  his  name  to  Harry  Gayst.  Wolf  had  anglicised  his  own  name  to  Gayst  from  Geist  many  years  before.   One  day  while  playing  football  with  some  friends  on  the  beach,  one  of  them  told  Harry  about  a  munitions  factory  where  he  might  be  able  to  get  a  job.  He  went  for  the  job  and  was  interviewed  by  an  Englishman  who,  while  not  a  Jew  himself,  was  very  fond  of  Jews.  He  gave  Harry  the  job  and  treated  him  well.   Harry  enjoyed  working  at  this  factory.  Many  of  the  workers  had  been  jewellers  and  watchmakers,  doing  fine,  highly  skilled  and  technical  work,  and  would  make  very  intricate  or  delicate  things  that  needed  a  careful  eye.  Often  girls  working  at  the  factory  would  bring  Harry  jewellery  to  fix  because  he  was  so  good  at  working  with  metal.  It  was  here  that  he  dis  covered  his  passion  and  talent  for  being  a  jew  eller,  which  led  him  to  attend  technical  college  to  study  jewellery  manufacturing.  He  worked  during  the  day  and  would  study  at  night.   Tragically,  Harry  lost  his  family  in  the  Holocaust,  at  the  Chelmno  concentration  camp.  In  contrast  to  the  aggression  and  hatred  he  would  have  felt  in  Poland,  Harry  was  wel   HARRY  GAYST   1918-2008   corned  in  Sydney  and  had  many  friends.  He  belonged  to  Hakoah  swimming  and  tennis  clubs  and  would  regularly  attend  Maccabi  dances,  where  he  met  his  wife,  Doris.   In  1945,  Harry  started  his  own  business  as  a  jeweller.  He  had  a  difficult  time  at  first  because  he  was  not  well  known  but  the  few  customers  kept  coming  back  and  word  spread  quickly  of  his  quality  workmanship,  so  he  became  quite  successful.  He  was  passionate  about  his  work,  and  only  retired  at  the  age  of  72.   On  January  2,1951,  Harry  married  Doris.  They  had  two  children,  Stephen  and  Carolyn.  Harry  was  a  wonderful  father  and  loving  hus  band,  deeply  devoted  to  and  proud  of  his  fam  ily.  His  whole  life  revolved  around  his  family.   Working  hard  as  a  jeweller,  he  gave  his  family  the  best  life  he  could.  He  loved  file  fam  ily  holidays  every  summer.  Having  lost  his  parents  and  sister,  and  his  extended  family  back  in  Poland,  he  loved  his  wife  Doris  and  children  very  much  and  understood  the  importance  of  the  family  unit.  As  his  children  grew  up,  he  was  very  proud  of  Stephen,  an  industrial  pharmacist,  and  Carolyn,  a  teacher.   When  Carolyn  married  Tony,  he  beamed  with  pride,  but  nothing  compared  to  Harry  and  Doris’  pride  when  they  became  grandpar  ents  to  Lauren  and  Bindy.  Nothing  could  keep  him  from  seeing  them  growing  up  and  shar  ing  in  their  lives.  With  the  travel  that  Carolyn  and  Tony  did  for  business,  he  loved  that  he  and  Doris  could  help  take  care  of  the  children.   Later,  struck  by  tragedy,  Stephen  died  almost  10  years  ago.  Harry  missed  his  son  terribly,  but  knew  he  had  to  be  strong  for  Doris,  Carolyn,  Tony  and  his  two  lovely  granddaughters.   Nothing  gave  Harry  more  pleasure  than  doing  things  with  his  family,  such  as  hearing  Lauren  play  her  flute,  or  having  in-depth  con  versations  with  Bindy  and  sharing  Friday  night  Shabbat  dinners.   Only  recently,  during  his  time  in  hospital,  he  was  thrilled  to  hear  that  Lauren  was  getting  credits  in  her  uni  essays  and  that,  while  he  was  in  hospital,  Bindy  would  drive  Doris  to  doc  tor’s  appointments  or  to  see  him.   Harry  had  experienced  some  illness  through  his  life  but  he  was  always  more  con   cerned  about  Doris.  She  had  been  so  ill  and  this  was  his  primary  concern.  For  almost  three  weeks,  Doris  was  in  hospital,  coming  out  only  one  week  before  Harry  was  rushed  to  hospital  himself.  While  she  was  in  hospital,  Harry  would  go  to  visit  Doris  everyday.  Carolyn  would  take  him  most  days,  but  on  one  or  two  occasions  he  drove  himself  because  he  wanted  to  spend  an  even  longer  time  with  her.   Harry’s  family  has  great  memories  of  a  lov  ing  husband,  father,  father-in-law  and  grand  father;  he  will  be  missed  by  everyone  who  knew  him.  Even  the  carers  during  his  short  stay  in  hospital  called  him  a  true  gentleman.  He  was  proud  of  his  heritage,  his  achieve  ments,  his  family  history  and,  most  of  all,  of  being  a  “Jew”.   Carolyn  Ziegler  is  Harry  Gayst’s  daughter. ",2008-05-09
"  Jewish  Care  volunteer  ‘did  not  discuss  Jesus’   peter  mm   A  VOLUNTEER  at  Jewish  Care  Victoria  who  belongs  to  Celebrate  Messiah,  an  organi  sation  for  Jews  who  believe  in  Jesus,  said  this  week  she  has  never  discussed  reli  gion  with  patients.   Louise  Hirsch  told  The  AJN  that  she  and  two  other  members  of  Celebrate  Messiah  had  been  working  as  volunteers  at  Jewish  Care  for  several  months  before  she  was  confronted  by  Suzanne  Terkel,  whose  mother  is  a  patient  at  Jewish  Care’s  Smorgon  Family  Nursing  Home.   During  a  conversation  between  the  two  that  developed  into  a  verbal  clash,  it  emerged  that  Hirsch  belonged  to  Celebrate  Messiah  Australia  and  that  her  husband  Lawrence  was  its  executive  director.   On  July  15,  while  Hirsch  was  at  the  Smorgon  unit,  she  claimed  another  tense  encounter  with  Terkel  had  occurred.  ""She  screamed  at  me  in  such  a  disgusting  way  ,in  front  of  so  many  people,”  Hirsch  said.   Terkel  contacted  The  AJN  after  this  incident  and  said  she  was  ""appalled”  that  messianic  Jews  were  permitted  to  volun  teer  at  the  facility,  working  with  patients  ""near  the  end  of  their  life”.   But  Hirsch  said  Terkel’s  attitude  was  discriminatory  and  that  she  had  “a  per  sonal  agenda”  in  opposing  the  presence  of  messianic  Jews  at  Jewish  Care.   Hirsch  said  the  three  members  of  the  messianic  movement  had  identified  their  beliefs  to  Jewish  Care  when  they  applied  to  work  as  volunteers,  and  had  told  man  agement  that  they  had  no  intention  of   proselytising.  ButTerkel  told  The  AJN  this  week  that  it  was  “naive""  to  assume  that  members  of  Celebrate  Messiah  were  there  for  any  other  reason.   Jewish  Care  said  this  week  that  patients  had  not  been  placed  at  risk.  It  said  it  “unambiguously  embraces""  the  diversity  of  its  personnel.   Jewish  Care  president  Robyne  Schwarz  said  the  organisation  did  not  discriminate  against  its  workforce  and  that  it  embraced  the  “richness""  that  was  produced  as  a  result  of  its  stance.   “Without  apology  or  equivocation,  we  currently,  and  will  continue,  to  recruit  and  retain  the  very  best  people  we  can,  to  ensure  we  can  offer  the  very  best  of  care  to  our  clients  and  residents,  who  are  our  highest  priority,""  Schwarz  said.

"  Rich  and  poor   THE  release  of  the  annual  JSRWRich  List  is  a  cause  of  fascination  for   most  Australian  Jews.  Many  of  us  will  sneak  a  peek  at  the  list  at  some  stage  and  make  a  mental  note  of  the  number  of  Jews  who  make  an   appearance.   That’s  okay.  It  should  be  a  source  of  pride  that  a  bunch  of  immigrants,  some  first  generation,  others  whose  lives  have  been  shaped  by  the  immi  grant  experience,  and  in  many  cases,  the  hell  their  families  went  through  before  they  moved  to  Australia,  should  have  made  such  a  success  out  of  this  wonderful  country.   But  the  converse  Rich  List  is  the  poor  list.  There  are  significant  numbers  of  Jewish  poor  in  Australia,  among  them  ultra-Orthodox  families  in  Melbourne  and  Sydney,  as  well  as  immigrant  families  from  countries,  such  as  Russia.   A  recent  survey  commissioned  by  Sydney’s  Jewish  Communal  Appeal  demonstrated  that  migrants  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  comprise  the  largest  Jewish  population  in  South  Sydney  and  that  17  per  cent  of  families  from  that  demographic  take  home  less  than  $500  a  week  before  tax.  Try  feed  ing,  clothing  and  educating  a  family  of  four  or  more,  on  that  weekly  income.   Of  course,  the  contrast  between  rich  and  poor  is  not  unique  to  our  com  munity,  but  we  can  be  proud  of  the  commitment  to  tzedakah  shown  by  Australian  Jews  on  the  Rich  List,  as  well  as  thousands  of  other  Australian  Jewish  families,  who  give  to  the  best  of  their  abilities.   Be  it  bricks  and  mortar,  donations,  or  simply  rolling  up  their  sleeves  and  helping  in  the  kitchen,  Jewish  Australians  understand  that  they  need  to  do  their  bit  to  help  those  less  fortunate  than  themselves.   Which  is  why  there’s  no  shame  in  taking  an  interest  in  the  list  and  for  The  AJN  to  report  on  it.

It  was  no  different  this  year.  Scores  of  runners,  joggers,   walkers  and  strollers  dusted  off  their  sneakers  for  the  annual  14-kilometre  trek   Jonathan  Clennar,  a  veteran  of  ten  City2Surf  races,  was  the  first  Jew  to  finish  when  he  completed  the  course  in  52  minutes  and  43  seconds,  crossing  the  line  in  266th  place.   Clennar,  42,  motors  through  70  kilometres  a  week  in  his  six  running   and  two  swimming  sessions.  He  sees  the  City2Surf  and  Sydney  Half  Marathon  as  the  highlights  of  his  sporting  calendar.   “It’s  a  very  special  day,”  the  Wol  longong  resident  said.

"  CHANTALABfTBGL   SIX  Jewish  leaders  will  meet  Pope  Benedict  XVI  at  an  interfaith  event  this  Friday  -  the  same  day  the  Catholic  Church  plans  to  take  the  controversial  Stations  of  the  Cross  procession  to  Sydney's  streets  as  part  of  World  Youth  Day  (WYD)  celebrations.   The  meeting  will  be  attended  by  about  40  interfaith  leaders,  including  Jews,  Buddhists,  Muslims,  Hindus  and  others,  who  will  meet  privately  with  Pope  Benedict  at  St  Mary's  Cathedral  during  his  first  visit  to  Australia.

"  A  man  walks  through  the  recent  snowstorm  In  the  hotly  contested  cHy  of   Jerusalem.  Photo:  Isranet   Jewish  leaders  debate   Diaspora  role  on  Jerusalem   DINA  KRAFT   JERUSALEM  -  The  object  of  2000  years  of  Jewish  yearning,  Jerusaiem  is  perhaps  the  most  sensitive  topic  on  the  Israeli-Palestinian  negotiating  table.  So  when  it  comes  to  discussing  the  future  -  and  possible  division  -  of  the  city,  Diaspora  Jews  want  their  voices  heard,  too.   The  question  of  how  loud  and  expressive  those  voices  should  be  was  part  of  the  discussion  when  top  US  Jewish  leaders  visited  Israel  last  week  for  the  annual  mission  of  the  Confer  ence  of  Presidents  of  Major  American  Jewish  Organisations,  an  umbrella  organisation  of  51  Jewish  groups.   ""The  Jerusalem  issue  is  different  because  of  its  centrality  to  Jewish  life  and  existence,”  said  Malcom  Hoenlein,  executive  vice-chairman  of  the  conference.   ""The  ultimate  decision  rests  with  the  government  of  Israel,  but  being  sensitive  [to  Diaspora  Jews]  is  legiti  mate,""  he  said.  “Certainly  on  an  issue  of  such  significance  to  people,  we  have  a  right  to  discuss  and  be  heard.”   Tensions  have  been  simmering  over  what  role,  if  any,  Diaspora  Jews  should  play  in  Israeli-Palestinian  negotiations  on  Jerusalem  since  last  November's  peace  summit  in  Annapolis,  Maryland.   At  that  time,  the  Orthodox  Union  reportedly  called  on  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Olmert  not  to  make  any  territorial  compromises  on  Jerusalem.   Israel  annexed  Arab  East  Jerusalem  following  its  capture  from  Jordan  in  the  1967  Six-Day  War,  but  Palestinians   claim  it  as  their  future  capital.  The  150,000  Arabs  who  live  there,  the  emotional  power  and  history  of  its  Old  City,  and  the  patchwork  of  Jewish  neighbourhoods  in  Jerusalem's  east  make  the  issue  especially  difficult  to   resolve.   This  month,  the  issue  of  American  Jewish  advocacy  reappeared  when  World  Jewish  Congress  president  Ronald  Lauder  told  Olmert  that  Dias  pora  Jewish  opinion  must  be  consid  ered  when  it  comes  to  negotiations  over  Jerusalem's  future  status.   An  evidently  angry  Olmert  answered  by  cancelling  a  speech  he  was  supposed  to  give  to  the  group.   In  his  recent  speech,  Olmert  tried  to  strike  a  reassuring  tone,  saying  he  would  not  do  anything  in  negotiations  that  would  compromise  Israel.  He  also  said  talks  on  Jerusalem  with  the  Pales  tinian  Authority  were  not  even  on  the  agenda  at  the  moment   The  Israeli  media,  however,  has  reported  on  secret  back-channel  nego  tiations  on  Jerusalem  being  conducted  by  Foreign  Minister  Tzipi  Livni.   In  a  bid  to  counter  the  impression  that  Diaspora  Jews  uniformly  would  object  to  any  division  of  the  city,  Rabbi  Eric  Yoffie,  president  of  the  Union  for  Reform  Judaism,  said  he  told  Olmert  recently  that  the  Reform  movement,  which  represents  the  largest  Jewish  religious  denomination  in  America,  would  support  Israel’s  decisions  on  Jerusalem  even  if  that  meant  territorial  compromise,  as  long  as  it  was  in   exchange  for  peace.

"  TIGHT  RACES  MEAN  JEWISH   VOTES  COULD  MATTER     AMI  EDEN     NEW  YORK  -  Primary  season  has  tradi-  tionally  been  a  spectator  sport  for  your  average  American  Jewish  voter,  thanks  to  an  electoral  schedule  that  has  his-  torically  favoured  states  with  tiny   Jewish  communities.   This  election,  as  the  nation  readies  for  the  Iowa  caucuses  and  the  New  Hampshire  primary,  it  appears  as  if  the  Jewish  vote  could  play  a  role  in  deciding  the  Democratic  nomination.  That’s  because  many  big  states  have  pushed  up  their  primaries  and  polls  show  a  tightening  race  for  the  Democ-   ratic  nomination.   The  Republican  picture  is  even  tighter  and  more  complicated,  but  with  the  bulk  of  Jews  identifying  as  Democ-  rats,  the  question  is  whether  John  Edwards,  Hillary  Rodham  Clinton  and  Barack  Obama  will  still  be  battling  on  Super  Tuesday  on  February  5,  when  pri-  maries  are  held  in  23  states  with  about  two-thirds  of  the  country’s  Jewish  pop-   ulation.  Just  six  states  are  voting  ahead  of  Super  Tuesday  this  year  -  compared  to  14  states  in  2004  -  which  means  fewer  chances  for  the  race  to  be  wrapped  up  before  Super  Tuesday.  And  with  polls  showing  a  tough  three-way  race  in  Iowa,  and  Obama  and  Clinton  neck-and-neck  in  New  Hampshire  and  South  Carolina,  it  will  be  difficult  for  any  of  the  top  three  Democrats  to  knock  out  the  other  two  before  the  overwhelming  majority  of  American   Jews  vote.   Assuming  the  race  is  still  on  coming  out  of  South  Carolina,  the  nation  could  once  again  end  up  turning  its  collective  eye  to  Jewish  voters  in  South  Florida.  The  Sunshine  State  -  boasting  the  third  largest  Jewish  population  -  is  the  only  state  scheduled  to  hold  a  primary  on  January  29  and  the  last  to  vote  before  Super  Tuesday.  In  addition  to  New  York  and  California,  February  5  will  feature  primaries  in  several  other  states  with  sizeable  Jewish  populations.   JTA ",2008-01-04
"  New  Jewish  cemetery  to  open  in  Perth   NAOMI  LEVIN   PERTH’S  Jewish  community  can  rest  assured  they  will  be  buried  in  a  Jewish  cemetery  for  years  to  come.   Last  week,  the  Perth  Chevra  Kadisha  and  the  Jewish  Community  Council  of  Western  Australia  (JCCWA)  received  confirmation  that  a  plot  of  land  had  been  set  aside  for  a  new  Jewish  burial  area  in  the  Guild  ford  Cemetery.   It  has  been  a  long  time  coming,  with  the  first  moves  towards  a  new  cemetery  commencing  more  than  a  decade  ago.  It  took  years  of  submis  sions  and  petitioning,  from  Jewish  community  leaders  and  also  helpful  local  politicians,  to  secure  the  land.   Dr  Keith  Shilkin  (pictured),  pres  ident  of  the  JCCWA,  said  the  land  at  the  Guildford  Cemetery  was  vacant,  but  there  had  been  environmental  concerns  about  clearing  it.   “There  was  always  support  from  the  Metropolitan  Cemeteries  Board,  because  they  could  see  the  space  starting  to  run  out  for  the  Jewish  community,”  Dr  Shilkin  said.   “The  new  land  was  to  be  allocated  on  land  that  was  already  set  aside  for  a  cemetery  area,  but  this  was  bushland”   While  it  took  some  time  to  over  come  the  environmental  obstacles,  Dr  Shilkin  said  the  community  is   satisfied  with  the  new  site,  which  is  easily  accessible  for  most  Jews,  par  ticularly  those  who  live  in  the   northern  suburbs.   ""The  community  is   satisfied  with  the  new  site.”   DR  KEITH  SHILKIN  President,  Jewish  Community  Council  of  Western  Australia   Currently,  members  of  Perth’s  Jewish  community  are  buried  in  the  Jewish  section  at  the  historic  Kar  rakatta  Cemetery,  which  first  opened   in  1899.   Dr  Shilkin  expects  Perth’s  Jews  to   be  buried  at  Karrakatta  for  some   years  to  come,  so  the  new  Jewish  cemetery  at  Guildford,  which  is  sim  ilar  size  to  Karrakatta,  is  expected  to   lie  dormant  until  needed.   During  that  time,  the  Perth   Chevra  Kadisha  will  meet  with  com   munity  stakeholders  to  discuss  the  development  of  the  new  cemetery.   Perth’s  Jewish  community  is  stable  at  about  8000  people.  Dr  Shilkin  does  not  expect  the  number  to  fluctuate  in  the  near  future  -  with   no  large-scale  migration  predicted  -  so  it  is  likely  that  the  new  cemetery  will  be  used  for  80  years.

"  In  focus   Palin  hits  Jewish  raw  nerve   MARISSA  BROSTOFF   w   HEN  Clare  Kinberg,  edi  tor  of  a  feminist  Jewish  magazine,  set  up  her   booth  at  an  Ann  Arbor   Jewish  community  event,  she  didn’t  expect  to  attract  a  parade  of  women  eager  to  vent  their  rage  against  Sarah  Palin.  But  woman  after  woman  -  per  haps  noticing  Kinberg’s  Barack  Obama  pin  approached  her  to  tell  stories  of  how  John  McCain’s  vice  presidential  pick  had  galvanised  them  into  becoming  active  in  the  Obama  campaign.   “She  really  brought  out  some  ire,  fear,  something  personal,”  said  Kin  berg,  who  edits  the  magazine  Bridges.   “It  was  almost  a  visceral  reaction  that   she  represented  something  anathema  against  Jewish  values,  something  very  deep  in  their  identity.”   On  a  political  level,  it’s  no  surprise  that  liberal  Jewish  women  don’t  like  Palin  -  they  are  liberals,  after  all,  and  Palin  is  an  avowed  and  unabashed  conservative,  in  a  heated  presidential  race.  But  the  Alaska  governor  also  seems  to  strike  a  raw  nerve  on  a  sym  bolic  level  for  many  Jewish  women,  drawing  far  more  indignation  than  a  male  candidate  with  similar  views,  almost  as  if  she  offends  their  sense  of  who  they  are.   “It  was  the  place  in  their  identity  where  they  are  Jewish  women,”  Kin  berg  said  of  the  angry  voters  who  dropped  by  her  booth.  “People  did  n’t  bring  up  specific  things  about  reproductive  rights  or  abortion  or  separation  of  church  and  state,  but  it  was  all  of  those  things  wrapped  up  together.”   Palin’s  attempts  to  woo  both  women  and  Jews  have  made  many  members  of  both  those  groups  resent  what  they  see  as  unwanted  advances.   Despite  being  a  woman  running  for  vice-president  immediately  after  Hillary  Rodham  Clinton’s  defeat  in  the  presidential  primaries,  Palin  has  met  with  disapproval  ratings  from  45  per  cent  of  women  (compared  with  35  per  cent  of  men),  according  to  a  Time  magazine  poll  conducted  in  early  October.   And,  despite  having  cast  herself  as  a  take-no-prisoners  advocate  for  Israel,  Palin  has  garnered  an  approval  rating  of  only  37  per  cent  of  the  Jew  ish  electorate,  according  to  an  Ameri  can  Jewish  Committee  poll  taken  in  September.   “In  the  same  way  I  resent  her  co  opting  a  feminist  message  in  order  to  achieve  a  retrograde  goal,  I  resent  her  pandering  to  the  insecurities  of  American  Jews,”  said  Ayelet  Wald  man,  a  Berkeley,  California-based  writer  who  has  been  volunteering  full  time  with  the  Obama  campaign.   For  some,  the  antipathy  toward  Palin  is  located  even  more  closely  at  the  intersection  of  feminism  and  Jew  ish  identity.  “She’s  the  anti-wonk,  the  anti-intellectual,  someone  who  doesn’t  want  to  brook  differences  of   opinion,”  said  Susan  Weidman  Schneider,  the  editor  of  Lilith,  another  Jewish  feminist  journal.  “She  is  cer  tainly  not  someone  with  whom  I  or  other  Jewish  women  I  know  would  identify.  There’s  a  real  sense  of   alienation.”   For  Schneider,  Palin  represents  the  opposite  of  what  Hillary  Clinton  meant  to  many  women  during  the   Sarah  Palin's  values  are  at  odds  with  most  liberal  Jewish  women.   presidential  primaries.  Schneider  told  The  Forward  several  months  ago  that  she  believed  Jewish  women  identified  with  Clinton  to  the  point  of  almost  reading  the  senator  as  Jewish  herself,  “the  same  way  that  some  people  imagined  Bill  Clinton,  during  his  time  in  office,  to  be  the  first  black  presi  dent”.  Even  the  negative  stereotypes  that  stuck  to  Hillary  Clinton  -  that  she  was  emasculating  or  shrill  -  have  also   been  used  to  tar  Jewish  women,  while  Palin  has  tapped  into  an  entirely  dif  ferent  set  of  signifiers.   The  down-home  charm  that  Palin   projects  in  lieu  of  a  focus  on  nuance  or  detail  is  particularly  off-putting  for  many  Jewish  women,  who  are  likely  to  be  highly  educated,  urban  and  upper-middle  class.   “Most  Jewish  feminists  are  not  part  of  the  class  bas.e  that  she’s  meant   to  appeal  to,”  said  Alisa  Solomon,  a  professor  of  journalism  at  Columbia  University.  “So  when  she’s  deliber  ately  dropping  her  ‘g’s  and  throwing  out  her  ‘y°u  betchas’,  that  doesn’t  appeal  to  us.  We’re  not  the  audience   for  it”   More  so  than  Obama  or  McCain,  Palin  seems  to  “read”  in  basically  the  same  way  across  the  political  spec  trum,  with  voters  mostly  in  agree  ment  about  what  Palin  represents,  but  differing  -  vastly  -  in  how  they  feel  about  those  representations.  Palin’s  admirers  among  Jewish  women,  fittingly,  seem  to  be  concen  trated  most  heavily  in  Orthodox  communities,  where  her  image  as  a  religious  person  and  an  upholder  of  family  values  resonates.   “Most  of  the  women  I’ve  talked  to  from  my  circles  seemed  to  like  her,  at  least  at  first,”  said  Baila  Olidort,  the  editor  of  Lubavitch.com,  the  website  of  the  Chabad-Lubavitch  movement.  “When  she  was  first  introduced,  I  thought,  ‘This  is  terrific.’”   Olidort  said  that  she  has  had  sec   ond  thoughts  since  Palin’s  weak  inter  view  performances,  and  that  she  has  not  yet  decided  how  she  will  vote  -  but  that  on  an  ideological  level,  Palin’s  “views  are  aligned  quite  well  with  tra  ditional  Jewish  views”.   Opinion  on  Palin  seems  to  be  split  among  Jews  who  are  observant  but  not  ultra-Orthodox  -  a  swing-voting  demographic  that  both  parties  would   like  to  nab.

"  FIRST  JEWISH  STEM-CELL  DRIVE  IN  BYRON     BENJAMIN  LEVY     FOR  the  first  time  in  its  history,  Gift  of  Life  Australia  will  conduct  a  drive  for  Jewish  bone-marrow  and  stem-  cell  donors  in  Byron  Bay.   The  organisation  will  conduct  the  donor  drive  over  the  Australia  Day  weekend  under  the  auspices  of  the  Red  Cross.  It  will  operate  as  a  major  effort  to  save  the  fives  of  sev-  eral  Jewish  leukaemia  patients.   Because  tissue  type  is  inherited,  Jewish  patients  have  a  greater  chance  of  finding  a  match  from  a  donor  of  the  same  ethnic  background  -  the  chances  of  finding  an  unrelated  donor  are  as  few  as  1  in  50,000.   While  Gift  of  Life  Australia  has  had   previous  donor  drives  in  areas,  such  as  Sydney  and  Melbourne,  this  is  the  first   time  it  has  tapped  into  the  local  Jewish  community  in  Byron  Bay.

"  Jewish  leaders  hold  court  with  the  Pope   CHANTALABITBOL   THE  historic  meeting  between  Pope  Benedict  XVI  and  a  select  group  of  Jewish  leaders  culminated  last  week  with  both  sides  expressing  a  deep  commitment  to  peace,  unity  and  ongoing  dialogue.   The  meeting  took  place  last  Friday,  July  18,  at  St  Mary’s  Cathedral  Crypt  as  part  of  World  Youth  Day  celebra   tions.  About  40  interfaith  leaders  attended,  including  Jews,  Buddhists,  Muslims,  Hindus  and  others.   Pope  Benedict,  on  his  first  visit  to  Australia,  thanked  the  leaders  for  their  work  within  their  communities  and  declared:  “I  have  come  to  Aus  tralia  as  an  ambassador  of  peace  ...  and  I  feel  blessed  to  meet  you  who,  likewise,  share  this  yearning.  Our  quest  for  peace  goes  hand-in-hand  with  our  search  for  meaning.”   Speaking  on  behalf  of  the  Jewish  community,  Rabbi  Jeremy  Lawrence,  senior  minister  of  The  Great  Syna  gogue,  greeted  the  Pope,  and  said   that  such  encounters  served  to   emphasise  “our  shared  concerns”  for  the  environment,  humankind  and  social  justice.   “Our  faiths  teach  that  we  are  all  children  of  one  body,  cast  in  God’s  image,”  he  said.  “Though  we  may  dif  fer  profoundly  in  the  details  or  inter  pretations,  our  shared  points-of-origin  should  bind  us  together  with  an  amity.”   Rabbi  Lawrence  also  emphasised  the  importance  of  continued  inter   Rabbi  JeremyLawrence  greeted   .

Afterwards,  those  in  attendance   lined  up  to  personally  greet  Pope   Benedict.   Josie  Lacey,  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  (BOD)  interfaith  chair,  even  enjoyed  the  opportunity  to  practice  her  German.  “I  told  him  my  mother  came  from  Frankfurt  am  Main,”  she  said.  “He  was  gentle,  lovely.

It's  been  many  years  working  towards  a  dialogue.”   The  Jewish  delegation  also  included  David  Knoll,  BOD  president;  Rabbi  Jef  frey  Kamins,  chief  minister  of.

"  ERIC  FINGERHUT   THE  only  Jewish  Republican  in  the  US  House  of  Representatives  is  poised  to  take  the  mantle  of  the  vanquished  party’s  second-highest  ranking  representative.   Eric  Cantor  of  Virginia  is  likely  to  ascend  to  the  minority  whip  position  in  the  House  after  another  Republican  law  maker,  Roy  Blunt  of  Missouri,  stepped  down  from  the  post  on  November  6.   Cantor,  45,  has  served  as  chief  deputy  whip  for  the  past  six  years  and  has  been  considered  a  rising  star  in  the  Republican  Party  since  his  election  to  the  House  in  2000.   As  someone  who  could  appeal  to  two  key  constituencies  -  Jews  and  conserva  tives  -  Cantor's  name  was  even  floated  this  summer  as  a  possible  vice-presiden  tial  pick  for  John  McCain.

"  The  Jewish  guilt  trip   TORAH  TOPIC   RABBI  ELISHA  GREENBAUM   שמיני  פרה   IIM  If  form  of  guilt  trips  does   vWWf  your  mother  use?  Does  she   m  W  insist  on  feeding  you  the  good  stuff  while  saving  the  inferior  cooking  for  herself?  How  many  times  does  she  have  to  suggest  meaningfully  that  she’s  not  getting  older  and  would  dearly   love  to  see  ...  before  it’s  too  late?  And   does  she  remind  you  that  she  shlepped  you  around  for  nine  months,  suffered  through  labour  and...  ?   In  God’s  own  way,  He  does  much  the  same  thing.  Throughout  the  Torah,  in  diverse  contexts,  we  are  forcibly  reminded  about  one  specific   debt  to  God:   “Don’t  lend  money  on  interest...  I  am  Hashem,  who  took  you  out  of  Egypt”   “Wear  tzizit  ...  I  took  you  out  of  Egypt”   “You  shall  have  honest  scales...  I  am  your  God  who  has  taken  you  out  of  Egypt”   But  this  isn’t  just  God  doing  a  guilt  trip  on  us.  The  Talmud  (Baba  Metzia  61a)  points  out  that  it  is  a  cautionary  reminder,  particularly  regarding  trans  gressions  almost  impossible  to  trace  and  punish  under  a  human  justice  sys   tem.  Only  God,  who  rescued  us  from  Egypt,  is  capable  of  policing  and  punishing.   Just  as  Hashem  distinguished  between  friend  and  foe,  believer  and  sceptic,  and  even  ferreted  through  the  Egyptian  gene  pool  to  trace  the  first  borns  among  them,  so  too  will  he  dis  cern  anyone  who  falsely  and  perversely  lends  money  on  interest  through  a  third  party,  sells  fake  religious  articles   or  fiddles  with  his  business  scales.   But  near  the  end  of  this  week’s   Torah  reading,  amid  the  laws  of  kosher  animals  and  food,  we  find  there  is  more  to  the  story:   “And  you  shall  sanctify  yourself  and  you  shall  become  holy  ...  for  I  am  Hashem  who  elevated  you  from  the  land  of  Egypt  to  be  your  God.”   Leaving  Egypt  was  not  just  a  reality  revealing  God’s  power,  but  is  depicted  as  having  an  elevating  effect.  Just  as  the  process  of  exchanging  slavery  for  free  dom  was  not  just  a  development  but  a  leap  from  one  level  of  existence  to  a  higher,  so  too  the  undertaking  to  emu  late  Hashem  in  one’s  daily  actions  has  the  potential  to  radically  transform  one  from  a  dreary,  cloistered  individ  ual,  into  a  creature  of  Godliness  —  ele  vated  and  holy.   And  all  mitzvot  requiring  us  to  think  of  God  before  we  act  have  a  sim  ilar  impact  on  every  Jew.

"  Baptist  minister’s  hellish   comments  spark  Jewish  ire   CHANTAl  ABSTBOL   A  WOLLONGONG  Baptist  minister  has  admitted  he  told  two  Jewish  emis  saries  that  Jews  suffer  from  a  sin  affliction,  and  will  face  a  fate  “worse  than  the  Holocaust”  because  they  don’t  accept  Jesus  as  the  messiah.   The  comments  have  sparked  out  rage  among  Jewish  groups  and  inter   faith  leaders.   American-born  Pastor  Kevin  Har  ris,  of  the  Illawarra  Community  Bap  tist  Church,  made  the  comments  in  a  private  meeting  last  Thursday  with  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  (JBD)  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  and  educa  tion  manager  Lynda  Ben-Menashe,  who  were  touring  the  area  on  a  bridge-building  exercise  as  part  of  the  JBD’s  speaker  service.   Pastor  Harris  said  he  told  them  that  anyone  who  did  not  accept  Jesus  suffered  from  a  “cancer”  and  that  Jews  were  doomed  to  face  “a  period  of  tribulation  worse  than  the  Holo  caust”,  according  to  Christian  scripture.   “We  don’t  wish  this  ill  time  upon  them.  We  love  the  Jewish  people.  [I’m]  just  quoting  Jesus,”  the  Ameri  can-born  Pastor  Harris  told  The  AJN.  “All  of  us  have  the  cancer  of  sin,  and  there’s  one  solution:  Jesus  Christ.  I  liken  it  to  cancer  to  show  that  it’s  fatal.  Those  of  us  who  reject  Jesus  as  the  saviour  ...  all  of  us,  Jew  or  Gentile,  would  spend  eternity  without  God  in   hell”   Alhadeff  said  it  was  a  “chilling  experience”  to  be  on  the  receiving  end  of  the  pastor’s  comments.   Pastor  Kevin   Harris  told  Hie  AJN:  ""Anybody  that  does  not  receive  Jesus   Christ  is  going  to  hell  of  their  own  choice.”   “We  told  him  we  appreciated  the  candour  of  his  remarks,  but  found  his  position  completely  unaccept  able,”  Alhadeff  said.  “While  one  is  only  too  aware  that  there  are  funda   mentalist  beliefs  and  extremist   preachers  out  there,  his  brazen  approach  and  the  fact  that  he  is  influ  encing  others  on  a  daily  basis  are  the   issues  of  real  concern  ”   CONTINUED  ON  NEWS  4   Minister’s  hellish  comments   CONTINUED  FROM  NEWS  1   Peta  Jones  Pellach,  an  expert  in  interfaith  relations,  said  she  does  not  believe  the  pastor's  comments  reflected  the  official  views  of  churches  throughout  Australia.   ""Unfortunately,  nutters  can  also  become  Christian  ministers,”  she  said.  ""I  think  any  of  the  organised  churches  would  be  horrified.”   Jones  Pellach  added  that  the  com  ments  highlighted  the  current  challenges  facing  interfaith  work.  ""Sometimes  when  someone  makes  extreme  comments  like  these,  the  church  recognises  they  have  more  work  to  do,  in  terms  of  spreading  the  true  Christian  message,  which  is  not  about  vilifying  Jews.”   Australian  Council  of  Christian  and  Jews  past-president  Henry  Mendelson  added:  ""This  sort  of  thing  has  to  stop.  We  have  to  accept  that  we’re  not  living  in  a  Bible-belt  society,  and  that  we've  pro  gressed  from  the  narrowness  of  the  atti  tude  that  one  religion  is  superior  to  another.”   NSW  Baptist  Union  general-secretary  Alan  Soden  said  Pastor  Harris  was  not  a  registered  member  of  the  union  and  declined  to  comment  specifically  on  his  comments,  but  stressed  the  Baptist  Church  respected  the  rights  of  other  faiths  to  have  their  own  views.  “Major  world  religions  have  many  differences  and  a  person  of  faith  should  not  be  expected  to  commit  intellectual  suicide,  in  order  to  follow  a  particular  faith.

"  DAVBD  BENKOF,  a  gay  Orthodox  Jew,  who   has  remained  celibate  for  more  than  seven   years,  questions  the  use  of  ‘ex-gay’  terminology.   If  the  Jewish  “ex-gay”  advocates  knew   anything  about  Judaism  and  homosexuality,  they  wouldn't  endorse   Christian  psychoanalytic  ideas,  such  as  ""healing  same-sex  attractions”.   SINCE  2002,  when  I  started   becoming  open  about  my  per  sonal  religious  choice  to  stop  having  same-sex  relations,  liberals  on   gay  issues  have  repeatedly  accused  me  of  being  a  Jewish  “ex-gay”.  But  I  am  no  such  thing,  because  Torah  Judaism  doesn’t  have  a  concept  of  an  “ex-gay”.   I  have  no  doubt  that  some  peo  ple’s  sexualities  change.  I  have  met  many  people  who  say  it  has  hap  pened  to  diem.  But  I’m  sceptical  of  those  who  credit  their  “reorientation”  therapists.  I  just  don’t  see  the  evi   dence  that  it  works.   In  the  process  of  writing  Judaism  and  Homosexuality:  an  Authentic  Orthodox  View,  the  only  significant  full-length  study  of  homosexuality  and  Jewish  law,  Rabbi  Chaim  Rapoport  asked  Jews  Offering  New  Alternatives  to  Homosexuality  (JONAH)  if  he  could  speak  to  some  “success  stories”.  He  was  unsatisfied  with  their  meager  response.   Similarly,  while  I  have  spoken  to  about  two  dozen  JONAH  men  on  the  internet,  phone,  and  in  person,  I  have  never  encountered  a  single  Jew  who  was  gay  (not  bisexual)  and  became  straight  (not  bisexual)  due  to  tech  niques  recommended  by  JONAH.  If  their  approach  was  effective,  shouldn’t  there  be  some  men  and  women  I  could  speak  with  who  say   that  JONAH  did  for  them  what  it  claims  to  be  able  to  do?   Can  prayer  change  one’s  sexuality?  I  don’t  see  why  not  As  an  Orthodox  Jew,  I  certainly  support  people  pray  ing  for  any  change  they  want  —  from  a  new  sexuality  to  more  patience.  If  I  didn’t  believe  God  listens  to  prayers  (although  not  always  responding  like  a  genie),  I  wouldn’t  see  the  point  in  praying  at  all.  And  anyone  struggling  to  bring  his  behaviours  in  line  with  his  values  could  benefit  from  a  good  therapist.   But  that’s  not  the  focus  of  the   “reparative  therapy”  promoted  to  many  Jews  struggling  with  same-sex  attractions.  People  pay  hundreds  of  dollars  to  poseurs  like  Dr  Joseph  Nicolosi,  who  tell  them  their  homo  sexuality  stems  from  problematic  parenting,  but  that  they  can  release  their  inner  heterosexual  through  resolving  trauma  that  exists  only  in  the  therapist’s  imagination,  hyper  masculine  or  hyperfeminine  role  playing,  “gender-appropriate”  activi  ties,  such  as  baseball  and  sewing,  and  other  “muck”  I  don’t  have  the  stom  ach  to  describe.  Even  the  largest  “ex  gay”  group,  Exodus  International,  no  longer  has  much  use  for  Dr  Nicolosi  or  his  discredited  therapy.   If  the  Jewish  “ex-gay”  advocates  knew  anything  about  Judaism  and  homosexuality,  they  wouldn’t   endorse  Christian  psychoanalytic  ideas,  such  as  “healing  same-sex  attractions”,  “becoming  heterosex  ual”  and  the  “false  identity  of  homo  sexuality”.  Their  offer  to  help  gays  “recover  their  heterosexual  poten  tial”  is  clearly  lifted  from  Dr  Nicolosi’s  Catholic  natural-law  phi  losophy.  While  Jewish  law  certainly  calls  for  sexuality  to  be  channeled  into  opposite-sex  relationships,  no  notion  that  we’re  all  inherentiy  straight  appears  in  any  Jewish  text.   The  Torah  knows  no  sexual  orienta  tions  -  which  is  the  point  of  Rabbi  Joel  Beasley’s  important  1998  Jewish  Spectator  article  “Why  Neither  Homosexuality  nor  Heterosexuality  Exist  in  Judaism”.   Many  outspoken  Jewish  support  ers  of  the  “ex-gay”  movement  are  non-observant  Jews.  One  Jewish  woman  who  wanted  to  encourage  me  to  become  “ex-gay”  sent  me  an  email  -  on  Shabbat  -  to  suggest  some  reparative  therapy  websites.  I  wrote  her  back  to  let  her  know  that  (and  I  confirmed  this  with  an  Orthodox  rabbi)  if  she  had  to  violate  one  commandment,  it  would  have  been  better  for  her  to  engage  in  les  bian  sex  than  for  her  to  email  me  on  Shabbat.  She  became  very  hostile.  No  serious  practicing  Jew  would  let  such  people  supervise  their  kosher  meat,  so  why  should  we  trust  them   with  Jews  struggling  with  same-sex   attractions?   JONAH’s  confusion  about  Judaism  and  homosexuality  is  most  evident  in  its  comfort  with  pointing  Jewish  gays  and  lesbians  toward  learning  about  Christian  ideas  about  homosexuality.  For  example,  jonah  web.org  recommends  Homosexual  ity  and  the  Politics  of  Truth  by  Jewish  psychiatrist  Dr  Jeffrey  Satinover.  I  read  that  book  in  2002  when  my  rabbi  told  me  it  was  JONAH  endorsed.  Dr  Satinover  quotes  the  New  Testament  far  more  than  any  Jewish  source.  The  views  of  the  apostle  Paul  appear  on  more  than  a  dozen  pages.  The  executive  vice  president  of  one  organisation  JONAH  has  promoted  used  to  have  a  policy  (until  I  demanded  its  rever  sal)  of  refusing  to  talk  to  any  Jews,  no  matter  how  observant,  unless  he  was  allowed  to  evangelise  them  for  Christ.  Indeed,  I  met  one  young  man  at  a  Jewish  conference  who  confided  in  me  that  he  had  partici  pated  in  many  of  the  “ex-gay”  organisations  promoted  by  JONAH  and  now  accepts  Jesus.   I  would  love  to  see  a  Torah-true   organisation  for  same-sex-attracted  Jews  who,  on  their  own,  seek  help  in  following  Judaism’s  guidelines  for  family  and  bedroom  life.  Alas,  such  an  organisation  does  not  yet  exist ",2008-08-29
"  In  focus   An  uneven  history  of  Jewish  pirates   ADAM  KIRSCH   NEW  YORK  (NEX1BOOK)  -  There  are  places  you  expect  to  find  Jews  and  places  you  don’t,  and  in  the  second  category,  the  deck  of  a  pirate  ship  ranks  pretty  close  to  the  top.  The  very  title  of  Jewish  Pirates  of  the  Caribbean  sounds  like  the  premise  of  a  science  fiction  novel  -  maybe  a  sequel  to   Michael  Chabon’s  The  Yiddish  Police   men’s  Union,  in  which  Yiddish-speak  ing  Jews  colonise  Alaska  -  or  else  the  punchline  to  a  joke.  But  Edward  Krit  zler’s  new  book,  despite  its  serious  flaws  of  scholarship  and  interpreta  tion,  has  the  merit  of  reminding  us  that,  in  fact,  Jews  and  the  descendants  of  Jews  played  a  significant  role  in  the  European  colonisation  of  the  New  World  as  merchants,  diplomats,  spies,  and  yes,  even  pirates.   The  reason  has  to  do  with  simple  chronology:  1492,  known  to  all  Americans  as  the  year  Columbus  sailed  the  ocean  blue,  is  remembered  by  Jews  in  a  very  different  spirit  -  as  the  year  Ferdinand  and  Isabella  ban  ished  the  Jews  from  Spain.  In  the  ensuing  diaspora,  many  Spanish  and  Portuguese  Jews,  including  the  con  versos  who  continued  to  practise  Judaism  in  secret,  found  their  way  to  mercantile  centres  across  Europe  and  the  New  World.  They  were,  after  all,  a  well-connected,  well-educated  and  well-capitalised  bourgeoisie,  ideally  suited  to  play  the  role  of  middlemen  in  the  emerging  global  economy.  It  is   no  wonder  that  conversos  sailed  with   Columbus  -  a  durable  legend  has  it   that  Columbus  himself  was  from  a   Jewish  family  -  or  that  Kritzler  finds  thriving  Sephardic  communities  in  Jamaica,  Brazil  and  New  Amsterdam.  Wherever  the  Spanish  or  Dutch  planted  their  flags,  at  least  some  Jews   were  sure  to  follow.   And  at  least  a  few  of  those  Jews  were  actual  pirates.  At  a  time  when  the  boundaries  between  war,  com  merce  and  piracy  were  highly  porous,   it  was  easy  for  Jewish  sailors  and  shipowners  to  mingle  peaceful  trade  missions  with  privateering.  Take  Samuel  Palache,  a  descendant  of  Moroccan  rabbis  who  started  his  career  of  international  intrigue  as  a  trade  representative,  exchanging  Moorish  jewels  for  Spanish  beeswax.  He  tried  to  enter  the  service  of  King  Philip  III  of  Spain,  even  offering  to   convert  to  Catholicism.  When  the   offer  was  declined,  he  signed  up  with  Philip’s  deadly  enemies,  the  Dutch,  and  began  running  guns  from  Hol  land  to  North  Africa.  As  part  of  this  campaign  of  harassing  the  Spanish,   Palache  once  led  a  fleet  to  attack   Spanish  shipping  in  the  Mediter  ranean.  While  “the  result  of  this  expe  dition  is  not  reported”,  Kritzler  admits,  it  is  enough  for  him  to  grant  Palache  the  dashing  nickname  “The  Pirate  Rabbi”.  (Even  so,  the  reader  cannot  help  noticing  that  he  never  set  foot,  or  sail,  in  the  Caribbean  -  Krit  zler’s  title  is  more  catchy  than  precise.)   Kritzler  even  stakes  a  Jewish  claim  on  one  of  the  marquee  names  in  pirate  history,  Jean  Lafitte,  the  patriot  buccaneer  who  ran  a  smuggling  empire  from  New  Orleans  in  the  early  19th  century,  then  redeemed  himself  by  fighting  with  Andrew  Jackson  against  the  British  in  the  war  of  1812.  Kritzler  quotes  Lafitte  himself  on  the  importance  of  his  Jewish  ancestry:   “My  grandmother  was  a  Spanish   Israelite.  ...  Grandmother  told  me   repeatedly  of  the  trials  and  tribula   tions  her  ancestors  had  endured  at   the  time  of  the  Spanish  Inquisition.  ...  Grandmother’s  teachings  ...  inspired  in  me  a  hatred  of  the  Spanish  Crown  and  all  the  persecutions  for  which  it  was  responsible  -  not  only  against  Jews.”   The  oppressed  becomes  the  foe  of  oppressors,  the  beaten-down  Jew  takes  up  a  cutlass:  it  is  an  irresistible  story  line  and  the  central  premise  of   Kritzler’s  book.  If  Lafitte’s  confession   seems  to  illustrate  it  almost  too  conve   niently,  that  maybe   because  it  is  almost   certainly  fictional  According  to  his  notes,  Kritzler  found  the  quotation  in  a  book  about  the  l^story  of  Jewish   New  Orleans,  where  it  is  cited  from  The  Journal  of  Jean  Lafitte,  a  book  published  in  New  York  in  1958.  Nowhere  in  his  text  or  notes,  how  ever,  does  Kritzler  mention  what  it  took  me  only  moments  to  find  out  on  the  internet  —  that  The  Journal  of  Jean  Lafitte  was  the  work  of  a  notorious  forger  named  John  Laflin,  who   claimed  to  be  a  descendant  of  the   pirate  and  also  invented  documents  related  to  Davy  Crockett  and  Abra  ham  Lincoln.  There  is  no  way  of  telling  from  Jewish  Pirates  of  the   Caribbean  whether  Kritzler  thinks  he   has  a  good  reason  to  trust  the  Journal  anyway,  or  if  he  is  even  aware  of  its  true  provenance.   J“His  New  World  cousins   were  adventurers  after  my  own  heart  Jewish  explorers,   conquistadors,  cowboys,  and  yes,  pirates”.   EDWARD  KRITZLER  Author,  Jewish  Pirates  of  the   Caribbean   The  Lafitte  example  is  a  minor  one  -  he  appears  on  only  two  pages  of  the  book  -  but  it  is  unfortunately  typical  of  Kritzler’s  way  with  historical  evi  dence.  Kritzler  relies  heavily  on  the  work  of  reputable  historians  in  put  ting  together  his  picture  of  Jews  in  the   New  World  in  the  16th  and  17th  cen   turies.  But  wherever  there  is  a  gap  in  the  evidence,  he  is  more  than  happy  to  fill  it  with  wild  speculation.  Partic  ularly  unsettling  is  his  practice  of  treating  as  true  the  desperate   vV»/   admissions  of  conversos  put  to  torture  by  the  Inquisition  -  as  when  he  refers,  admiringly,  to  the  Brotherhood  of  the  Jews  of  Holland,  “a  clandestine  group  dedicated  to  fighting  the  Inqui   sition”  whose  “existence  was  revealed  in  the  tortured  con  fessions  of  four  convicted  Judaizers”.  Evidently  Kritzler  believes  as  strongly  as  Torquemada  in  the  power   of  the  rack  to  elicit  truth.   Suffice  it  to  say  that  Jew  ish  Pirates  of  the  Caribbean   concludes  with  Kritzler’s  claim  to  have  discovered  the  location  of  a  secret   gold  mine  belonging  to   Christopher  Columbus  on  the  island  of  Jamaica,  where  Kritzler  lives.  He  even  reproduces  a  17th  century  code  allegedly  pointing  to  the  exact  loca   tion  of  the  mine  and  invites  “the  first  reader”  who  cracks  it  “to  join  our  quixotic  search”.   Kritzler  is  welcome  to  his  gold  mine,  and  I  hope  for  his  sake  that  X  does  the  mark  the  spot.  But  the  quixotic  ""search  he  has  really  embarked  on  in  Jewish  Pirates  of  the   Caribbean  is  a  less  innocent  one.  His   book  is  the  latest  product  of  what  might  be  called  the  “Tough  Jews”  school  of  history-writing,  after  the  1998  book  by  Rich  Cohen.  Cohen’s  book  was  a  paean  to  Jews  such  as  Arnold  Rothstein  and  Meyer  Lansky  -  murderers  and  gangsters,  or  as  Cohen  lovingly  described  them,  “Jews  acting  in  ways  other  than  Jews  are  supposed  to  act,  Jews  leaving  the   world  of  their  heads  to  thrive  in  a  physical  world,  a  world  of  sense,  of  smell,  of  grit,  of  strength,  of  courage,  of  pain.”   By  flattening  out  the  immensely  complex  story  of  the  conversos  and  their  motives  into  a  straightforward  parable  of  freedom-loving,  Spain   hating   Jewish  buccaneers,   Kritzler  is  catering  to  the  same  Amer  ican  Jewish  thirst  for  examples  of  Jew  ish  toughness.  “Forget  the  Mercham  of  Venice,  “  he  writes,  “his  New  World  cousins  were  adventurers  after  m&gt;  own  heart:  Jewish  explorers,  conquis  tadors,  cowboys,  and  yes,  pirates”.   I  get  it;  I  grew  up  riding  the  Pirates  of  the  Caribbean  at  Disneyland.  Bui  there  is  something  strange  about  the  way  American  Jews,  the  most  secure  prosperous  and  assimilated  Jews  in  history,  keep  returning  to  tales  of  Jew  ish  violence  and  thuggery  to  affirm  their  potency.  Jewish  pirates,  like  non  Jewish  pirates,  were  basically  killers  and  thieves,  and  often  slave  traders  to  boot.  Surely  there  are  enough  exam  ples  of  courage  in  Jewish  history  -  physical  and  also  moral  -  that  we  don’t  need  Samuel  Palache  to  prove  that  Jews,  too,  can  be  brave.   m   Adam  Kirsch  is  the  author  of  Benjamin  Disraeli,  a  new  biography  in  Nextbook’s  Jewish  Encounters  series.

"  Israeli  -  or  Jewish?  That  was  the  question   RABBI  LEVI  BRACKMAN  looks  at  recent  surveys  indicating  that  Jewish  tradition  is  alive  and  well  in  the  Jewish  State.   Among  those  who  said  they  were  traditionalist,  55  per  cent  saw   themselves  as  Jewish  and  35  per  cent  as  Israelis.  Within  the   secular  community,  49  percent  said  they  saw  themselves  as  Israeli  first  and  34  per  cent  said  they  were  Jewish   first  and  Israeli  second.   SIXTY  years  after  Israel  was   established  as  the  Jewish  State,  the  question  has  been  asked:  is  the  population  of   Israel  Jewish  first  and  Israeli  second,  or  vice  versa?   An  ongoing  study  performed  by  the  Israel  Democracy  Institute  (IDI)  reveals  that  47  per  cent  of  the  public  sees  itself  as  Jewish  first  and  Israeli  second,  as  opposed  to  39  per  cent  who  consider  themselves  first  and  foremost  Israeli.   According  to  the  IDI’s  Guttman  Centre,  which  published  the  data  last  week  on  Ynet,  94  per  cent  of  the  Jewish  population  in  Israel  views  itself  as  part  of  the  worldwide  Jew  ish  community  -  68  per  cent  think  Jews  living  in  Israel  share  the  same  destiny  as  those  living  in  the  Dias  pora.  The  study  was  based  on  an  ongoing  survey  undertaken  by  the  Guttman  Centre  among  Jews  in  the   country.   Those  taking  part  were  asked  to  rank  the  way  they  perceived  their  identity  by  order  of  importance.  A  total  of  47  per  cent  of  the  respon  dents  said  they  were  Jewish,  39  per  cent  said  they  were  Israeli,  10  per  cent  based  their  identity  on  their  religious  affiliation  and  four  per   cent  based  their  affilication  accord  ing  to  their  ethnic  denomination.   A  closer  look  at  the  religious  com  munity  showed  that  the  more  devout  the  sector,  the  stronger  the  Jewish  definition:  Some  78  per  cent  of  those  identifying  themselves  as  Charedim  and  73  per  cent  of  their  religious  counterparts  chose  the  Jewish  iden  tity  over  the  Israeli  one,  with  0  per  cent  and  16  per  cent  (respectively)  choosing  to  define  themselves  as   Israelis.   Among  those  who  said  they  were  traditionalist,  55  per  cent  saw  them  selves  as  Jewish  and  35  per  cent  as   Israelis.  Within  the  secular  commu  nity,  49  per  cent  said  they  saw  them  selves  as  Israeli  first  and  34  per  cent  said  they  were  Jewish  first  and  Israeli   second.   As  for  the  Arab  sector,  the  polling  data  showed  that  the  major   Students  recite  the  blessing  over  candles  at  New  York's  Binghamton  University  Chabad  House.  The  Israel  Democracy  Institute  study  found  that  36  per  cent  of  Israeli  families  that  define  themselves  as  secular  still  light  Shabbat  candles.   ity  of  Israeli  Arabs  see  themselves  as  Palestinian  or  as  Arab,  and  only  a  small  percentage  of  community   members  see  themselves  as  Israeli.   Forty-five  per  cent  said  they  were  Arab,  24  per  cent  think  of  them  selves  as  Palestinians,  19  per  cent  define  themselves  by  their  religious  affiliation  and  only  12  per  cent  said  they  were  Israelis.   The  second  part  of  the  study  takes   a  closer  look  at  the  current  data  in  comparison  to  similar  surveys  taken  in  1991  and  1999.  The  data  showed   that  the  overall  feeling  of  belonging  to  a  “greater  community”  among  Jews  has  remained  unchanged,  despite  a  certain  decline  in  the  belief  in  a  common  destiny  with  Diaspora  Jews.   The  Guttman  Centre  goes  on  to  quote  a  poll  undertaken  in  2007,  which  found  that  76  per  cent  of  Jews  living  in  Israel  felt  they  shared  the  same  destiny  as  their  brethren  abroad;  the  2008  poll  pegged  the   number  at  68  per  cent.   In  a  related  story,  a  recent  survey  conducted  for  the  Israel  Progressive  Movement  found  that  38  per  cent  of  secular  Jews  living  in  Israel  keep  kosher  often  or  at  all  times,  while  36  per  cent  of  Israeli  families  that  define  themselves  as  secular  light  Shabbat  candles.  The  survey’s  results  were  presented  at  the  movement’s  recent  conference  at  Kibbutz  Shefayim.  According  to  the  survey,  50  per  cent  of  Israeli  Jews  don’t  keep  kosher  at  all  times,  and  47  per  cent  of  secular  fam  ilies  never  light  Shabbat  candles.  Twenty  per  cent  of  the  respondents  said  they  go  to  synagogue  on  a  regu  lar  basis,  while  42  per  cent  said  they  never  attend  prayer  services.   Among  traditional  Jews  living  in  Israel,  67  per  cent  go  to  synagogue  regularly,  87  per  cent  light  Shabbat  candles  every  Friday  and  94  per  cent  keep  kosher.   When  asked  what  religious  move  ment  they  feel  closer  to,  49  per  cent  of   secular  Israeli  Jews  said  they  identify  with  the  Progressive  Movement,  while  only  10  per  cent  of  those  polled  said  they  identify  with  the  Orthodox.  One-quarter  of  secular  Israelis  said  they  do  not  identify  with  any  religious   movement.   The  poll  furthermore  revealed  that  71  per  cent  of  secular  Israelis  are  in  favour  of  adding  liberal  Jewish  con  tent  to  the  school  curriculum,  as  opposed  to  24  per  cent  who  said  they  were  against  the  idea.   Respondents  who  defined  them  selves  as  secular  represent  Israel’s  more  affluent  sector  as  far  as  educa  tion  and  income  are  concerned.   This  segment  of  the  population  considers  democracy  to  be  the  high   est  value  and  identifies  with  mod  ern  Judaism.   While  not  as  prosperous,  tradi  tional  Israelis  play  an  important  role  in  bridging  the  gap  between  secular   and  Orthodox  Israelis.   YNETNEWS.COM ",2008-06-13
"  A  Jewish  state  or  a  state  for  Tews?   RABBI  RAYMOND  APPLE   I  T  is  humbug  on  a  global  scale  to   deny  that  Israel  is  a  (why  not  use  the  definite  article  “the”?)  Jewish   state.   Among  ourselves  as  Jews,  how  ever,  we  should  be  debating  another  aspect  the  question  of  how  Jewish  Israel  is  qualitatively  a  Jewish  state,  or  merely  quantitatively  a  state  where,  demographically  speaking,  most  people  are  Jews?   If  I  ask  my  own  family,  the  ques  tion  will  probably  be  met  with  a  bemused,  “What  are  you  talking  about?  Why  did  we  make  aliyah  after  all,  if  not  because  of  Israel’s  Jewish   ness?”   Three  of  my  four  children,  with  their  spouses  and  children,  plus  my  wife  and  myself,  all  made  aliyah  because  we  believe  Israel  is,  as  Edmond  Fleg  said,  the  land  in  which  God  dwells;  because,  as  the  sages  said,  “Avira  d’ar’a  mach’kim  -  The  air  of  the  Land  makes  you  wise.”  You  breathe  an  inherent  Jewish  feeling  in  Israel,  even  in  the  apparently  least  promising  comers  of  the  country.  All  the  hostile  humbug  that  denies  a  his  toric  Jewish  quality  about  Israel  can  not  take  away  this  basic  fact.   Once  it  could  have  been  argued  that  the  majority  of  Israelis  had  a  less  romantic  view  and  practised  a  Jewish  form  of  secularism.  Now  there  is  a  different  reality.  Recently,  the  media  reported  that  growing  numbers  of  Israelis  call  themselves  religious  or  traditional,  whatever  the  definition  of  those  terms.  I  used  to  aver,  perhaps  out  of  naivete,  that  at  least  in  Jerusalem  even  the  atheists  believed  in  God;  now  I  am  finding  that  I  was  not  so  wrong,  and  not  just  in  regard  to  Jerusalem.   So  now  it  seems  as  though  Israel   r   nas  uiraea  out  to  nave  a  spiritual   heart  after  all.  You  would  naturally  expect  such  statements  from  a  rabbi.  But  rabbis  cannot  be  discounted  when  it  comes  to  views  on  Judaism.  And  even  those  who  normally  have  little  patience  with  rabbis  are  unlikely  to  disagree  when  rabbis  say  that  reli  gion  is  historically  the  most  distinc  tive  quality  of  Jewish  identity.  Even  those  who  normally  boast  about  how  little  religion  there  is  in  their  own  Jewish  make-up  use  religious  criteria  to  define  their  position:  “I  never  go  to  a  synagogue  ...  I  don’t  light  Shabbat  candles  ...  I  don’t  keep  kosher.”  In  other  words,  .they  cannot  define  themselves  as  Jews  without  using  Judaism  as  their  yardstick;  and  even  then  they  may  surprise  themselves  at  the  amount  of  Jewish  tradition  that  they  actually  observe  despite  their  protestations  to  the  contrary.   Jewish  behaviourism  is  far  from   dead  on  Israeli  soil,  though  many  of   us  would  like  to  see  much  more  of  it  -  and  we  would,  if  more  Israelis  were  more  tolerant  of  the  strictly  Ortho  dox,  and  if  the  latter  had  a  warmer,  broader  attitude.   But  behaviourism  in  the  narrow  sense  is  not  the  only  criterion  of  Jew  ish  quality.   What  about  Jewish  learning?  More  Jews  are  studying  more  Torah  in  Israel  than  ever  before  in  Jewish  history,  and  we  even  hear  of  secular  ists  setting  up  their  own  yeshivot  to  delve  into  the  traditional  texts.  There  used  to  be  a  notice  in  the  central  bus   station  in  Jerusalem,  ""If  you’ve  been  to  Jerusalem  and  not  been  to  a  yeshivah,  you  haven’t  been  to  Jerusalem.”  There  are  so  many  types  of  yeshivot  in  Israel  that  it  is  the  rab  binic  saying  about  the  Torah  having  70  faces  come  true,  though  some  of  the  feces  are  still  lacking  in  the  state  education  system.   Jewish  menschlichkeit  is  alive  and  well  on  the  Israeli  scene.  Even  the  buses  say,  ""Mip’nei  sevah  takum  -  Rise  before  the  hoary  head”.  When  any  Israeli  family  is  suffering,  because  of  terrorism  or  any  other  tragedy,  every  other  Israeli  is  their  relative.  Isn’t  this  what  the  Bible  means  when  it  says,  “Immo  anochi  b’tzarah  -1  am  with  them  in  distress”  -  which  speaks  about  God  but  challenges  us  to  emu  late  Him?  Isn’t  Divine-human  chessed  the  mark  of  the  Israeli  ethos,  whether  one  carries  a  religious  label   or  not?   World  Jewry  -  and  world   I  Judaism  -  owe  more  to   the  imperfect  reality  of  Israel  than  the  Jewish  people  are  always  prepared  to  admit.   Israel  is  ""or  lagoyyim  -  a  light  unto  the  nations”  —  indirectly,  through  the  biblical  and  even  rab  binic  ethics  that  are  part  of  western  culture  (even  when  supposedly  intel  ligent  academics  forget  that  without  the  Jewish  element  their  culture  would  be  threadbare),  and  in  a  more  direct  sense,  through  Israeli  contri  butions  to  the  marketplace  of  ideas  and  inventions,  and,  when  any  nation   Slowly  but  surely,  Israel  Is  becoming  a  more  Jewish  state,  writes  Rabbi  Raymond   Apple  from  his  home  In  Jerusalem.   needs  a  helping  hand,  from  Israeli  chessed  (though  some  would  cut  off  their  nose  to  spite  their  face  rather  than  be  seen  talking  to  an  Israeli).   True,  there  is  a  dearth  of  men  and  women  of  high  principle  in  the  top  echelons  of  national  leadership.  There  is  far  too  much  self-seeking  and  corruption  and  rorting  the  sys  tem.  But  it  is  a  good  sign  that  the  Israeli  people  are  aware  of  their  lead  ers’  feet  of  clay,  critical  of  the  faults  and  failings  they  see,  and  determined  that  they  can  do  better.   Jewish  nationhood  was  an  inspir  ing  ideal  for  Rav  Kook  and  so  many  other  gedolim  (greats).  They  dreamed  of  a  Jewish  polity  with  a  messianic  quality.  They  had  prob  lems  with  political  nationalism  and  rightly  feared  that  it  would  sully  the   dream.  They  would  be  the  first  to  recognise  how  much  further  we  have  to  go.  But  they  would  also  be  the  first  to  see  that  world  Jewry  -  and  world  Judaism  -  owe  more  to  the  imperfect  reality  of  Israel  than  the  Jewish  peo  ple  are  always  prepared  to  admit.   Israel  is  demographically  a  state  of,  and  for,  Jews.  As  a  Jewish  state  it  has  its  debits,  but  its  credits  are  far  from  unimpressive.  The  unterste  shurah  -  the  bottom  line?  If  Israel  is  not  yet  a  fully  Jewish  state,  it  is  a  Jew  ish  state  in  the  making,  well  on  the  way  to  becoming  worthy  of  the   dream.

"  Jewish  group  wants  Mormons  to  stop  proxy  baptisms   ALLISON  HOFFMAN   NEW  YORK  -  Holocaust  survivors  said  on  Monday  they  were  abandoning  negotia  tions  with  the  Mormon  church  over  its  posthumous  baptisms  of  Jews  who  were  killed  in  Nazi  death  camps.   Survivors  claim  elders  of  the  Salt  Lake  City-based  Church  of  Jesus  Christ  of  Latter-Day  Saints  have  refused  to  system  ically  search  for  and  remove  the  names  of  Holocaust  victims  from  their  master  genealogical  database,  and  have  failed  to  prevent  ""zealots”  from  adding  thou  sands  of  new  Jewish  names  to  the  list  in  recent  years  -  including  thousands  lifted  from  Yizkor  books  of  Jews  massacred  at  Berdichev  in  Ukraine.   ""We  are  not  going  to  continue  meeting  with  the  Mormon  Church,”  said  Auschwitz  survivor  Ernest  Michel,  head  of  the  Amer  ican  Gathering  of  Jewish  Holocaust  Sur  vivors,  who  has  spearheaded  efforts  to  scrub  the  Mormon  lists  since  discovering  in  the  1990s  that  his  parents  were  among  380,000  Holocaust  victims  having  been  baptised  posthumously  into   the  Christian  faith.   Gary  Motokoff,  a  Jewish  genealogist  who  participated  in  meetings  with  Mormon  leaders,  described  the  negotia  tions  as  ""fruitless”.   He  and  Michel  claimed  the  church  had  failed  to  enforce  rules  it  agreed  to  in  1995  to  prevent  Holocaust  victims’  names  from  being  added  and  had  not  reprimanded  those  who  moved  to  restore  thousands  that  had  been  removed  from  baptismal  lists.   ""The  church's  actions  show  disrespect  for  us  -  they  revise  history,  intentionally  or  not,”  said  Michel,  who  cited  July  corre  spondence  with  church  leaders  at  a  Man  hattan  news  conference  in  which  elders  stated  they  would  only  remove  the  names  of  Jewish  Holocaust  victims  upon  request  rather  than  conducting  their  own  records   search.

She  said  the  church  had  failed  to  remove  all  380,000  known  Holocaust  victims'  names  after  the  1995  agreement  with  Michel's  group,  while  her  searches  of  closed  databases  revealed  many  bap  tised  Mormons  with  typically  Jewish  names,  such  as  Solomon  or  Esther,  who  had  died  between  1941  and  1945.

"  DON’T  EQUATE  JEWISH  AND   SHARI’ALAW   II  is  mischievous  and  erroneous  for   commentators  and  shari’a  law  sup  porters,  such  as  Muslim  spokesperson  Anisa  Buckley  quoted  in  the  Sunday  Herald  Sun,  to  bring  in  the  Jewish  reli  gion  to  further  their  argument  sup  porting  introducing  shari’a  law  in   UK/Australia  and  the  West.   There  are  no  overlapping  jurisdic  tions  between  Jewish  law  and  UK/Australian  law  and  Jewish  law  is  not  an  ancillary  jurisdiction  here  or  in  the  UK.  Jewish  religious  law  has  no  binding  force  in  our  countries.  Buck  ley  argued  Jews  seek  justice  through  the  beth  din  and  tried  to  compare  it  with  shari’a  law,  but  the  beth  din  tri  bunal’s  outcomes  cannot  be  enforced  over  and  above  Australian  law.

"  Are  you  smarter  than  a  (Jewish)  5th  grader?   A/A/STAFF   WHAT  is  the  source  of  the  menorah  on  the  Israeli  emblem?  Which  customs  recall  the  link  between  Jews  and  their  homeland?  What  is  the  significance  of  the  two  blue  stripes  on  the  Israeli  flag?   These  were  some  of  the  questions  suc  cessfully  answered  by  seven  bright  young  contestants  as  they  completed  the  first  stages  of  the  Mibereshit  My  Israel  Quiz,  brought  to  Australian  schools  by  the  Zionist  Federation  of  Australia  (ZFA).   The  students,  from  years  5  and  6,  came  out  on  top  of  their  respective  schools  and  will  now  participate  in  the  national  quiz  finals  in  Sydney  on  Sunday,  May  4,  as  part  of  Israel’s  60th-anniversary  celebrations.   The  ZFA  arranged  for  more  than  2000  pri  mary  school  students  from  across  Australia  and  New  Zealand  to  participate  in  the  initial  intra-school  stages.  The  students  did  most  of  the  preparation  for  the  quiz  themselves,  with  some  assistance  from  teachers,  tutors  and  parents.   “This  has  been  a  fantastic  opportunity  to   introduce  young  children  in  Jewish  schools  all  around  the  world  to  events,  personalities  and  concepts  associated  with  Israel,”  said  Sima  Guttman,  the  ZFA’s  educational  shlicha  and  consultant.  “It  was  amazing  to  see  the  students’  pride  in  the  knowledge  they  gained   about  Israel.”   The  winner  of  the  national  quiz  will  repre  sent  Australia  against  contestants  from  17  countries,  including  Israel,  in  the  interna  tional  quiz  in  Jerusalem  on  Yom  Yerushalayim.

"  NZ  PM  credits  success  to  his  Jewish  mother   ANDREW  ZIMMER   WELLINGTON  -  A  new  centre-right  gov  ernment  led  by  John  Key’s  conserva  tive  National  Party  has  taken  office  in  New  Zealand  following  the  electoral  defeat  of  Helen  Clark’s  Labour  Party  in  the  November  8  election.   The  new  47-year-old  prime  min  ister,  who  was  sworn  in  during  a  cer  emony  in  the  capital,  Wellington,  has  credited,  his  success  to  his  Jewish  mother,  an  Austrian  who  escaped  the  Nazis  in  1939  and  worked  as  a  cleaner  to  get  him  through  university.,,,   His  alcoholic  father  died  when  he   was  seven.   Key  made  a  fortune  overseas  as  a  foreign  currency  dealer,  before  returning  home  to  enter  parliament  six  years  ago.   He  has  pledged  to  continue  the  past  strong  relationship  his  country  enjoyed  with  Israel.   “Israel  is  a  country  that  I  haven’t  had  the  opportunity  to  visit,  but  one  for  which  I  definitely  have  great  respect,  especially  for  its  economic  growth  and  high-tech  strength,”  he  said  in  a  telephone  interview  with  ,  JsraeU&amp;dip*  .......  —   The  Mossad  spy  affair  should  be  “put  behind  us”,  he  said,  a  reference  to  the  diplomatic  meltdown  sparked  by  the  “passport  affair”  in  2004,  when  two  apparent  Mossad  agents  were  caught  trying  to  illegally  obtain  a  Kiwi  passport.   In  the  wake  of  this  affair,  the  then  prime  minister  suspended  high-level  relations  for  more  than  a  year,  until  Israel  apologised.

"  Marranos  discover  their  Jewish  roots  and  faith   GABS  NEWMAN  reports  a  new  phenomenon  sweeping   Portugal  as  descendants  of  Marranos  rediscover  their   Jewish  roots  and  the  Jewish  faith.   YOSEF  Pero  Philip  is  professor  of   psychiatry  at  the  University  of   Porto.  Arieh  Ben  Avraham  is  a  renowned  film  director.  Yosef   Eduardo  Albas  is  a  soccer  player  in  Portugal’s  second  division  and  accordingly  well  known  to  fans  across  Europe.  All  three  men  have  recently  converted  to  Judaism,  observe  the  mitzvot  in  accordance  with  Orthodox  tradition  and  are  distinctly  proud  of  their  rediscovered  and  intensively  studied  Jewish  heritage.   These  three  men  are  also  repre   sentative  of  a  noticeable  recent  trend   among  descendants  of  Spanish  and  Portuguese  Marranos,  that  is  Sephardic  Jews  forced  by  the  Inquisi  tion  and  its  offshoots  to  adopt  the  identity  of  Christians.  After  centimes   with  no  Jewish  connection  except  perhaps  a  blurred  family  tradition  as  to  their  ancestors,  they  are  now  redis  covering  their  Jewish  faith  and  reclaiming  their  ancient  heritage  en   masse.   Rabbi  Eliyahu  Bimbaum  of  the  Shavei  Israel  Foundation,  which  oversees  the  conversion  process  among  these  Marrano  descendants,  said  that  over  the  years  individual  Marranos  have  converted  to  Judaism,  but  now,  thanks  to  the  foundation’s  efforts,  entire  communities  of  Mar  rano  offspring,  including  one  Porto  community,  are  converting  to  Judaism  and  reclaiming  their  ancient  heritage.   “If  you  asked  people  in  Israel  -  and  for  that  matter  most  Jews  around   the  world  -  they  would  probably  tell  you  that  Marranos  are  merely  a  blurb  on  the  annals  of  history.  But  here  we  see  definitive  proof  that  people  still   view  themselves  as  Marranos  and  children  of  Marranos,  and  that  this  is  a  very  real,  spiritual  phenomenon,”   said  Rabbi  Bimbaum.   Indeed,  many  Portuguese  are  now  becoming  reacquainted  with  their  Jewish  lineage.  Aaron  Ram,  Israel’s  ambassador  to  Portugal,  said  that  “when  people  find  out  that  I’m  the  Israeli  ambassador,  many  end  up  telling  me  that  they  are  Jewish,  or  rather  that  they  are  of  Jewish  descent.  Many  of  these  Marranos  are  not  Jew  ish  anymore,  nor  do  they  intend  to  convert,  but  they  nevertheless  men  tion  their  heritage  with  great  pride.  I   would  say  that  10  per  cent  of  all  Por  tuguese  are  offspring  of  Marranos  of  Jewish  descent  ”   What  led  to  this  spiritual  reawak  ening  among  these  former  Jews?  The  waning  power  of  the  church  in  both  Spain  and  Portugal  is  a  definite  factor  leading  to  this  trend,  as  is  the  quest  for  belonging  and  identity  so  preva  lent  around  the  world  today.   The  Marrano  descendants  in   question  tend  to  come  from  a  high  socioeconomic  background,  and  are  typically  well  integrated  into  the  Christian  society  that  they  live  in.  They  claim  that  their  return  to  their  Jewish  heritage  does  not  invoke  scorn  or  hatred  in  their  peers,  and  that  they  are  typically  applauded  for  their   resolve  and  bravery.

"  France  condemns  attack  on  Jewish  teen  in  central  Paris   PARIS—Some  300  people  gathered  on  Sunday  evening  at  die  Beth  Haya  Mouchka  Lubavitch  synagogue  in  Paris’s  19th  district  to  pray  for  the  recovery  of  the  Jewish  teenager  sav  aged  on  Saturday  evening  by  a  gang  of  youths  of  Black  African  origin.   The  synagogue  is  located  near  the  place  where  17-year-old  Rudy  Haddad,  a  member  of  the  local  Lubavitch  community,  was  attacked  by  youths,  who  beat  him  with  metal  bars  and  smashed  his  skull.   The  victim,  who  suffered  several  broken  ribs  and  a  fractured  skull,  was  placed  in  intensive  care  and  was  still   in  a  coma.   The  multi-ethnic  area,  which  includes  several  synagogues,  has  been  the  stage  of  several  anti-Jewish  inci  dents  in  the  last  months,  said  Raphael  Haddad,  head  of  the  union  of  French  Jewish  students  (UEJF).   “We  were  celebrating  Shabbat.  My  son  was  wearing  his  kippah  and  was  coming  home,”  Rudy’s  father,  Philippe  Haddad,  told  KIT  radio.   “A  gang  of  about  a  dozen  youths   attacked  him  because  he  was  wearing  a  kippah  and  because  he  is  a  Jew,”  he  said.  “My  wife  and  I  are  very  upset.”   Gerard  Cachet,  a  spokesman  for  the  Interior  Ministry,  said  the  attack  was  “clearly  anti-Semitic”,  as  the  young  man  was  wearing  a  kippah  and  no  other  motivation  was  found.   “There  is  no  doubt  that  this  is  an  anti-Semitic  act,”  said  Ariel  Gold  mann,  vice-president  of  CRIF,  the  umbrella  group  of  French  Jewish  organisations.   Police  said  they  had  detained  five  youths  in  connection  with  the  beating.   On  Sunday,  French  President  Nicolas  Sarkozy  led  condemnation  of  the  attack.  Travelling  to  Israel  for  a   state  visit,  he  issued  a  statement  expressing  his  “profound  indigna  tion”  and  reaffirmed  his  “total  deter  mination  to  combat  all  forms  of  racism  and  anti-Semitism”.   A  number  of  anti-racism  organi  sations  also  suggested  it  was  a  trou  bling  act  of  anti-Semitic  violence,  and  called  on  French  authorities  to  take  action  to  combat  hate  crimes.   The  League  Against  Racism  and  anti-Semitism  recalled  the  2006  murder  of  Han  Halimi,  and  said  in  a  statement:  “It  is  high  time  to  deal  a  decisive  blow  to  the  unspeakable  vio  lence  that  Jews  suffer  in  a  recurrent  fashion  in  the  heart  of  the  capital  of  the  French  republic  ”   Halimi,  23,  was  kidnapped  by  a   gang  and  brutally  murdered  in  Feb  ruary  2006,  prompting  French  authorities  to  pledge  a  new  resolve  to  fight  anti-Semitism.   Anti-Semitism  is  a  sensitive  issue   in  France,  where  the  600,000-strong  Jewish  community  is  Western  Europe’s  largest,  and  is  also  home  to  five-million  Muslims.

"  Australian  Jewish  population  ninth  largest  in  the  world   SHARON  BERGER   WITH  104,000  Jewish  people,  Australia  accounts  for  0.8  per  cent  of  world  Jewry,  but  is  ranked  as  the  ninth  largest  Jewish  community,  behind  Germany  (120,000)  and  in  front  of  Brazil  (96,200),  according  to  recent  census  data  released  by  demographer  Dr  Gary  Eckstein.   The  extensive  report  was  commissioned  by  the  Jewish  Communal  Appeal  (JCA)  to  better  understand  the  chal   lenges  facing  the  community.  Demographic  issues  include  an  ageing  population,  inter  marriage,  slowing  emigration   from  South  Africa  and  a  reduction  in  Jewish  school  attendance  rates.  The  results   demonstrate  that  the  Sydney  Jewish  community  continued  to  see  a  marginal  increase  of  1.1  per  cent  growth  in  its  population  from  40,025  in  2001  to  42,232  in  2006.   Sydney  is  one  of  the  few  Diaspora  communities  demonstrating  statistical  growth  and  the  JCA  is  exam  ining  ways  to  further  enhance  its  population.  Last  year,  the  organisation  initiated  Project  Sydney  to  attract  potential   South  African  and  British   immigrants  to  Sydney.  South  African  immigrants  currently  account  for  19.5  per  cent  of  the  community,  compared  to  44.2  per  cent  Australian-born  Jews.   Further  growth  in  the  Jewish  day  schools  is  also  likely  to  be  determined  by  immigration,  because  cur  rently  53  per  cent  of  Jewish  families  send  their  children  to  Jewish  schools,  down  from  58  per  cent  in  2001.   The  Sydney  community  remains  highly  concentrated  in  the  eastern  suburbs  of   Sydney  (64  per  cent)  yet  only  accounts  for  8.8  per  cent  of  the  total  population.  Interest   ingly,  it  has  become  more  common  for  recent  immi   grants  from  South  Africa  to  move  directly  into  the  eastern  suburbs,  particularly  to  the  south-eastern  suburbs  (Randwick  to  Maroubra),  than  to  the  north  shore  suburbs.   Sydney  Jews  are  older  than  the  average  population,  a  legacy  of  the  major  migration  period  around  World  War  II.   A  growing  number  of  eld  erly  women  over  the  age  of  80  live  alone,  and  the  report  pre  dicted  they  will  need  increasing  support.  The  JCA  said:  “This  puts  aged-care  services,  including  home  based  support,  in  the  spot  light  going  forward.”   Intermarriage  rates  remain  stable,  at  around  one-third  of  marriages.  The  children  of  mixed  marriages  are  recorded  as  Jewish  in  about  35  per  cent  of  cases,  more  commonly  when  the  mother  is  Jewish. ",2008-05-30

"  Double  celebration  for  New  Zealand’s   Jewish  community   SHARON  BERGER   AUCKLAND  -  On  Sunday,  the  New  Zealand  Jewish  community  offi  cially  celebrated  Israel’s  60th  anniversary  in  Auckland,  including  an  emotional  ceremony  awarding  the  title  of  Righteous  among  the  Nations  to  a  former  Dutch  woman,  now  living  in  Christchurch,  who  helped  save  three  Jews  during  the   Holocaust.   Among  the  300  people  attending  the  gala  event,  which  was  organised  jointly  by  the  Embassy  of  Israel  and  the  New  Zealand  Zionist  Federa  tion,  was  former  Australian  foreign  minister  Alexander  Downer,  New  Zealand  Opposition  Leader  John  Key,  and  15  members  of  parliament,  including  Shane  Jones  and  Winnie   Laban.   All  of  the  speakers  and  the  audi  ence  were  touched  by  the  presenta  tion  to  Hermina  van  der  Schaaf   who,  along  with  her  late  husband,  was  honoured  for  her  bravery  in  hiding  three  Jews  in  Holland  during  World  War  II.  The  Pollack  family  stayed  with  them  for  two  months  during  1943  until  a  safe  place  was  found  for  them.  In  his  testimony  to  the  couple,  one  of  the  survivors,  Max  Pollack,  detailed  all  that  the  van  der  Schaafs  did  for  his  family,  at   the  risk  of  their  own  lives.   After,  receiving  the  award  from  Ambassador  Rotem,  Laban  and  Robert  Narev  (also  a  Holocaust  sur  vivor),  Van  der  Schaaf  said  that  she  had  done  nothing  extraordinary.   Narev’s  wife  was  saved  during  the  Holocaust  by  a  Catholic  nun,  who  could  not  be  located  after  the  war.  He  said  that  presenting  van  der  Schaaf  with  the  prestigious  award  from  Israel’s  Holocaust  museum,  Yad  Vashem,  was  like  closing  the  circle  for  his  family.

"  Obama,  Clinton  in  dead  heat  among  Jewish  Democrats   RON  SCAM  PEAS   WASHINGTON  DC  —  Even  as  conserva  tives  continue  to  paint  Barack  Obama  as  being  surrounded  by  anti-Israel  advisers,  a  new  poll  shows  the  Illinois  senator  and  Hillary  Rodham  Clinton  in  a  neck-and-neck  battle  for  Jewish  support.   A  March  Gallup  Poll  found  Jewish  Democrats  in  a  statistical  dead  heat  in   their  support  for  their  party’s  presi   dential  nominees.   Clinton,  a  New  York  senator,  led  Obama  by  48  per  cent  to  43  per  cent  —  a  differential  falling  within  the  six  per  cent  margin  of  error  for  the  Jews   interviewed.   The  results  reflect  the  dead  heat   found  among  voters  in  general  in  a   separate  national  Gallup  Poll  released  on  Monday.   The  poll  comes  after  months  of  aggressive  efforts  by  Obama  and  his  campaign  staff  to  repel  ongoing  email  attacks  painting  him  as  unsupportive  of  Israel,  amid  speculation  that  he  was  in  danger  of  losing  Jewish   support.   Over  the  past  week,  conservative  websites  revealed  and  played  up  the  feet  that  Obama’s  pastor  reprinted  a  Los  Angeles  Times  opinion  piece  chal  lenging  Israel’s  right  to  exist,  and  pointed  to  a  2003  interview  in  which  one  of  his  top  advisers  appeared  to  blame  the  pro-Israel  lobby  for  failures  in  the  Middle  East  peace  process.   Citing  these  sorts  of  attacks  in  its  news  release  on  the  survey,  Gallup   seemed  surprised  by  the  close  margin  among  Jewish  voters.  But  some  Democratic  observers  familiar  with   the  Jewish  community  said  the  tight   battle  should  not  come  as  a  shock.   Mark  Mellman,  a  top  Democratic  pollster,  noted  that  the  Jewish  com  munity  is  rich  in  two  constituencies  that  are  considered  natural  redoubts  for  each  of  the  candidates.   “White  women  favor  Clinton  and  college-educated  white  men  favor  Obama,”  said  Mellman,  who  has  not  declared  for  either  candidate.   National  Jewish  Democratic  Council  executive  director  Ira  Forman  agreed,  noting  that  Clinton  also  was  likelier  to  draw  older  voters.

"  Jewish  groups  threaten  legal  action  against  Le  Pen   PARIS  -  French  Anti-racism  and   Jewish  groups  threatened  immediate  legal  action  against  Jean-Marie  Le  Pen,  the  National  Front  leader,  after  he  repeated  previous  incendiary  com  ments  that  the  Nazi  gas  chambers  were  a  “detail  of  history5’.   “I  said  the  gas  chambers  were  a  detail  of  the  history  of  World  War  II:  that,  to  me,  seems  so  obvious,”  the  79-year-old  Le  Pen  said  in  an  interview  with  Bretons,  a  regional  magazine,  published  on  Friday.   Le  Pen  was  already  fined  1.2  million  francs  ($US290,000)  for  making  the  initial  remarks  in  an   interview  on  RTL  radio  in  1987.   When  the  Bretons  journalist  told  him  that  the  Nazis  “deported  people  to  camps  simply  to  kill  them”,  Le  Pen  replied:  “But  that  is  what  you  believe.  I  don’t  feel  obliged  to  adhere  to  that   view.”   CRIF,  the  umbrella  representative  group  of  French  Jewish  institutions,   said  in  a  statement  that  it  was   “disgusted”  by  the  comments,  and  accused  Le  Pen,  whose  political  fortunes  have  recently  slumped,  of  “going  even  further  down  the  road  of   revisionism  ...  to  draw  attention  to  himself’.   SOS  Racism  called  Le  Pen’s   remarks  “a  pitiful  attempt  to  keep  himself  in  the  media  eye”,  while  the  French  Jewish  Student  Union  said  it  was  taking  legal  action  against  him.  The  International  League  Against   Racism  and  Anti-Semitism  said  it   planned  to  file  legal  action  against  Le  Pen  after  consulting  its  lawyers.   Convicted  several  times  for  anti-Semitic  and  racist  comments  on   World  War  II  history,  Le  Pen  was  handed  a  three-month  suspended  jail  sentence  in  February  for  describing  the  Nazi  occupation  of  France  as  “not  especially  inhumane”.

But  the  country’s  Centraal  Joods  Overleg  (Central  Jewish  Platform)  drew  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  15  minute  film,  entitled  Fitna,  a  Koranic  term  meaning  “strife”,  shows  Muslim  clerics  calling  to  behead  Jews,  quotes  Koran  passages  equating  Jews  to  “pigs  and  monkeys”  and  includes  photos  of  demonstrators  promising  “another  Holocaust”  and  praising  Adolf  Hitler.   The  film,  which  shows  footage  of  the  September  11  terrorist  attacks  fol  lowed  by  the  Madrid  train  bombings,  was  posted  on  the  internet  last  week.   Wilders,  leader  of  the  Party  for  Freedom,  which  holds  nine  of  the  Dutch  parliament’s  150  seats,  said  he  wants  to  show  that  the  Koran  “is  an  inspiration  for  intolerance,  murder   and  terror”.   The  Dutch  Jewish  body  said  Wilders’  film  “was  guilty  of  serious  generalisations”.   “Only  the  negative  elements  of  the  Koran  are  shown,”  it  said,  adding:  “By  presenting  graphics  on  the  explosive  increase  of  the  Muslim  population  in   Holland  and  Europe  in  relation  with  pictures  of  terrorist  attacks  and  with  the  slogan,  ‘Stop  Islamisation,  protect  our  freedom,’  Wilders  suggests  that  all  Muslims  are  potential  terrorists.”   While  the  anti-Jewish  statements  that  Wilders  compiled  demonstrate  “some  Muslim  clerics  have  dreadful  ideas  about  Jews  and  that  even  chil  dren  are  being  brainwashed”,  the  film  only  serves  to  “polarise  Dutch  society  and  is  counterproductive  to  the  fight  against  extremism”,  the  Jewish  body   said.   The  Central  Jewish  Platform  said  it  wants  to  work  with  the  Muslims  in   Holland  and  the  rest  of  the  country  in   order  to  halt  extremism  and  radicali  sation.   Dutch  Prime  Minister  Jan  Peter  Balkenende,  who  was  worried  about  possible  repercussions  for  Dutch  citi  zens  and  economic  interests,  said  he  was  “proud”  of  Dutch  Muslims  for  their  peaceful  reaction  to  the  film.   Dutch  Socialist  newspaper  De  Vdkskrant  stated  that  if  Wilders  had  said  the  same  things  about  Jews  that  he  has  said  about  Muslims,  “he  would  have  been  prosecuted  for  anti   Semitism”   EUROPEAN  JEWISH  PRESS ",2008-04-04
"  Iran  emerges  as  wedge  issue  for  Jewish  voters   NATHAN  GUTTMAN   DENVER  -  As  Democrats  work  to  shore  up  support  from  Jewish  voters,  and  Republicans  do  all  they  can  to  tear  it  down,  Iran  is  emerging  as  a  piv  otal  foreign  policy  issue  in  the  presi  dential  campaign,  and  an  indirect  test  by  many  Jews  of  the  candidates’  full  commitment  to  Israel’s  security.   Senator  Barack  Obama’s  cam   paign  has  been  struggling  to  clarify  its  policy  toward  Iran  and  to  elaborate  on  Obama’s  call  for  engaging  in  nego   tiations  with  the  government  in  Tehran.  Seeking  to  drive  a  wedge  between  the  Illinois  Democrat  and  the  Jewish  community,  GOP  Senator  John  McCain  unveiled  a  new  television  ad  asserting  that  Obama  does  not  grasp  the  danger  Iran  poses  to  Israel  -  a  point  that  the  Obama  campaign  vigorously  disputes.   -  At  a  campaign  stop  on  August  25,  Obama  said  his  job  as  president  will  be  “tightening  the  screws  diplomatically  on  Iran”,  and  getting  sanctions  in  place  as  soon  as  possible.   “We’ve  got  to  do  that  before  Israel  feels  like  its  back  is  to  the  wall,”  the  candidate  said.   Campaign  officials  insisted  that  Obama’s  tough  rhetoric  on  Iran  represents  not  a  shift  in  attitude,  but  a  broader  presentation  of  his  approach.  They  say  Obama  views  a  parallel-track  approach  toward  Iran,  in  which  engagement,  sanctions  and  divestment  are  used  together  to  per  suade  the  government  in  Tehran  to  change  its  policy,  before  moving  to  tougher  actions.   Meantime,  a  new  McCain  ad  quotes  phrases  from  Obama’s  May  18  campaign  speech  in  Oregon,  where  he  said  Iran  “doesn’t  pose  a  serious  threat”.  As  pictures  go  from  Iranian  leader  Mahmoud   Ahmadinejad  to  armed  soldiers,  and  finally  to  a  bird’s-eye  view  of  Jerusalem,  the  narrator  asks:  “Ter  rorism?  Destroying  Israel?  Those  aren’t  serious  threats?”,  and  then  concludes:  “Obama.  Dangerously  unprepared  to  be  president”   THE  FORWARD ",2008-09-05
"  Needless  hatred  and  Jewish  unity   TORAH  TOPIC   RABBI  IMMANUEL  BERNSTEIN   ש  ואתחנן  ברומו   Parshat  Vaetchanan  continues  Moshe  Rabbenu’s  summary  of  the  40  years  spent  in  the  desert.  Highlights  are  the   10  Commandments  and  the  Shema.  However,  the  Shabbat  takes  its  name  from  the  Haftarah  (Isaiah  40),  which  with  a  post-Tisha  b’Av  theme  begins  with  the  words  “Nachamu,  nachamu  ami  -  Console,  console  my  people”   11  N  a  well-known  passage,  the  Tal  11  mud  (Yoma  9b)  compares  the  y  respective  causes  for  the  destruc  tion  of  the  First  and  Second  Temples.   The  first  was  destroyed  as  a  result  of  the  transgressions  in  the  areas  of  idol  atry,  bloodshed  and  physical  immorality,  the  three  most  severe  sins  in  the  Torah.  The  second,  however,  was  destroyed  because  sin’at  chinam  -  needless  hatred  -  was  prevalent  among  our  people.  The  Talmud  con   cludes  that  from  here  we  see  that  needless  hatred  is  equivalent  in  grav  ity  to  the  three  cardinal  sins.  How  are  we  to  understand  this  equation?   Rabbi  Avraham  Gurwitz,  rosh   yeshivah  of  Gateshead,  provides  a  most  stimulating  answer.  With  regards  to  the  first  prototype  of  the  temple,  the  tabernacle  in  the  wilder   ness,  the  Torah  states:  “Ve’asu  li  mik  dash  veshachanti  betocham  -  and   they  shall  make  for  me  a  sanctuary,   and  I  will  dwell  in  their  midst”.  The  Midrash  comments  that  the  Torah   does  not  say  I  will  dwell  “be’tocho  -  in  its  midst”,  but  rather  “betocham  -  in  their  midst”.  Through  the  medium  of  the  mishkan,  God  will  cause  His  Pres  ence  to  reside  among  us.  How  does  making  the  mishkan  bring  this  about?   We  would  perhaps  be  inclined  to  say  that  the  presence  of  the  mishkan  is  a  setting  for  each  and  every  person  to  come  and  be  inspired  to  raise  their  level  of  holiness,  until  they  are  deserv  ing  of  hosting  the  divine  presence.  This  is  undoubtedly  true,  but  there  is   another  element.   1  What  unifies  us  is  our   I  focus  on  the  centrality  of  (1  the  values  and  teachings  I  of  the  Torah.   When  Jews  pray,  wherever  in  the  world  they  may  be,  they  all  face  towards  the  same  direction  -  the  tem  ple  site.  The  Vilna  Gaon  (Shir  Hashirim,  1:17)  explains  that  this  practice  epitomises  a  key  function  of  the  mikdash,  namely,  that  through  the  entire‘Jewish  people  facing  inwards  towards  the  same,  they  are  thus  uni  fied  on  a  national  level  -  a  unity  which  makes  them  worthy  of  housing  the  divine  presence.  The  Gaon  further   discerned  this  concept  in  the  very  con  struction  of  the  mishkan.  The  Torah  mandated  that  it  be  the  result  of  con   tributions  from  every  single  Jew,  for  the  joint  investment  and  involvement  in  this  holy  venture  provided  a  most  powerful  basis  for  the  unification  of  our  people.   With  this  appreciation  of  the  role  of  the  mishkan  in  mind,  we  can  well  understand  how  sin’at  chinam   brought  about  its  destruction;  for  while  it  may  not  at  first  glance  appear  as  severe  as  the  three  cardinal  sins,  its  nature  erodes  the  very  fabric  that  the  mikdash  is  meant  to  promote,  and  indeed  is  a  violation  of  its  very  essence.   May  we  observe  in  conclusion  that  this  powerful  insight  of  the  Vilna  Gaon  is  the  basis  not  only  for  enhanced  appreciation  of  the  value  of  Jewish  unity,  but  also  provides  direction  for  its  meaningful  implementation;  for  we   see  that  the  Torah’s  model  for  what  unifies  us  is  our  focus  on  the  temple  in  our  midst,  namely,  a  focus  on  the  cen  trality  of  the  values  and  teachings  of  the  Torah.  And  it  is  our  hope  that  as  we  maintain  and  promote  these  values  in  the  centre  of  our  lives,  so  may  we  find  unity  with  one  another  and  may  the  Almighty  restore  the  temple  in  our  midst  as  the  crown  of  the  redemption  for  which  we  have  been  waiting.   Rabbi  Immanuel  Bernstein,  rosh  yeshivah  of  Machon  Yaakov  Jerusalem,  is  currently   visiting  Melbourne. ",2008-08-15
"  WORLD  NEWS  OF  THE  WORLD   UTTER  BASTARD  STILL  RICH   In  spite  of  the  ongoing  financial  crisis,  an  utter  bastard  is  still  quite  rich.  We  met  him  in  his  plush  inner  city  apartment,  wearing  his  usual  self-satisfied  smile  that  tells  everyone  he  meets  how  much  better  than  them  he  is.  He  explained  in  great  detail  how  rich  he  still  is  and  how  little  the  market  collapse  has  affected  his  wealth.  Rather  than  showing  humility,  he  seemed  to  have  become  even  more  smug  and  insufferable  in  the  face  of  the  world's,  financial  difficulties.  Having  retained  most  of  his  wealth,  the  fact  that  he  had  sufficient  resources  and  market  know  how  to  weather  such  a  storm  made  him  feel  smugger  than  ever  about  his  own  superiority.  ""Thank  God  I  was  smart  enough  to  invest  wisely!""  he  said,  in  a  way  that  made  people  want  to  break  his  nose.  •   Racist  unsure  who  to  support  in  ongoing  Arab-Israeli  conflict.  Mark  Damian,  racist  and  bigot,  has  always  shown  a  keen  interest  in  international  affairs.  However,  the  latest  outbreak  of  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  has  left  him  lost  for  words  as  both  sides  represent  things  he  hates  and  opposes.  ""On  the  one  hand,  you  have  a  horde  of  Muslims  launching  bombs  because  they  believe  in  a  false  prophet.  They  are  evil  and  a  threat  to  all  good  white  Christians  everywhere.""  On  the  other  hand,  the  Jewish  state  is  also  anathema  to  Mark.  ""There's  already  a  cabal  of  Jews  controlling  the  banking  industry.  But  now  they've  got  a  home  base  from  which  to  destroy  us  through  interbreeding,  multiculturalism  and  manipulation  of  the  international  economy.  These  people  are  evil  and  a  threat  to  all  good  white  Christians  everywhere.""  This  dilemma  has  Mark  stumped.  ""It's  very  difficult,""  he  sighed.  ""Maybe  they'll  descend  into  a  mutually  destructive  cycle  of  violence,  retaliation  and  death  -  that  seems  to  be  working  pretty  well  so  far.""

WORLD  NEWS  OF  THE  WORLD   GAY  MAN:  QUITE  WELL  ADJUSTED    On  Thomas  Alderson's  twentieth  birthday,  the  North  Sydney  student  came  to  terms  with  something  he  had  known  in  his  heart  for  all  his  life.    He  was  gay.    Upon  acknowledging  this  life-changing  truth  about  his  identity,  Thomas  decided  to  go  down  the  road  to  the  24  hour  McDonalds  for  a  late  dinner.  As  the  student  of  Commerce  and  Law  explained:  ""Normally  I  get  a  Happy  Meal  but  it  seemed  kind  of  like  a  special  day  so  I  got  a  fillet'o'fish  instead.""  When  Thomas  shared  the  news  with  his  family  the  reaction  was  neither  positive  nor  negative.    When  contacted  by  Tharunka  his  mother,  Helene  Alderson,  said:  ""  He's  a  pretty  good  boy.    It  doesn't  really  matter  to  us  whether  he's  gay  or  straight,  just  as  long  as  he  finishes  his  degree.""  His  father,  Steven,  concurred:  ""Tom's  sexuality  is  quite...hmm,  yes.    Has  anyone  taken  int  he  washing?""  After  a  short  poriod  of  confusion  and  personal  agitation,  Thomas  found  that  his  life  looked  very  much  the  same  as  it  had  been  before.    He  continued  to  work,  study  and  relax  with  friends,  often  frequenting  the  local  establishment  and  sometimes  visiting  a  more  upmarket  bar  int  he  city  when  he  had  the  cash.  A  few  colleagues  at  his  part  time  job  in  a  Mosman  cafe'  may  have  displayed  some  latent  homophobia.    However  it  was  hard  to  tell  as  they  had  never  really  been  friends  anyway.  As  Thomas  observes:  ""  They  just  kind  of  grunted  when  I  told  them.    We  didn't  really  hang  out  before,  and  we  didn't  really  hang  out  afterwards  either.    So  I  don't  really  know  if  there  was  a  difference  or  not.""  Towards  the  end  of  our  interview  Thomas  became  visibly  impatient,  fidgeting  and  casting  frequent  glances  in  the  direction  of  his  watch.  He  attributed  this  state  if  mind  to  the  fact  that  he  had  promised  to  go  to  the  beach  with  his  housemate,  Andrew,  who  joined  us  towards  the  end  of  our  discussion.  When  asked  whether  his  relationship  with  Thomas  had  been  altered,  Andrew  gave  the  matter  some  consideration  before  replying  ""Um,  not  really.  Hey  do  you  know  if  we're  gonna  be  in  time  for  the  bus?""  Said  Thomas:  ""Let's  get  lunch  first.""    Youse  imigrants  need  to  speak  english!!!!    It  makes  me  real  mad  when  I  here  people  talking  foreign  languages  on  the  bus  and  in  in  the  streets  ur  in  Australia  speak  english  so  we  can  all  understand  you.    I'm  not  racist  or  nothin  but,  id  say  its  very  easy  to  learn  to  to  speak  english  I  mean  I  learned  it  as  a  baby,  so  imigrants  should  learn  it  so  they  don't  have  to  use  they're  wog  languages  in  Australia.    BIG  PACKAGE  STIMULATES  eager  Australian  economy    After  a  long  period  of  teasing  and  building  tension,  the  Australian  parliament  finally  gave  it  up  yesterday,  much  to  the  relief  and  excitement  of  an  Australian  public  begging  for  deep  and  long-lasting  stimulus.  The  much  need  stimulation  comes  after  a  period  of  sluggish  and  limp  activity,  during  which  the  economy  found  itself  too  busy,  stressed  or  sick  to  be  fully  excited.    This  package  is  expected  to  be  big  and  impressive  enough  that  Australia  will  become  aroused  to  new  heights  of  economic  activity.    Business  heads  are  swollen  with  excitement  at  th  prospect  of  getting  the  package  into  their  hands,  anticipating  that  it  will  supply  sufficient  fluidity  to  lubricate  the  wheels  of  industry.  Indeed,  experts  are  hoping    that  the  package  will  have  enough  strength  to  deliver  the  goods  and  reach  deep  enough  to  satisfy  everyone's  needs.    The  package  will  focus  particularly  on  targeting  vulnerable  areas,  activating  these  sensitive  spots  and  using  multiplier  effect  to  increase  the  amount  of  stimulation  reaching  through  parts  of  the  nation.  However,  given  the  demanding  task  at  hand,  advisors  have  warned  parliament  against  shooting  it's  load  prematurely.    They  say  that  it  will  need  to  be  flexible  in  its  approach  if  it  hopes  for  the  package  to  penetrate  everywhere  it  is  needed,  and  that  stamina  will  be  important  if  this  stimulus  is  going  to  get  the  economy  up  and  keep  it  up  for  as  long  as  necessary. &lt;p&gt; ",2009-03-06
