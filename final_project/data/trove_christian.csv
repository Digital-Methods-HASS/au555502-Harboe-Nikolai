"  Christian  tourists   TOURISTS  in  Israel  these  days  are  more  likely  to  be  clasping  a  copy  of  the  New  Testament  them  the  Tanach  as  they  make  their  way  from  one  religious  icon  to  another.   The  Jewish  Advocate  reports  that  more  American  Christians  now  visit  Israel  than  American   Jews.  Among  the  600,000-700,000  North  Americans  touring  Israel  each  year,  only  about  45  percent  are  Jewish—a  very  different  world   from  pre-1967  Israel,  when  75  per   cent  of  Israel’s  tourists  were  Jewish.   Israel  Government  Tourist  Office  North  America  official  Yehuda  Shen  says  the  low  number  of  American  Jews  who  had  visited  Israel  —  only  17-20  percent  —  may  stem  from  the  increasing  disen  gagement  between  American  Jews   and  Israeli  affairs.  What  has  remained  constant  is  the  religious,  historical  and  spiritual  appeal  that  draws  Gentiles  to  Israel,  he  says.  “These  tourists  comprise  the  evan  gelical  movements  coming  to  fol  low  in  the  footsteps  of  history.” ",2000-09-29

"  Late  Shirley  Christian   The  following  is  the  report  of  Mrs  Shirley  Christian  of  Bamaga.  Its  significance  is  very  important  not  only  to  the  Torres  Strait  but  the  Baha'i  Communities  throughout  the  world.  She  represented  the  Baha'is  of  Australia  in  Holy  Land,  Haifa,  Israel  in  1992  which  was  the  Baha'i  Holy  Year.  The  first  Baha'i  Funeral  in  the  Torres  Strait  was  that  of  our  devoted  and  beloved  Mrs  Shirley  MaryannChristian.  She  passed  away  peacefully  in  her  sleep  in  the  early  hours  of  Monday  21  st  of  February  2000.  Her  funeral  took  place  on  Wednesday  23  rd  February.  It  was  a  funeral  the  like  of  which  Torres  Strait  had  never  witnessed  before.  The  representative  of  the  Local  Spiritual  Assembly  of  the  Baha'is  of  Thursday  Island,  Mr  John  Spottiswoode  recited  the  Prayer  for  the  Dead.  Later  during  the  chanting  of  prayers  and  reciting  of  the  Holy  Words  of  God,  the  coffin  containing  her  bodily  remains  was  gently  lowered  into  the  bosum  of  mother  earth.  Her  resting  place  was  finally  covered  with  fresh  flowers  -  mainly  roses.  Her  favourite  flower  was  the  rose.  The  greatest  tribute  dear  Shirley  received  is  encapsulated  in  Baha'u'llah's  Holy  Word  describing  the  condition  of  a  devoted  soul.  It  is  as  follows  :   ""Seized  with  transports  of  joy,  and  raising  high  her  voice,  she  thus  exclaimed:  'May  my  life  be  a  sacrifice  to  Thee,  inasmuch  as  Thou  hast  fixed  Thy  gaze  upon  me,  hast  bestowed  upon  me  Thy  bounty,  and  hast  directed  towards  me  Thy  steps.  Separation  from  Thee,  O  Thou  Source  of  everlasting  life,  hath  well  nigh  consumed  me,  and  my  remoteness  from  Thy  presence  hath  burned  away  my  soul.  All  praise  be  to  Thee  for  having  enabled  me  to  hearken  to  Thy  call,  for  having  honored  me  with  Thy  footsteps,  and  for  having  quickened  my  soul  through  the  vitalizing  fra  grance  of  Thy  Day  and  the  shrilling  voice  of  Thy  Pen,  a  voice  Thou  didst  ordain  as  Thy  trumpet-call  amidst  Thy  people'.""  For  our  noble,  our  kind,  our  loving  Aunty  Shirley  :  ""When  the  swords  flash,  go  forward!  When  the  shafts  fly,  press  onward!  O  Thou  Sacrifice  of  the  worlds.  Dost  Thou  wail,  or  shall  I  wail?  Rather  shall  I  weep  at  the  fewness  of  Thy  champions,  O  Thou  Who  hast  caused  the  wailing  of  the  worlds"".  -  Baha'u'llah  Loved  always,  our  Aunty  Shirley,  the  friend,  the  mother,  the  rock,  the  champion.  From  her  admirers  and  well  wishers  throughout  the  world.   Contributed  by  the  Baha  'i  Community ",2000-03-03

"  Love  that  satisfies   A  story  is  told  about  a  little  boy  who  was  given  two  separate  dollar  coins  by  his  mother  to  take  to  Sunday  School,  one  to  put  in  the  collection  and  the  other  to  buy  some  sweets  on  his  way  home.  Skipping  along  the  road  he  tripped  and  dropped  the  coins.  One  rolled  down  a  nearby  drain.  The  boy  looked  up  to  heaven  and  said,  ""Sorry  God,  there  goes  your  dollar"".  Hosea  6:4b  says,  ""Your  love  is  like  a  morning  mist,  like  the  early  dew  of  the  morning"".  Our  love  for  God,  like  the  boy  in  the  story,  is  often  fleeting  and  selfish.  We  think  if  we  come  to  God  and  say  ""I'm  sony,""  everything  will  be  all  right.  Won't  it?  This  kind  of  attitude  makes  God  shake  His  head  in  frustration.  We  tend  to  think  that  all  God  wants  is  some  sort  of  superficial  turning  to  Him.  If  we  come  to  God  like  the  people  in  Hosea's  time  and  say,   ""Please""  the  Lord  will  be  delighted  and  He'll  fall  all  over  us  to  do  us  good.  But  God  isn't  interested  in  superficial  religion.  He  wasn't  in  the  time  of  Hosea  and  He  isn't  today.  That's  why  he  said,  ""Your  love  is  like  a  morning  mist"",  and  ""I  desire  mercy  not  sacrifice"".  What  do  these  two  phrases  mean?  First,  that  God  isn't  interested  in  fleeting  emotions  we  may  feel  toward  Him.  He  wants  complete  commitment.  Second,  our  love  for  God  is  not  to  be  shown  in  the  religious  ceremonies  but  in  our  daily  life.  Flowers  are  nice.  But  real  love  is  better  shown  by  helping  with  the  .dishes,  changing  dirty  nappies,  and  ""being  there""  when  support  and  encouragement  are  needed.   God  isn't  satisfied  with  a  bouquet  tossed  His  way  on  Sunday.  He  wants  us  to  show  our  love  for  Him  daily  by  doing  His  will.  And  so  God  seems  to  shake  His  head  —  and  in  frustration  wonder  aloud,  '  'What  can  I  do  with  you?''  God  has  no  use  for  ""love""  that  is  as  fleeting  and  insubstantial  as  a  morning  mist.  In  Mark  chapter  12,  verse  30,  Jesus  tells  us  exactly  what  God  requires  of  us.  He  said,  ""Love  the  Lord  your  God  with  all  your  heart  and  with  all  your  soul  and  with  all  your  mind  and  all  your  strength"".  May  you  find  God's  love  and  peace  for  you  today.   Pastor  John  Holloway  Echuca  Baptist  Church ",2000-07-21
"  Israelis  limited  in  Christian  icsiewledge   A  POLL  has  shown  that  less  than  a  third  of  Israelis  know  that  December  25  is  Christmas,  while  some  consid  er  Jesus  suitable  for  a  Knesset  job.   The  International  Fellowship  of  Christians  and  Jews  commissioned  Gallup  poll,  asked  479  Israeli  Jews  from  a  geographical  and  religious   cross-section  of  the  country,  16  questions  about  their  knowledge  and  experience  of  Christians  and   Christian  themes.   When  asked  what  Jesus’  path  might  be  were  he  alive  today,  19.6  percent  of  Israelis  surveyed  said  “Christian  preacher”,  while  fewer  than  half  that  number  said  “rabbi”.  Jesus  might  have  even  translated  his  message  into  legislation  since  4.6  percent  of  the  survey  sample  said  he  would  be  a  member  of  Knesset   today.   JTA ",2000-01-14
"  Jewish  leaders   “Christian  values”   Bernard  Rreedsnan   JEWISH  community  leaders  have  chal  lenged  the  right  of  church  organisations  acting  as  federal  job  agencies  to  ignore  anti-discrimination  laws  and  say  they  will  employ  only  those  people  with  “Christian   values”.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  acting  president  Jo  Gostin  said  that  “the  ECAJ  will  definitely  write  to  the  govern  ment  seeking  clarification  about  what  the  parameters  will  be  in  the  employment   process.   “If  there  are  going  to  be  guidelines  estab  lished  by  these  organisations  and  they  are  specific  on  Christian  values  we  will  protest  very  definitely.”   Jewish  community  concern  follows  recent  published  comments  from  Wesley  Mission  public  relations  manager  David  McGovern,  which  Sydney  solicitor  and  Woollahra  Labor  councillor  George  Newhouse  condemned  as  “offensive  and  bigoted”  and  the  sort  of  argument  “you  would  expect  to  hear  from  a  white   supremacist”.   In  an  article  published  in  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald  this  month,  Mr  McGovern  said  organisations  like  the  Wesley  Mission  had  long  maintained  a  policy  of  having  “Christian  belief”  as  an  occupational  requirement.  This  was  because  they  had  found  that  “Christians  make  the  best  staff”,  would  “do  their  job  better”,  were  not  moti  vated  solely  by  money  and  were  “often  will  ing  to  go  that  extra  mile”.   Continued  page  4   George  Newhouse   Jewish  leaders  challenge  “Christian  values”   Continued  from  page  3   Employment  Services  Minister  Tony  Abbott  subsequently  inflamed  the  controversy  when  he  defended  the  right  of  church  organisations  to  “uphold  their  own  ethos”  by  employ  ing  people  holding  Christian  beliefs.   The  Wesley  Mission  is  one  of  at  least  four  major  Christian  organisa  tions  to  have  won  contracts  poten  tially  worth  a  total  of  $1.5  billion  as  job  placement  agencies  under  the  federal  government’s  privatised  Job  Network  program.   The  Christian  agencies  —  Salvation  Army  Employment  Plus,  Mission  Australia,  Centacare  Australia  Ltd  and  Wesley  Uniting  Employment—are  among  the  top  20  successful  tenderers  for  Job  Network  agencies.  The  Salvation  Army  and  Mission  Australia  head  the  list,  each  with  potential  incomes  running  into   hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.   Victorian  Supreme  Court  Justice  Howard  Nathan:  “This  proposal  invites  almost  certain  constitutional  challenge.  Separation  of  church  and  state  is  one  of  the  constitutional  prin  ciples  we  imported  from  the  United  States  and  they,  in  turn,  imported  as  a  product  of  the  Enlightenment.   “This  is  a  principle  we  should  be  vigilant  in  upholding  and  Section  116  of  our  Constitution,  although  not  as  direct  as  its  American  parent,  does   prohibit  religious  tests  for  the  hold  ing  of  public  office.   “Where  the  government  authoris  es  religious  bodies  to  operate  some  of  its  functions,  it  cannot  permit  the  carrying  out  of  these  functions  to  be  proscribed  by  religious  belief  or  lack  of  it.  Preservation  of  public  harmony  suggests  it  would  be  best  either  to  abandon  the  proposal  or  for  the  organisations  to  expand  the  cate  gories  of  people  they  intend  to  employ.”   New  South  Wales  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  acting  president  Amanda  Gordon:  “Christians  don’t  have  a  stranglehold  on  the  values  that  make  the  best  employers  or  employees.  Arguments  that  Christians  make  the  best  employees  are  ingredients  that  can  lead  to  bigotry  and  hatred.   “I  don’t  argue  against  the  rights  of  Christian  organisations  to  employ  Christians  in  church  work  or  other  religious  activities.  They  are  perfect  ly  entitled  to  do  so  just  as  Jewish  organisations  employ  Jews  in  activi  ties  connected  with  their  faith.  If  the  churches  can  act  in  a  secular  man  ner,  well  and  good.  But  if  they  see  the  jobs  placement  program  as  part  of  their  religious  ministry,  then  the  gov  ernment  should  not  be  giving  them   funds.   “There  should  be  no  discrimina  tion  on  religious  grounds  in  the  way  they  select  staff  otherwise  non   Christians  are  not  going  to  get  a  look   in.   “It  will  be  vital  to  monitor  the  situ  ation  and  politicians  should  be  receptive  to  the  views  of  their  elec  torate  on  this  issue.  There  is  a  need  for  a  change  in  the  law  to  ensure  that  the  freedom  from  anti-discrimination  legislation  enjoyed  by  religious  organisations  does  not  extend  to  their  role  as  employers  in  job  place   ment.""   Meanwhile,  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunities  Commissioner  Chris  Sidoti  backed  Labor  and  the  Australian  Democrats  who  want  leg  islation  to  outlaw  discrimination  by  employment  agencies  run  by  reli  gious  organisations.   At  present,  the  federal  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunity  Commission  Act  allows  religious  organisations  to  discriminate  “to  avoid  injury  to  the  religious  suscepti  bilities  of  adherents”  of  a  religion  or   creed.   And  a  warning  tetter  has  reported  ly  been  sent  from  the  Employment,  Workplace  Relations  and  Small  Business  Department  to  Job  Network  agencies  reminding  them  that  clause  13  of  their  contracts  requires  them  to  provide  Job  Network  services  “with  out  any  unlawful  discrimination”.   ■  Seepage  11 ",2000-01-21
"  ?   Confess  and  be  forgiven   A  minister  out  walking  noticed  a  small  boy  trying  to  reach  a  doorbell  and  said:  ""Lei  me  help  you  sonny.""  The  minister  gave  the  doorbell  a  good  ring.  The  boy  looked  at  him  and  said.  ""Now.  you  better  run  like  mad.""  Before  he  could  think  or  run,  the  door  opened.  Imagine  the  minister  Irying  to  explain  that  one!  I  suppose  it's  all  right  to  be  angry  when  people  turn  us  into  victims.  God  understands  that  rush  of  adrenalin,  the  flushed  face,  and  the  sudden  feeling  of  fury.  But  no  anger,  even  justified  anger,  gives  us  the  right  to  strike  back.  ""Don't  get  mad,""  the  world  says.  ""Get  even.""  ""Don't  judge  or  you  will  be  judged,""  Jesus  said  in  Matthew  chapter  7  and  verse  3.  ""Why  do  you  look  after  the  speck  of  sawdust  in  your  brother's  eye  and  pay  no  attention  to  the  plank  in  your  own  eye?""  We  all  have  a  problem  with  sin  in  our  lives.  There  is  an  answer  in  the  Bible  to  this  problem  of  sin.  In  John  1:8  and  9  it  says,  ""If  we  claim  to  be  without  sin,  we  deceive  ourselves  and  the  truth  is  not  in  us.  If  we  confess  our  sins  He  is  faithful  and  just  and  will  forgive  us  our  sins  and  purify  us  from  all  unrighteousness.""  Not  only  are  we  forgiven  but  we  don't  have  to  feel  guilty  any  more!  Psalm  103:12  tells  us,  ""As  far  as  the  east  is  from  the  west,  so  far  has  He  removed  our  sins  from  Jesus  forgives  us  and  wants  to  come  into  our  lives.""  He  said  in  Revelation  3:20,  ""Here  I  am!  I  stand  at  the  door  and  knock.  ""If  anyone  hears  my  voice  and  opens  the  door,  I  will  come  in  and  eat  with  him,  and  he  with  me.""  Confess  your  sins  to  Jesus  today.

"  Understanding  sought  on  “Christian  values”  debate   THE  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  has  called  for  a  calm  assessment  of  the  statement  by  the  Sydney  Wesley  Mission  that  applicants  for  employment  to  its  employment  service  will  be  required  to  have  “Christian  val  ues”.   Council  president  Henry  Mendelson  said  the  issue  is  being  confused  by  what  appeared  to  be  a  misunderstanding  that  unem  ployed  people  applying  for  jobs  in  the  workforce  who  approached  the  Wesley  Mission’s  Employment  Service  would  not  be  considered   for  vacancies  unless  they  demon   strated  a  “Christian  ethos”.   “Given  that  this  is  incorrect  and  that  the  Mission  has  merely  indi  cated  that  people  it  intends  to  employ  should  preferably  be  of  a  Christian  background,  reaction  should  be  tempered  from  such  phraseology  as  “white  suprema  cy”  and  similar  hyperbole,  he   said.   The  Council  recognised  that  the  problem  had  arisen  from  the  Federal  Government’s  employ  ment  service  funding  of  such  organisations  as  the  Wesley   Mission,  which  was  out  of  step  with  the  Uniting  Church  of  Australia  where  matters  of  limita  tion  of  employment  is  concerned.   The  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  has  called  for  a  more  correct  assessment  of  the  issue.  It   believes  the  community  would  not  disagree  that  organisations  which  have  a  religious  back  ground  tend  to  prefer  employees  of  a  similar  background,  as  is  the  case  with  all  denominationally  administered  organisations,  be  they  Jewish,  Anglican  or  Catholic.   He  added  that  the  only  major   issue  is  whether  it  is  correct  for  the  government  to  delegate  its  employment  responsibilities  to  organisations  with  defined  reli  gious  affiliation.  “It  is  obviously  vital  that  the  Wesley  Mission  and  other  organisations  of  religious  backgrounds  which  have  been  granted  government  employment   services  contracts  be  made  to   understand  that  any  action  where  by  employees  discriminate  in  the  preferment  of  job  applicants  of  a  particular  denomination  will  result  in  a  strong  backlash.” ",2000-01-28
"  Christian  supporters  denounce  “racist”  attack   CANBERRA   FILE   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   QUEENSLAND-BASED  Christian  sup  porters  of  Israel  have  attacked  as  false  and  “an  utter  waste  of  our  gov  ernment’s  time  and  money”  a  call  by  Palestinian  representative  in  Australia  Ali  Kazak  to  cancel  the  tax  exempt  status  of  the  “racist”  Jewish  National  Fund  and  other  Australian  fundraising  appeals  for  Israel.   In  a  2500-word  submission  to  the  Federal  Parliament’s  Joint  Foreign  Affairs,  Defence  and  Trade  Committee,  the  fundamentalist  Christians’  Israel  Public  Action  Campaign  (CIPAC)  said  it  disagrees  with  almost  every  statement  which  Mr  Kazak  made  last  September  to  the  committee’s  human  rights  inquiry  into  Australia’s  efforts  to  pro  mote  and  protect  freedom  of  religion   and  belief.   The  CIPAC  submission,  which  the  parliamentary  committee  will  con  sider  at  a  meeting  this  year,  says:  “Ali  Kazak’s  presentation  was  riddled  with  concocted  facts,  misrepresenta  tions  and  lies.  With  these  he  has  woven  a  story  designed  to  elicit  sym  pathy  for  the  Palestinian  Authority  and  to  unleash  indignation  on  the   Israeli  Government.”   When  Mr  Kazak  appeared  before  the  committee,  he  described  “horrif  ic  details  of  gross  violations  commit  ted  by  Israel  against  the  religious   freedom  of  Christians  and  Moslems”,  including  allegations  that  Israel  con  tinues  to  desecrate  Moslem  grave  yards,  mosques  and  holy  sites  and  to  impose  a  “racist”  Law  of  Return  and  other  discriminatory  laws.   Questioned  about  these  claims  at  a  subsequent  session  of  the  parlia  mentary  committee,  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  presi  dent  Nina  Bassat  and  national  vice  president  Jeremy  Jones  explained  that  JNF  funds  raised  in  Australia  were  for  environmental  purposes,  that  Israel  protected  religious  free  doms  to  a  much  larger  degree  than  is  generally  understood  and  that  its  Law  of  Return  was  not  an  abuse  of  religious  freedom.   CIPAC,  which  includes  a  small  Star  of  David  in  its  letterhead  and  says  it  was  “founded  to  educate  and  mobilise  Christians  on  behalf  of  sound  legislation  and  policies  towards  Israel”,  frequently  backs  its  arguments  in  support  of  Israel  with  biblical  quotations.   In  the  recent  past,  it  has  called  for  Australia  to  move  its  embassy  from  Tel  Aviv  to  Jerusalem.  In  its  latest  submission,  it  describes  Jerusalem  as  “the  spiritual  and  political  capital  only  of  the  Jewish  people  for  3000  years”,  and  says  “there  is  ample  his  torical,  archaeological  and  biblical   ""Israel  has  in  fact  granted  more  religious  freedom  in  the  Old  City   than  has  any  ruling  power  for   hundreds  of  years.”   evidence”  to  support  Israel’s  right  to  Jerusalem  as  its  capital.   In  its  comments  on  Mr  Kazak’s  claim  that  Israel  breaches  Muslim  rights  to  religious  freedom  and  has  destroyed  Muslim  holy  sites,  CIPAC’s  submission  says:  “Israel  has  in  fact  granted  more  religious  freedom  in  the  Old  City  than  has  any  ruling  power  for  hundreds  of  years”.   It  says  the  long-established  exis  tence  of  Christian  churches  and  min  istries  contradicts  claims  of  wide  spread  Israeli  abuse  of  the  religious  freedom  of  the  Christian  population  of  Israel.  “While  Christian  tourists  enjoy  a  sense  of  security  while  visit  ing  holy  sites  under  Israeli  control,  they  seldom  venture  to  such  sites  in   Palestinian-controlled  areas  as  Shechem,  Solomon’s  Pools  and  Hebron  due  to  the  high  security  risk,”  it  states.   The  submission  says  Mr  Kazak  blamed  the  Palestinians’  unfortunate  situation  entirely  on  the  Israeli  Government,  while  ignoring  human  rights  abuses  of  its  own  people  by  the  Palestinian  Authority,  including  censorship  of  broadcasts  about  offi  cial  corruption,  misappropriation  of  funds,  torture  in  Palestinian  jails  and  a  death  penalty  for  selling  land  to   Jews.   It  says  that  while  Mr  Kazak  noted  several  “massacres”  which  he  claimed  were  perpetrated  by  the  Israeli  Government  against  the  Palestinian  people,  he  did  not  bal  ance  it  with  documented  massacres  by  Arabs  against  Jewish  people.   The  submission  dismisses  Mr  Kazak’s  claim  that  no  Arab  or  Christian  may  serve  in  the  Israel  Defence  Force,  pointing  out  that  the  defence  establishment  has  expressed  a  clear  interest  in  encour  aging  Christian  and  Muslim  volun   teers.  It  counters  his  claim  of  racism   in  the  Israeli  education  system  by  cit  ing  examples  of  anti-Jewish  state  ments  in  Palestinian  schoolbooks  and  quoting  from  a  Palestinian  Authority  TV  show  in  which  five   year-olds,  surrounded  by  teddy  bears  and  Disney  murals,  recite  bloodthirsty  slogans  advocating  vio  lence  and  suicide  as  a  means  to  an  end.   CIPAC’s  members,  while  claiming  not  to  be  directly  involved,  support  a  resolution  which  reached  the  federal  council  of  the  National  Party  —  the  party’s  top  policy  body  —  last  September,  strongly  supporting  Israel  and  calling  for  the  Coalition  Government  to  recognise  Jerusalem  as  Israel’s  capital.  The  resolution  originated  in  the  National  Party’s  Nicklin  electorate  council,  at  Nambour,  on  Queensland’s  Sunshine  Coast,  and  was  later  adopted  at  the  Queensland  National  Party’s  state  conference.  But  it  was  hastily  with  drawn  at  the  federal  council  conven  tion  in  Canberra  amid  embarrassed  —  and  inaccurate  —  claims  from  senior  party  figures  that  it  had  not  gone  through  the  proper  channels  to  be  included  in  federal  council’s  agen   da.   CIPAC  has  since  sought  an  assur  ance  from  Queensland  National  Party  president  Terry  Bolger  that  the  resolution  will  go  to  the  National  Party  federal  convention  at  Tweed  Heads  in  June.  CIPAC  president  Trish  Small  says  they  are  awaiting  a   response. ",2000-01-07
"  About  600  people  turned  out  at  Home  nightclub  to  raise  funds  for  Young  UlA's  project  at  Ramat   Hadassah  Youth  Village,  which  caters  for  Israeli  youth  from  disadvantaged  backgrounds.  Lisa  and  Debra  Segal,  Sylvia  Malki  and  Daniel  Vasin  were  among  the  guests.   H  Pictures,  page  24   Anglican  leader  active  in  Jewish-Christian  relations   THE  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  has  welcomed  the  election  of  the  Most  Rev  Dr  Peter  Camley  as  Anglican  Primate  of  Australia  as  a  man  committed  to  the  promotion  of  inter  faith  relations.   The  Jewish  community  was  strongly  repre  sented  at  the  installation  of  the  Primate,  which  went  ahead  despite  threats  by  some  church  leaders  to  boycott  it.   Central  Synagogue  Rabbi  Selwyn  Franklin,  who  is  president  of  the  Orthodox  Rabbis  of  Australasia,  Emeritus  Rabbi  Dr  John  Levi  of  Melbourne’s  Temple  Beth  El  and  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  president  Henry  Mendelson  all  attended,  as  did  NSW  Governor  Gordon  Samuel.  Lessons  were  read  by  retired  Governor-General  Sir  Zelman  Cowan.   Mr  Mendelson  welcomed  the  Primate’s  appointment  as  a  positive  step  in  the  relation  ship  between  the  Anglican  Church  and  the  Jewish  community  (the  Sydney  Synod  is  one  of  the  Council’s  sponsoring  bodies).   The  Church  had  elected  a  man  well  known  for  his  ecumenical  strengths,  as  well  as  his  sensitivities  to  the  need  to  consolidate  the  beginnings  of  the  dialogue  between  the  two  denominations,  he  said.   “It  is  a  matter  of  record  that  Dr  Carnley  was  instrumental  in  assisting  the  establishment  of  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  in  Western  Australia  and  has  frequently  been  a  leading  force  in  establishing  interfaith  dialogue”,  Mr   Mendelson  added.   During  his  installation  address,  the  Most  Rev  Carnley  made  several  references  to  the  need  for  the  Anglican  Church  to  broaden  its  vision.  “Without  a  global  revolution  in  the  sphere  of  human  consciousness,  nothing  will  change  for  the  better”,  he  declared.   The  Anglican  Synod  went  out  of  its  way  to  demonstrate  its  awareness  of  the  need  to  recognise  the  wider  community  with  the  wel  coming  sounds  of  the  didgeridoo  and  an  address  by  a  member  of  the  Iora  people,  on  whose  land  the  cathedral  stands.  Four  school  students  from  families  who  come  from  over  seas  read  prayers  in  their  own  languages.   The  Most  Rev  Carnley  said  the  Church  has  lost  touch  with  vast  numbers  of  its  members.  “At  the  same  time,  in  the  context  of  the  tragic  brokenness  of  the  present  world,  we  also  have  responsibilities  to  foster  dialogue  with  other  faiths,”  he  said.

"  ?   A  man  asked  God  how  long  a  million  years  was  to  him.  God  replied,  ""It's  just  like  a  single  second  of  your  time,  my  child.""  So  the  man  asked,  ""What  about  a  million  dollars?""  The  Lord  replied,  ""To  me,  it's  just  like  a  single  penny.""  The  man  gathered  himself  up  and  said,  ""Well  Lord,  could  I  have  one  of  your  pennies?""  And  God  said,  ""Certainly,  my  child,  just  a  second!""  The  words  of  a  well  know  song  writer  say,'  'I  don't  know  what  tomorrow  holds,  but  I  know  who  holds  tomorrow"".  We  plan  our  holidays  and  shopping  sprees,  the  things  that  give  us  pleasure.  But  where  are  you  going  to  spend  eternity?  Have  you  planned  your  life  to  include  God  or  have  you  left  Him  out?   The  God  who  holds  tomorrow,  holds  your  future.  Have  you  planned  to  spend  the  future  with  God  in  Eternity?  Luke  12:19-21  says,  ""And  I'll  say  to  myself,  'You  have  plenty  of  good  things  laid  up  for  many  years.  Take  life  easy;  eat,  drink  and  be  merry.'  But  God  said  to  him,  'You  fool!  This  very  night  your  life  will  be  demanded  from  you.  Then  who  will  get  what  you  have  prepared  for  yourself?'  This  is  how  it  will  be  with  anyone  who  stores  up  things  for  himself  but  is  not  rich  toward  God.""  Maybe  we  think  that  we  don't  need  to  worry  about  our  future,  that  it  will  take  care  of  it's  self.   Are  we  prepared  for  eternity,  or  are  we  like  the  man  in  the  story?  Are  we  looking  for  the  things  that  are  beyond  our  reach,  things  that  we  think  will  make  us  happy?  Things  to  fill  the  empty  parts  of  our  lives.  Will  you  be  really  any  happier  if  you  get  all  that  you  want,  even  though  it  may  only  appear  for  a  second,  then  it's  all  gone?  Are  you  waiting  for  God?  Jesus  has  promised  to  return,  He  is  coming  back  for  us.  We  need  to  be  ready,  as  we  don't  know  the  time  or  the  hour  of  His  return.  Jesus'  purpose  in  telling  us  about  His  return  is  to  warn  us  to  be  ready.  Will  you  be  ready  when  He  returns?  Where  will  you  spend  eternity?

"  Make  the  world  a  better  place   Christian  Horizon   During  January,  I  had  the  oppor-  tunity  to  attend  a  national  confer-  ence  in  Sydney  on  the  issues  surrounding  spirituality  in  2000  Australia.  The  last  of  the  keynote  speakers  for  the  week  was  Sonia  Wagner,  a  Catholic  religious  sister.  Sr  Sonia  is  both  an  academic  and  a  church  leader.  Her  theme  was  ""Dream  the  Future:  Honour  the  Spirit"".  Her  basic  premise  was  that,  as  a  people,  we  need  big  dreams,  we  need  to  live  for  something  beyond  our-  selves.  As  a  people,  we  need  a  place  to  deposit  our  goodwill.  What  we  need  as  a  people  is  vision,  for  as  Proverbs  says:  ""Where  there  is  no  vision,  the  people  perish"".  Having  a  vision  challenges  us  to  ask  the  questions  that  don't  even   exist  yet,  with  the  question  of  the  future  being  ""Why  not?"".  As  we  look  to  our  world,  the  statement  to  be  made  is  ""Wouldn't  it  be  wonderful  if...""  rather  than  ""How  terrible  that...  !"".  As  we  look  to  our  future  we  must  ask  ourselves:  ""Do  we  see  threat  or  opportunity,  do  we  see  gift  or  problem?""  This  can  be  frightening  stuff  but  we  can  do  it  together.  In  our  world  today  there  is  a  conspiracy  of  powerlessness  and  pessimism.  Such  a  conspiracy  acts  against  our  asking  the  big  ques-   tions,  acts  against  our  working  for  a  vision  and  acts  to  isolate  us  from  one  another.  So  we  run  the  risk  of  becoming  stunted  in  our  growth,  as  a  community  and  as  a  nation  and  simply  hiding  alone  in  fear  of  what  could  happen.  Today's  political  correctness  de-  mands  that  we  be  optimistic.  The  creating  of  a  vision  does  not  demand  false  optimism  but  rather  a  healthy  approach  in  facing  our  reality  and  building  on  it  together  as  a  people.  We  are  challenged  together  to  be  bold  and  pro-active  and  to  ask  the   big  questions.  In  commenting  on  present  day  Australia,  Hugh  Mackay  says  that  we  see  cross-  currents  of  confusion  with  under-  currents  of  hope.  We  live  in  a  world  that  is  a  mixed  bag.  That's  life.  The  mess-  age  is  that  we  don't  have  to  be  ruled  by  fear,  while  there  is  fear  nor  do  we  have  to  be  dragged  down  by  our  woes  and  troubles,  but  we  can  have  a  go  and  make  a  go  of  it  together.  We  can  make  our  world  a  better  place  for  our  having  been  here  but  we  need  each  other  to  do  it.   Fr  John  Murray  OSA,  Pastor  of  St  Mary's,  Echuca. ",2000-02-11

Une  semaine  après  le  triomphe  de  Rotterdam,  tous  deux  sont  arrivés  en  vacances  en  Calédonie.  Né  en  1970  à  Lifou,  la  plus  grande  des  îles  de  l'archipel  des  Loyauté,  le  joueur  kanak  vient  de  signer  un  contrat  de  quatre  ans  avec  le  club  anglais   de  Middlesbrough  (la  D1  anglaise).  «  J'avais  envie  d'aller  en  Angleterre.

"  God  is  ready  to  help  us  through   'Jockey  beats  horse  over  the  finish  line'  read  the  newspaper  headline.  How  could  that  be?  Apparently  the  jockey  beat  the  pack  by  20  lengths  and  his  horse  by  one  length  when  he  was  catapulted  out  of  the  saddle  and  over  the  finish  line.,.  .  His  horse  who  had  tripped,  followed  soon  after.  But  the  victory  went  to  the  one  who  finished  second,  named  'Slip  Up'.  A  race  official  said  the  jockey,  ""was  so  far  in  front  that  only  a  freak  accident  would  stop  him"",  and  that's  what  happened.  We've  all  experienced  life's  unexpected  happenings.  •  The  author  of  the  book  of   Ecclesiastes  took  note  of  them  when  he  said,  ""The  race  is  not  to  the  swift,  nor  the  battle  to  the  strong.""  (Ecc.  9:11)  He  reflected  on  the  fact  that  man  is  not  the  master  of  his  destiny,  as  he  so  often  thinks  he  is.  When  we  face  hardship  and  difficulty  it's  easy  to  lose  sight  of  the  big  picture.  It's  easy  to  feel  we  are  alone  and  that  we  need  to  work  it  out  ourselves,  and  be  independent.  We  need  to  remember  that  God  our  creator  is  alive  and  ready  to  help  us.  We  need  to  take  our  eyes  off  our  circumstances  and  put  them  instead  on  the  creator  of  all  things  and  all  circumstances.  The  apostle  Paul  learnt  this  lesson   and  was  able  to  say  in  Hebrews  12:1,  ""Let  us  throw  off  everything  that  hinders  us  and  the  sin  that  so  easily  entangles,  and  let  us  run  with  perseverance  the  race  marked  out  for  us"".  Life  is  a  race  that  must  be  run.  The  only  way  we  can  be  victorious  is  by  putting  our  trust  in  God  and  keeping  our  eyes  on  Jesus,  We  need  to  run  for  and  with  Him  not  ourselves,  and  we  must  always  keep  Him  in  our  sight.

"  Edited  by  Peter  Scott  Email:  peteyegeottcom.wowiau8a.com   Awkward,  but  a  lot  of  fun,  says  Jewish  player  in  Christian  team   Peter  Scott   BEING  the  only  Jew  in  a  party  of  dozens  of  Christian  basketball  and  volleyball  players  on  tour  of  Australia,  is  a  little  awkward  at  times,  but  the  games  are  fun.   inis  is  tne  juagement  or  ju-year-oia  marcus   Berley,  who  is  part  of  the  2000  touring  party  of  Northwest  Camps  (NBC).  Based  in  Washington  State,  it  is  one  of  America’s  largest  such  organi  sations,  with  more  than  8000  boys  and  girls  attending  its  30-plus  camps  in  three  countries  each  year—and  it  is  soon  to  expand  to  Australia.   “It’s  kind  of  awkward  [to  be  an  NBC  tourist]  and  I  was  worried  that  I  would  feel  a  little  uncom   ^  fortable  when  prayers  were  said,”  Berley  con   fessed  in  Sydney  last  week.  But  many  of  his  mis  givings,  if  not  his  scepticism,  disappeared  almost  as  soon  as  the  tour  got  underway.   With  a  religious  presentation  part  and  parcel  of  each  of  NBC’s  tour  spots  —  featuring  a  few  songs  and  some  personal  comments  from  the  high  school-age  youngsters  and  coaches  making  up  the  party  —  it  came  as  a  surprise  to  Berley  that   he  was  voted  by  his  peers  to  be  the  first  speaker   on  tour.   So,  between  games  against  Redfem  PCYC  at  Sydney  University’s  Sports  Centre,  he  explained  that  given  that  he  is  Jewish,  he  does  not  have  “a  personal  relationship  with  Jesus  Christ”.  Nevertheless,  that  doesn’t  mean  that  he  is  unap  preciative  of  NBC’s  ethical  and  behavioural  mes   sages.   And  how  did  a  Jewish  boy  end  up  in  a  Christian  sports  camp,  followed  by  a  tour  to  Australia?  He  went  to  NBC  camps  because  some  of  his  best  friends  did.  “On  balance  I’m  having  a  great  time;  1  love  the  basketball  and  the  compa  ny.”   What  he  did  baulk  at  a  little  was  the  rigid  regi  men  of  tour  duties,  such  as  keeping  a  daily  jour  nal,  finding  its  lack  of  spontaneity—“you  have  to  do  it”—a  bit  too  restrictive.  “I  doubt  that  anyone  will  come  away  more  religious  because  of  it,”  he   said.   An  iconoclastic  character,  Berley  is  the  classic  questioning  type.  He  is  unabashed  in  claiming  that  Judaism’s  practice  is  more  questioning  in  its   outlook  than  Christianity—at  least  in  its  Ketorm  and  Conservative  streams.   A  student  at  Seattle’s  Garfield  Public  High  School,  he  loves  public  speaking  and  is  an  active  participant  in  the  school’s  sporting  culture,  per  forming  best  in  basketball  and  tennis.  But  this  is  about  to  come  to  an  end,  as  he  contemplates  the  choice  of  college  courses  for  next  September  and  life  beyond  the  cosy  world  of  teenage  schooling.   The  tour  to  Australia  with  NBC  is  likely  to  be  his  sporting  swan-song,  and  he  is  now  concen  trating  on  other  matters,  including  his  Jewishness  in  the  wake  of  a  study  tour  to  Israel  earlier  this  year,  which  he  described  as  “an  incredible  experience”.   He  is  also  interested  in  participating  in  the  Maccabiah  Games  sometime  in  the  future.  But  knowing  Maccabi  politics  around  the  world,  it  did  not  come  as  a  surprise  that  neither  he,  nor  any  of  his  Jewish  sporting  friends,  have  even  the  slightest  inkling  of  what  happened  to  the  Australian  and  Austrian  athletes  on  the  Yarkon  River  bridge  three  years  ago.   USA  Maccabi  cannot  be  said  to  have  indulged   Marcus  Barley  works  the  crowd  at  an  NBC  game  in  Sydney.   in  a  campaign  of  information  of  any  consequence  for  its  constituency,  which  should,  one  supposes,  be  kept  in  mind  whenever  they  do  claim  to  speak  on  behalf  of  the  American  Jewish  sporting  com  munity.   In  the  meantime,  though,  Marcus  Berley  is  busy  in  Australia  doing  what  he  likes  best  —  scoring  points  and  running  plays  from  his  point  guard’s  position  on  a  basketball  court,  where  religious  beliefs  don’t  matter  in  the  least.   What  does  matter  is  how  good  you  are  —  and  having  seen  this  178cm  youngster  in  action,  it  is  safe  to  state  that  he  is  very,  very  good  indeed. ",2000-07-14
"  Aussie  transmitters  to  broadcast  Christian  messages  to  Asia   Muslims  to  retaliate  with  all  day  Cat  Stevens  broadcasts   DARWIN,  Sunday:  The  Australian  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  Government  has  leased  a  former  Radio  Australia  transmitter  near  Darwin  to  a  British  Christian  funda-  mentalist  group  called  Christian  Voice.  The  group  plans  to  use  the   transmitter  to  broadcast  their  Christian  message  to  a  predominantly  Islamic  South-East  Asia,  an  area  renown  for  religious  tension.  But  Indonesia's  Muslim  President  Wahid  has  vowed  to  retaliate  by  broadcasting  Muslim  pop-artist,  Cat  Steven's  songs  24  hours  a  day  until  Australia  backs  down.  ""We  think  that  Yussuf  Islam,  as  he  is  now  known,  will  have  much  to  teach  the  heathens  in  Australia.  We'll  be  playing  the  song  'Cat's  in  the  Cradle',  that  was  so  mov  ingly  covered  by  Ugly  Kit  Joe.  And  then  there's  his  instructive  song  that  explains  what  to  do  when  you're  being  followed  by  a  moonshadow.""  The  Foreign  Minister,  Mr  Alexander  Downer,  is  taking  the  diplomatic  situ-  ation  seriously  but  has  been  unwilling  to  stop  the  deal.  ""While  I  don't  condone  religious  fundamentalism,""  Mr  Downer  said,  ""at  least  it's  our  kind  of  fundamental-  ism.""  Meanwhile,  the  chairman  of  the   ABC,  Mr  Donald  McDonald,  has  defended  the  original  decision  to  close  the  Radio  Australia  transmitter  in  Darwin  and  move  it  to  southern  Victoria.  ""It  was  a  necessary  cost-cutting  decision,  brought  on  by  a  Federal  Government  that  very  well  under-  stands  the  needs  of  our  region  and  our  place  in  it.  It  means  that  all  the  coun-  tries  south  of  Australia  can  hear  us   loud  and  clear  and  that  seems  to  be  where  our  support  lies.""  Christian  Voice  will  stick  to  its  plans  to  broadcast,  despite  the  controversy.

"  PACIFIQUE   Première  tournée  dans  le  Pacifique-sud  de  Christian  Paul,  nouveau  Secrétaire  d'Etat  à  Poutre-mer   Les  dix  derniers  jours  d'octobre  ont  vu  le  nouveau  secrétaire  d'E  à  l'Outre-mer  Christian  Paul  effectuer  une  grande  tournée  dan  Pacifique  Sud.  Il  s'est  successivement  rendu  en  Nouvelle-Caléd  à  Wallis  et  Futuna,  et  en  la  Polynésie  française  pour  faire  le  poin  l'évolution  statutaire  et  des  problèmes  économiques  et  sociaux  de  c  territoires.   Il  s'est  également  rendu  à  Kiribati  pour  rencontrer  les  participants  au  sommet  des  16  pays  du  Forum  du  Pacifique,  où  la  Nouvelle-Calédonie  a  obtenu  l'an  dernier  le  statut  d'observateur.  La  participation  croissante  de  la  Nouvelle-Calédonie  à  des  actions  de  coopération  régionale  est  en  partie  le  résultat  de  l'accord  de  Nouméa  qui  prévoit  explicitement  la  possibilité  de  son  émancipation.  En  Nouvelle-Calédonie  En  Nouvelle-Calédonie  qu'il  découvrait  pour  la  première  fois,  Christian  Paul  a  beaucoup  écouté.  Il  a  surtout  entendu  des  demandes  d'argent  et  autres  récriminations.  Dès  son  arrivée  à  Nouméa  le  23  octobre,  le  ministre  a  participé  à  l'inauguration  du  8ème  festival  des  arts  du  Pacifique  sud.  Durant  son  séjour  en  Calédonie,  Christian  Paul  a  rencontré  les  responsables  du  RPCR  (Rassemblement  pour  la  Calédonie  dans  la  République,  antiindépendantiste)  etdu  FLNKS  (Frontde  UbérationNationaleKanakSocialiste,  indépendantiste),  et  visité  les  trois  provinces  de  l'archipel.  A  Wallis  et  Futuna  Le  ministre  s'est  ensuite  rendu  à  Wallis  et  Futuna  pour  une  première  prise  de  contactaveclesélus,  lesroiset  autres  autorités  coutumières.  La  rénovation  du  statut  de  ce  petit  territoire  de  15  000  habitants,  qui  date  de  1961  a  été  abordée,  ainsi  que  les  incidences  de  l'accord  de  Nouméa.  11  se  trouve,  en  effet,  que  les20000Wallisiens  etfutuniensquiviventenNouvelle-Calédonie  se  posent  des  questions  quant  à  leur  avenir,  du  fait  que  l'accord  de  Nouméa  autorise  la  Nlle-Caiédonie  à  prendre  des  mesures  pour  favoriser  l'emploi  de  ses  propres  citoyens.  Christian  Paul  a  promis  un  accord  en  décembre.   Parmi  les  diverses  réclamations  (des  sous  pour  une  bibliothèque,  pourune  maison  de  retraite,  pour  une  desserte  maritime,  etc),  l'un  des  rois  de  Futuna  a  réclamé  «  une  résidence  digne  de  ses  fonctions»...  En  Polynésie  Française  En  Polynésie,  Christian  Paul  a  participé  à  la  réunion  annuelle  du  comité  de  suivi  du  Pacte  de  progrès  mis  en  place  pour  dix  ans  afin  d'aider  le  territoire  à  réduire  sa  dépendance  visà-vis  de  la  métropole  grâce  au  développement  économique.  Cette  réunion  était  l'occasion  pour  l'Etat  de  s'assurer  que  l'utilisations  des  fonds  correspond  aux  objectifs  choisis  à  l'origine.  L'évolutiondu  statutde  la  Polynésie  vers  une  autonomie  encore  accrue,  votéeparle  Parlementmais  qui  attend  une  revision  de  la  Constitution,  ainsi  que  la  réforme  du  statut  des  communes  ont  aussi  été  évoquées  lors  des  rencontres  de  M.  Paul  avec  les  dirigeants  politiques  polynésiens.  Il  a  constaté  les  velléités  du  Territoire  d'élargir  les  frontières  de  son  statut  d'autonomie,  et  les  relations  acrimonieuses  qu'entretiennent  pouvoir  et  opposition.  Les  sourciisfroncés,  Christian  Paul  a  écouté  le  président  du  gouvernement  du  Territoire,  le  sénateur  RPR  Gaston  Flosse,  lui  adresser  sa  «  réprobation  »  sur  le  second  contrat  de  développement  pour  la  période2000-2004,  qu'il  a  refusé  de  signer  personnellement  parce  qu'il  en  conteste  certains  choix.  «  L'Etat  n'est  pas  un  guichet,  c'est  un  partenaire  »,  lui  a  rétorqué  le  ministre.

"  Feature   It’s  been  1000  years  coming  and  it’s   already  a  week  old,   but  Israel  is  still  not  prepared  for  the  massive  influx  of  tourists  who  have  begun  arriving   because  of  the   Christian  millennium.  Avi  Machlis  reports.   WHEN  Fonville  Winans   packed  a  small  bottle  of  Salvation  Hot  Sauce  into  his  luggage  while  preparing  for  a  trip  to  Israel  from  the  United  States,  he  had  no  idea  it  would  label  him  as  a  security  threat  upon  checking  into  El  A1  at  Newark  Airport.   Perhaps  the  alert  was  triggered  by  the  condiment’s  depiction  of  a  preacher  baptising  a  voluptuous  woman,  or  the  slogan  on  the  bottle  —  “One  taste  of  this  and  you  get   saved”.   Maybe  it  was  because  Winans,  a  28-year-old  Christian  painter  and  photographer  from  Baron  Rouge,  Los  Angeles,  had  his  luggage  trans  ferred  directly  from  his  connecting  flight  and  was  checking  in  with  just  a  carry-on  bag  and  one-way  ticket.   Whatever  the  reason,  Winans  had  been  to  Israel  three  times  before  and  was  familiar  with  secu  rity  protocol.  But  nothing  pre  pared  him  for  the  two-hour  grilling  that  ended  with  Israeli  security  personnel  confiscating  five  cans  of  coffee,  a  tape-recorder,  a  calcula  tor,  a  Hebrew-English  electronic  translator.  And  the  hot  sauce.  “I  have  been  to  Israel  before,”  Winans  says.  “But  this  time  it  was  different.  They  wanted  to  know  my  beliefs.  The  fact  that  as  a  believer,  I  cannot  come  and  see  the  places  Jesus  came  from  without  a  hassle  really  made  me  feel  violated.”   After  months  of  media  hype  about  the  threats  Israel  may  face  from  fringe  doomsday  millennialist  cults,  it  is  no  surprise  that  Israel  has  beefed  up  security.  Israeli  offi  cials  say  such  security  is  a  neces  sity  and  it  is  better  to  be  safe  than  sorry.  However,  if  even  a  fraction  of  the  more  than  two  million  Christian  tourists  expected  in  Israel  during  2000  are  scrutinised   as  Winans  was,  they  may  return  home  with  tainted  impressions  of   Israel.   And  security  is  just  one  issue  on  a  long  list  of  millennial  matters  for  which  Israel’s  unpreparedness  may  cost  it  a  huge  amount  of  potential  goodwill  from  pilgrims.  Even  without  an  interrogation,  entering  the  Jewish  State  isn’t  always  easy.  The  24  counters  at  passport  control  at  Ben-Gurion  International  Airport  are  increas  ingly  overwhelmed  by  growing  numbers  of  tourists.  At  peak  hours,  the  wait  can  take  more  than  90  minutes.   Although  the  government  will  soon  add  another  10  counters,  the  airport  remains  a  symbol  of  Israel’s  unpreparedness  for  the  millennium  rush.  Just  outside  the  airport,  cranes  and  bulldozers  are  working  furiously  to  build  a  new  complex  known  as  Ben-Gurion  2000.  The  plan  was  to  have  a  mod  ern  airport  in  place  for  the  millen  nium;  instead,  say  critics,  the  pro  ject  should  be  renamed  Ben  Gurion  2002,  because  that  is  when  it  will  probably  be  ready.   Even  some  government  officials  admit  that  the  late  arrival  of  the  airport  is  symptomatic  of  a  larger  failure  to  prepare  for  the  year  2000.  According  to  Yossi  Noy,  director  general  of  Administration  2000  —  the  government  authority  co-ordi  nating  $US100  million  of  preparato  ry  investments  for  tourism  this  year  —  the  problem  is  bureaucra  cy.  Noy,  the  third  director  of  an  office  established  in  1998,  came  on  the  job  in  September  last  year.  His  two  predecessors  quit  after  realis  ing  that  they  could  not  get  any  thing  done  because  of  rivalling  government  ministries.   “I  came  in  time  to  get  some  things  done,  but  there  is  not  enough  time  to  do  everything  nec  essary,  such  as  heavy  works  which  should  have  been  done  two  or  three  years  ago,”  says  Noy.  “We  are  still  trying  to  do  the  best  for  the  tourists  and  make  their  stay  in  Israel  more  comfortable.”   Most  of  the  focus  now  is  on  building  additional  toilets  and  parking  facilities  at  poorly  equipped  holy  sites.  Yet  the  biggest  challenge  will  be  traffic,  and  it  is  too  late  to  start  building  and  expanding  roads  as  pilgrims  start  to  arrive  in  ever-increasing  numbers.  According  to  Israel’s  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics,  196,100  tourists  arrived  by  air  in  October  —  a  23  percent  jump  com  pared  to  the  same  month  in  1998.  Total  arrivals  for  the  month  reached  282,200  —  a  record  turnout  for  October.  The  total  of  tourists  for  the  year  2000  could  well  exceed  three  million,  far   exceeding  the  1.5-2  million  who  come  annually.   In  Nazareth,  where  a  dispute  between  local  Muslims  and  Christians  has  cast  a  shadow  over  the  anticipated  tourism  boom,  the  narrow  streets  leading  to  the  main  sites  are  becoming  even  more  con  gested  as  busloads  of  pilgrims  descend  upon  the  city.   The  same  is  happening  in  Jerusalem,  especially  around  the  Old  City,  where  the  recent  increase  in  tourism  has  already  given  traffic  cops  a  taste  of  millennial  traffic  jams.  Tourist  traffic  at  the  sites  themselves  also  poses  a  problem.  Some  sites  reported  a  35  percent   increase  in  the  number  of  visitors  in  November,  and  are  making  spe  cial  arrangements  for  masses  of   tourists.   But  the  Church  of  the  Holy  Sepulchre  —  one  of  the  holiest  sites  —  will  be  a  particular  prob  lem.  For  five  years  Israel  has  been  begging  the  three  patriarchs  from  different  denominations  who  con  trol  the  site  to  open  an  exit  door  that  could  double  the  capacity.  Without  it,  the  church  will  be  unable  to  cope  with  huge  numbers  of  pilgrims,  especially  on  holidays,  when  the  church  will  become  a  fire  hazard.   Millennium  watchers  also  shud  der  at  the  tight  security  measures  expected  if  Pope  John  Paul  II  visits,  as  planned,  in  March.  He  is  expect  ed  in  Israel  from  March  21  to  26.  “I  spoke  to  a  friend  in  the  Israeli  Foreign  Ministry  and  he  thought  the  city  would  have  to  be  evacuat  ed,”  said  Reverend  Michael  McGarry,  Catholic  Rector  of  the  Tantur  Ecumenical  Institute  for  Theological  Studies  straddling   Jerusalem  and  Bethlehem.   A  visit  by  the  Pope  will  also  be  fraught  with  political  pitfalls.  Every  utterance  at  an  Israeli  or  Palestinian  site  will  be  monitored  by  both  sides.  “It  is  a  minefield,”  McGarry  says.  “No  matter  where  he  steps,  everything  will  be  over  interpreted.  He  has  made  it  clear  that  his  visit  will  be  religious  and  not  political.  But  he  is  smart  enough  to  understand  that  every  thing  will  be  understood  political  ly.”   The  total  of  tourists  for  the   year  2000  could  well   exceed  three  million,  far  exceeding  the  1.5-2   million  who  come  annually.   Some  observers  think  Israel’s  unpreparedness  may  cost  it  politi  cal  goodwill  which  it  hoped  to  reap  by  hosting  so  many  tourists.  Most  Christian  tourists  will  visit  must  see  sites  in  Jerusalem  and   Palestinian-controlled  Bethlehem,  where  Palestinian  Authority  Chairman  Yasser  Arafat  has  gone  out  of  his  way  to  create  a  festive  atmosphere.   “I  hope  they  can  go  away  saying  to  themselves  that  Israel  is  a  place  they  want  to  come  back  to,”  said  Reverend  Charles  Kopp,  director  of  the  United  Christian  Council  in  Israel.  “But  I  would  think  they  would  make  at  least  something  in  Jerusalem  to  give  the  people  com  ing  for  the  millennium  a  sense  that  there  is  something  special.  You  don’t  get  that  feeling  anywhere  in  Jerusalem.  I  know  in  Bethlehem   they  are  going  to  pull  out  the  stops,  and  it  will  definitely  play  into  the  tourists’  experience.   “Arafat  will  get  involved  in  the  Nazareth  issue  and  try  and  paint  himself  as  defender  of  Christian  rights.  I  don’t  trust  him  for  a  minute,  but  tourists  will  come  away  with  their  impressions.”   Part  of  the  problem  lies  with  the  Orthodox  Chief  Rabbinate.  On  one  hand,  it  made  an  exception  and  allowed  Christian  groups  to  hold  a  gala  celebration  on  Christmas  Eve  at  the  Binyanei  Ha’ooma  conven  tion  centre.  However,  it  set  tough  restrictions  on  hotels  catering  to  Christian  tourists.  Hotels  were  asked  to  maintain  a  “Jewish  atmos  phere”  in  public  areas  during  the  holiday,  meaning  no  Christmas  trees  were  permitted  in  lobbies,  and  New  Year’s  Eve  parties  could  not  have  music  (because  of  Shabbat).  The  restrictions  were  part  of  an  agreement  between  hotels  and  the  rabbinate,  which  could  in  theory  rescind  kashrut  licences  to  non-compliant  hotels.   Despite  these  challenges,  Israeli  officials  remain  upbeat.  “We  will  make  every  effort  to  make  sure  that  Christian  tourists  and  tourists  feel  welcome,”  Israel  Government  spokesman  Moshe  Fogel  said.  “The  experience  in  Jerusalem,  Nazareth  and  around  the  Sea  of  Galilee  has  proved  to  be  a  very  powerful  expe  rience  in  the  past.  This  goes  on  every  year,  and  there  are  tourists  who  come  back  many  times  over.   “The  millennium  is  not  a  nation  al  holiday  in  Israel,”  he  added.  “The  religious  aspects  are  being  celebrated  by  the  churches,  and  in  that  context  the  government  has   provided  assistance.”   JTA ",2000-01-07

Best  of  all,  Movieguide  delivers  stats  on  the  movie's  moral  outrageousness.  The  catalogue  of  sins  for  this  one  poor  production:  '(AbAb,  PaPaPa,  C,  LLL,  VVV,  SSS,  NN,  AA,'DD,  Ho,  MM)  Anti-Christian  worldview  of  three  mostly  pagan  characters,  with  some  Christian  elements;  104  obscenities,  15  profanities,  some  obscene  gestures,  &amp;  crude  talk  about  sex;  unreal  istic,  brutal  boxing  violence  &amp;  other  incidental,  violence  such  as  image  of  dead  body  after  terrific  car  crash,  push  ing,  woman  socks  other  woman  in  jaw,  &amp;  rich  man   slaps  woman,  knocking  her  to  the  ground;  depicted  for  nication  by  professed  Christian  man,  sexual  situa  tions  played  for  'humor,  implied  oral  sex,  depicted  sodomy,  &amp;  prostitution  all  played  mostly  for  laughs  &amp;  entertainment;  upper  &amp;  rear  male  &amp;  female  nudity;  alco  hol  use  &amp;  drunkenness;  smoking  &amp;  man  shown  in  drug  coma;  boxer  confesses  to  homosexual  experimenta  tion  in  the  past  &amp;  has  visions  of  male  nudity  dur  ing  crucial  moment;  and,  bickering,  lying,  gambling,  legal  fraud,  &amp;  professed  Christian  states  erroneous  religious  views.'  Among  other  flaws,  it's  good  to  be  aware  that  Anna  and  the  King  contains  'upper  male  nudity.'  The  MovieGuide  also  lists  femi  nism  as  one  of  the  obscene  features  of  Primary  Colors.  Another  gem  is  the  Movieguide  FAQ,  which  includes:  'How  can  your  writers  sit  through  all  those  nasty,  immoral  movies?  MOVIEGUIDE  reviews  every  theatrically  released  movie.  Some  of  them  con   tain  a  great  deal  of  immoral  ity.  Although  we  believe  that  'it  is  not  what  goes  into  your  body,  which  makes  you  unclean,  but  what  conies  out,'  we  take  steps  to  minimize  the  amount  of  'vain  things  placed  before  our  eyes.'  We  space  out  our  review  watching  by  using  several  critics,  and  we  are  sensitive  to  critic's  wishes  to  not  see  certain  kinds  of  movies.  We  also  encourage  all  to  be  active  in  prayer  and  worship  throughout  the  week.  That  way,  we  can  fol  low  the  admonition,  to,  'Do  not  be  overcome  by  evil  but  overcome  evil  with  good.'  We  firmly  believe  that  part  of  this  overcoming  victory  is  to  equip  others  like  your  self  with  the  truth  about  a  movie  so  that  all  can  be  firmly  prepared.  We  always  welcome  your  prayers.'  Meanwhile,  in  the  South  Park  movie,  we  can  look  forward  to  '(AbAbAb,  LLL,  VVV,  SSS,  MNM,  A,  DD,  MMM)  Anti-Christian,  anti-God,  anti-morality,  intentionally  immoral,  with  the  most  vile  content  in  the  history  of  mainstream  moviemaking;  340  counted  obscenities  (there  may  be   more  that  are  muddled),  14  profanities  &amp;  many  disgust  ing  bodily  functions,  includ  ing  vomiting;  bloody  vio-  lence  including  ripping  out  heart,  ripping  body  parts  apart,  splattering  blood  &amp;  putting  heart  in  micro-wave  oven;  extreme  sex  including  homosexuality  &amp;  pedophil-  ia;  extreme  nudity  including  pictures  of  male  &amp;  female  genitalia,  &amp;  jokes  about  the  same;  smoking  by  young  boy  &amp;  drug  use  including  hash  pipe;  and,  rebellion,  theft,  lying,  cheating,  &amp;  a  surplusage  of  other  depraved  content.'

"  Private  school  planned  for  Port  Lincoln   A  NEW  non-denominational  private  Christian  school  will  be  established  in  Port  Lincoln  in  time  for  the  beginning  of  the  2002  school  year,  if  its  organising  body  can  generate  enough  support  for  the  plan.  The  Flinders  Association  for  Christian  Education  (FACE),  revealed  its  plan  for  Port  Lincoln's  second  private  school  on  Tuesday,  announcing  the  group  needs  to  secure  registrations  for  25  students  by  mid-  September  for  the  State  Government  to  give  a  green  light  to   the  project.  The  co-educational  school,  to  be  named  Flinders  Christian  College,  already  has  ten  children  registered  as  its  first  students.  The  college  will  initially  operate  as  a  reception  to  year  seven  school,  with  plans  for  expansion  in  subsequent  years  to  include  secondary  school  students  and  a  boarding  school.  A  site  has  not  yet  been  finalised  for  the  new  school  however  two  possible  locations  have  been  identified.  Negotiations  over  the  sites  are  currently   being  conducted  with  the  Port  Lincoln  City  Council  and  the  State  Government.  The  plan  has  been  welcomed  by  Member  for  Flinders  Liz  Penfold,  who  hailed  the  announcement  as  a  way  of  relieving  existing  stress  on  the  region's  schools.  ""I  think  there's  a  need  out  there,""  Mrs  Flinders  said.  ""The  Junior  Primary  School  and  the  Primary  School  have  been  under  pressure  for  some  time,  theplaying  areas  are  not  large  enough.  ""Certainly  the   Christian  school  will  relieve  some  of  that  pressure.  ""I  think  it  will  take  the  pressure  off  particularly  the  Junior  Primary  School  which  I  think  is  overcrowded.""  Government  regulations  will  restrict  the  size  of  the  school  within  its  first  five  years  to  ensure  it  does  not  have  more  than  a  20  per  cent  effect  on  enrolments  in  existing  schools  in  Port  Lincoln  and  surrounding  areas.  FACE  board  chairman  Darryn  Johnston  said  the  school  would   have  a  focus  on  biblical  values  and  discipline.  ""I  think  if  you  look  at  our  country  and  the  way  that  our  forefathers  came  to  this  place  it's  all  based  on  Christian  principles  that  are  slowly  disappearing  from  our  everyday  life,""  Mr  Johnston  said.  ""I  believe  the  town  is  big  enough  to  have  another  school.""  He  said  the  school  would  have  a  focus  on  the  arts.  ""We  would  like  to  see  music  and  the  arts  be  more  of  a  focus.""  FACE  board  member  John  Fraser  said  now   that  the  decision  to  goahead  with  the  school  had  been  made  the  focus  was  on  getting  registered  students  on  its  books.  ""We're  letting  the  ^community  know  what  we're  going  to  do.  ""All  we  need  is  the  25  kids  and  we  will  go   ahead  in  2002.""  The  Port  Lincoln  school  will  be  linked  with  the  national  organisation  Christian  Parent  Controlled  School  which  has  more  than  80  schools  under  its  umbrella  throughout  Australia.

"  School  funding  defended   An  independent  school  in  Echuca  has  defended  the  new  funding  formula  for  schools.  River  City  Christian  College  principal  Alan  Beasy  said  criticism  of  the  socio-economic  status  (SES)  formula  to  be  applied  to  all  schools  as  part  of  the  State  Grants  (Primary  and  Secondary  Education  Assistance)  Bill  2000  was  unfair.  Under  the  SES  formula  school  grants  would  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  socio-economic  status  of  the  families  whose  children  are  enrolled  at  a  particular  school.  The  new  funding  formula  would  replace  a  system  of  funding  based  on  the  average  government  school  recurrent  cost.  '  'So  if  a  school  went  out  and  made  money  for  itself  by  fundraising,  it  looked  more  profitable,  the  government  wouldn't  give  it  as  much  money,""  Mr  Beasy  said.   ""I  believe  this  is  a  very  unfair  basis  for  funding.""  Mr  Beasy  said  the  maximum  funding  for  any  independent  school  was  70  per  cent  of  the  average  government  cost  for  educating  a  student.  ""River  City  Christian  College  receives  only  about  58  per  cent  of  the  funding  provided  per  student  in  a  government  school,""  he  said.  ""Parents  have  to  make  up  the  rest  in  fees.  Staff  make  sacrifices,  but  resourcing  the  school  is  difficult,""  Mr  Beasy  said.  He  described  recent  criticism  in  the  media  about  ""rich""  schools  such  as  Kings  College  and  Geelong  Grammar  as  ""grossly  misleading"".  ""These  schools  receive  less  than  half  the  funding  per  student  of  government  schools.  ""After  150  years  of  existence,  these  schools  have  built  up  signifi-   cant  resources  and  assets  through  sacrifice,  benevolence  and  careful  management.  ""But  this  should  not  prevent  current  families  from  having  some  fee  relief  through  fairer  government  funding.""  Mr  Beasy  said  other  schools  which  had  existed  for  only  a  few  years,  whether  government  or  independent,  could  not  expect  to  have  built  up  the  resources  of  long-established  schools.  ""Independent  schools  should  not  be  penalised  because  of  this,""  he  said.  ""All  students  should  receive  the  same  funding  regardless  of  which  school  they  attend.  ""Taxation  should  be  the  only  leveller  between  high  and  low  socio  economic  groups."" ",2000-11-27
"  Bookshop  celebrates   AN  Ecumenical  Thanksgiving  Service  to  celebrate  10  years  of  the  Oasis  Christian  Bookshop,  known  as  God's  Gifts  &amp;  Gear,  was  held  in  the  Cummins  Institute  on  Sunday,  August  20  at  11am.  Over  100  people  from  all  religious  denominations  within  the  town,  including  Anglican,  Catholic,  Christian  Outreach  Centre,  Uniting  and  Lutheran  churches  attended  the  thanksgiving  service,  which  was  followed  by  a  pooled  luncheon  and  shared  fellowship  with  each  other.  Chris  Kenny  accompanied  by  Dave  Pearson  on  guitar,  sang  a  bracket  of  hymns  to  get  the  service  under  way.  Reverend  Mark  White,  Uniting  Church  Minister,  welcomed  all  who  had  gathered  for  the  thanksgiving  service,  giving  special  mention  to  Father  Robert  Haste,  past  Anglican  Minister  in  Cummins,  and  his  wife,  Rosemary,  who  had  travelled  over  from  Mount  Barker  for  the  10th  birthday  celebrations  of  the  Oasis  Christian  bookshop.  The  opening  prayer  was  read  by  Mark  White,  before  Diane  and  Roy  Modra  (Lutheran)  led  the  singing  of  the  hymn  ""Praise  the  Lord"".  Stephanie  Habner,  COC  Pastoral  Carer,  read  the  first  Reading  which  was  taken  from  Revelations.   Catholics,  Janette  Haarsma,  Jenny  Seeker,  Michelle  Jenkins  and  Liz  Blacker  accompanied  by  Josie  Hammond  on  the  keyboard  led  the  singing  of  the  hymn  ""Come  to  the  Water'.  The  second  Reading,  taking  from  the  Psalms,  was  read  by  Nigel  Habner,  COC  Pastoral  Carer.  Reverend  Lesley  McLean,  Anglican  Minister  read  the  Gospel  for  the  service.  Father  Robert  Haste,  Anglican  Minister  gave  the  sermon.  While  the  offering  was  taken  up  a  hymn  ""This  is  our  Nation,  this  is  our  Land""  was  sung.  Over  $800  was  raised  towards  the  School  Chaplaincy  Fund.  Reverend  Mark  White  offered  the  thanksgiving  prayer  for  the  generosity  of  the  community.  Another  hymn,  ""Shine,  Jesus  Shine""  was  sung  before  Pastor  Brian  Keller,  (Lutheran  Minister)  read  the  final  prayers  of  thanksgiving.  ""Shout  to  the  Lord""  was  the  final  hymn  before  Father  John  Baldacchino  (Catholic  Priest)  gave  the  final  blessing.  Members  of  the  band  who  supplied  the  music  for  the  service  were  Ian  Pearson,  keyboard;  Kingsley  Habner,  trombone;  John  Adams,  guitar;  Eric  Adams,  bass  guitar;  Daniel  Adams,  drums.  Peter  Mickan,  chairman  of  the  Oasis  -  God's  Gifts  and  Gear   expressed  his  thanks  for  all  who  attended  the  service,  and  invited  all  to  share  in  the  pooled  luncheon  and  fellowship.  The  birthday  cake,  celebrating  10  years  in  operation  of  the  Oasis  Christian  Bookshop,  was  cut  by  Barb  Richardson  and  Daphne  Mickan.  Roger  Laube  spoke  of  his  involvement  with  Oasis  -  God's  Gifts  &amp;  Gear,  and  the  interaction  between  the  management,  supporters  and  customers.  Peter  Blacker,  Member  of  Flinders  at  the  time,  opened  the  Christian  bookshop  on  August  17,  1990.  An  outreach  facility  was  eventually  set  up  with  gear  being  sent  to  Elliston,  Kimba  and  Tumby  Bay  from  the  bookshop  in  Cummins.  Diane  Modra  and  Heather  Daniels  related  stories  of  their  involvement  and  that  of  their  mother,  the  late  Ruth  Woolford  with  the  Christian  bookshop.  From  humble  beginnings  of  donated  goods,  to  the  first  stock  take  which  revealed  that  the  bookshop  had  amassed  $20,000  worth  of  stock  and  equipment,  it  proved  that  the  faith  that  the  people  had  in  setting  up  the  bookshop  was  indeed  warranted.  Aileen  Richardson  also  spoke  on  the  bookshop  that  was  supported  by  all  the  different  churches  in  Cummins. ",2000-09-05

"  Messianics   ftlarik  BrisSdn   JEWISH  households  in  the  Melbourne  suburb  of  Caulfield  are   being  targeted  by  Christian  mission  aries  distributing  a  new  book  titled  L’chaim:  Finding  the  Light  of  Shalom:   What  the  Rabbis  Never  Told  You!   The  chairman  of  the  Australian  branch  of  Jews  for  Judaism,  Jeff  Feldman,  has  condemned  the  book  as  “extremely  deceptive”  and  typical  of  missionary  tactics.  “It  doesn’t  come  out  as  being  a  Christian  book,  it  speaks  about  Torah  prophecies  and  the  messianic  era,  but  goes  on  to  say  that  the  Messiah  has  already   been.”   Mr  Feldman  said  it  was  likely  that  missionaries  would  look  for  a  mezuzah  on  the  houses  to  which  the  books  were  delivered.  “They  prey  on  the  fact  that  the  bulk  of  Jews  don’t  know  much  about  their  own  religion.  That  is  the  reason  they  are  never  seen  to  approach  religious  Jews.”   Jews  for  Judaism  are  to  hold  a  three-day  “Survival  Seminar”  in  Melbourne,  designed  to  teach  the  community  how  to  respond  to  mis  sionaries.  Leading  it  will  be  US-based  Jews  for  Judaism  founder  Rabbi  Bentzion  Kravitz  and  education  director  of  the  Toronto  branch  of  Jews  for  Judaism  Rabbi  Michael  Skobac.

Speaking  of  motivational  methods,  it  would  not  surprise  me  to  see  a  coach  one  day  at  the  half  time  break,  march  his  team  into  the  league's  bar,  throw  $50  on  the  counter  and  yell  ""Give  us  a  carton  Greg,  why  wait  'till  the  end  of  the  day  for  the  best  when  you  can  have  it  at  half  time.""

"  Law  ensures  a  place  of   worship  for  all   NGN-Christian  religions  are  free  to  take  over  disused  churches  as  places  of  worship  in  New   South  Wales.   The  state  government  made  the  changes  to  the  law  after  the  NSW  Land  and  Environment  Court  ruled  against  the  Bangladesh  Islamic  Centre  using  a  former  Presbyterian  church  as  a  mosque  in  Bankstown.   The  Centre’s  application  had  been  challenged  by  Bankstown  Council,  which  cited  its  plan  ning  approval  for  the  site  as  per  mitting  only  the  “erection  of  a  brick  church  and  office"".  Justice  Terry  Sheahan  ruled  that  while  a  mosque  is  a  place  of  worship,  it  “is  not  a  church,  which  is  a  place  of  worship  in  the  Christian   tradition”.   Under  the  new  amendments  to  planning  laws,  a  “place  of  worship”  has  been  redefined  to  cover  both  Christian  and  non  Christian  denominations.   While  non-Christian  faiths  “are  pursuing  many  options  for  servicing  their  communities,  the  law  will  now  provide  every  reli  gion  with  the  same  options”,  Minister  for  Urban  Affairs  and  Planning  Dr  Andrew  Refshauge  told  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald.

"  Olympic  missionary  alert   Ma?k  BitbsMsi   AUSTRALIAN  Christian  missionaries  would  be  most  active  during  the  Olympics,  according  to  the  founder  and  US  West  Coast  director  of  the  Jewish  anti-missionary  group  Jews  for   Judaism.   Rabbi  Bentzion  Kravitz,  who  was  in  Sydney  recently,  said  the  pattern  of  missionaries  was  that  they  became  more  active  at  major  public  events  such  as  the  Olympics  because  they  felt  a  need  to  reach  a  wider  audience.  “I  predict  a  lot  more  missionary  activ  ity  of  people  standing  on  street  cor  ners  handing  out  brochures,  perhaps  even  having  concerts  and  lectures  and  trying  to  attract  people.”   According  to  Rabbi  Kravitz,  650  messianic  centres  have  been  set  up  in  the  United  States,  Israel  and  England  to  entice  Jewish  people  to  Christianity.  “The  people  running  those  organisations  don’t  think  they  have  created  a  movement  to  entice  us;  they  think  it  is  a  legitimate  expres  sion  of  their  Jewish  identity.”   Rabbi  Kravitz  said  the  mindset  of  messianic  individuals  is  to  try  to  dis  tance  themselves  from  specifically  Christian  terms.  “It  started  in  the   Rabbi  Bentzlon  Kravftz   1940s  as  Hebrew  Christians,  then  Jewish  Christians,  then  they  dropped  the  word  Christian  and  went  to  Messianic  Jews,  and  now  it’s  Biblical  Jews,”  he  said.   “This  is  an  attempt  to  distance  themselves  from  Christianity  because  that  will  prevent  Jews  from  being  attracted  to  it.  Deep  in  their  soul,  they  are  not  really  comfortable  with  their  history  of  Christianity.”   There  is  a  responsibility  to  edu  cate  people  about  messianic  organisations,  although  the  deci  sion  whether  to  attend  their  activi   ties  rests  with  individuals,  he  said.   Rabbi  Kravitz  said  he  has  no  prob  lem  with  mainstream  Christianity,  but  is  concerned  about  messianic  groups  which  seek  to  portray  an  image  of  legitimacy.  Messianic  groups  adapt  rabbinic  Judaism,  which  they  claim  has  nothing  to  do  with  God,  express  ing  Judaism  as  part  of  their  culture.   “You  can’t  have  your  culture  based  on  rabbinic  Judaism  and  then  totally  deny  what  the  teachings  of  rabbinic  Judaism  have  taught.  What  bothers  us  the  most  about  this  movement  is   that  it’s  ‘kosher  pork’.  It’s  taking  pork,  dressing  it  up  with  a  circle  U  and  say  ing  it’s  a  kosher  product.”   Jews  involved  in  the  messianic  movements  could  return  to  Judaism   through  teshuva  (repentance),  he  said;  however,  while  they  remain  mes  sianics,  their  practices  are  tanta  mount  to  idolatry,  which  has  reper   cussions  for  them.   “Halachically,  a  person  can’t  be  buried  in  a  Jewish  cemetery,  can’t  be  given  an  aliyah  to  the  Torah  and  can   not  be  trusted  for  kashrut.”   Si  Further  information  about  Jews  for  Judaism  can  be  obtained  from  their  website  at  www.jewsforjudaism.org ",2000-03-03

As  a  teenager  he  played  professionally  in  cabaret  ensembles  and  folk  duos,  and  in  the  1980s  he  played  in  the  popular  Adelaide  bush  band  Three  Corner  Jack.  Since  that  time  he  has  released  nine  albums  variously  for  adults  and  children,  the  most  well  known  around  Australia  being  Christmas  In  The  Scrub,  which  places  the  Christmas  story  firmly  in  Australian  culture.

"  Descendants  visit  historic  family  sites   DESCENDANTS  of  early  Sheringa  pioneers  Joseph  and  Anne  Cummings  gathered  at  Port  Lincoln  over  Easter  for  the  family's  second  reunion.  Relatives  travelled  from  Sydney,  Adelaide  and  many  areas  of  South  Australia.  Joseph  and  Annie  Cummings  settled  on  Black  Hill  farm  at  Sheringa  in  1886.  They  raised  a  family  of  four  children,  Josephine  Frances  (married  1/Henry  James  Cook  2/Frederick  Winstanley),  Joseph  Benjamin  (married  1/Emily  Harris  2/Susan  Hall  3/Hilda  Cornish  4/Hettie  Bower),  Leo  (married  Eliza  Rouse)  and  Annie.  Doug  Cummings  was  the  compere  on  the  'history  trip  down  memory  lane'  bus  trip  to  Sheringa  on  Saturday,  April  22  which  was  thoroughly  enjoyed  by  the  40  family  members  on  board  as  well  as  those  who  joined  on  along  the  way.  Many  areas  of  particular  interest  to  the  Cummings  family  were  viewed  and  enjoyed,  with  special  mention  of  the  monument  to  Leo  Cummings  who  drowned  at  'Kiana',  the  cemetery  at  Sheringa  which  was  of  particular  interest  as  most  of  our  family  forebears  are  buried  there.  The  beach  and  Round  Lake  were  also  visited  with  special  memories  shared  of  the  family  outings  often  held  there,  together  with  the  churches,  the  school  site,  the  cricket  pitch,  the  old  Boarding  House  site  as  well  as  other  places  of  interest.  Mike  and  Jenny  Wandell  allowed  family  members  access  to  their  property,  known  as  the  'Lambing  Station'  which  also  played  a  very  significant  part  of  the  Cummings  family's  early  history  in  the  area.  Other  families  chose  to  journey  to  Black  Hill  farm,  to  see  first  hand  the  homestead  ruins  there.  A  visit  to  the  now  Sheringa  Roadhouse  included  some  insight  about  the  site  that  was  once  where  Leo  Cummings  operated  his  General  Store  and  Blacksmith  Shop  and  where  later  the  Post  Office  and  Telephone  Exchange  were  managed  by  Way  and  Phyl  Cummings  and  then  Leona  and  Victor  Hurrell  and  their  families.  On  the  home-ward  trip,  a  stop  was  made  at  the  Nowhere  Else  plaque,  near  where  Annie  and  Joseph  had  lived  in  a  hut  while  shepherding  sheep  on  the  Price  Maurice  run.  Sunday,  April  23  saw  about  160  descendants  issued  with  name  tags,  continue  the  reunion  at  the  Port  Lincoln  Bowling  Clubrooms.  Peg  Cummings  was  the  very  capable  compere  for  the  day,  read-   ing  a  poem  she  had  composed  of  the  early  days  of  the  Cummings  family.  Diane  Beer  and  Jill  Peters  unveiled  and  had  available  for  purchase  the  very  valuable  Cummings  Family  History  Book  update,  continuing  on  from  the  1983  book.  The  commemorative  port  glasses  engraved  with  the  Cummings  family  Coat  of  Arms,  proved  very  popular,  with  there  being  a  possibility  of  more  being  ordered.  Diane  Beer  also  introduced  a  slice  of  history  with  a  member  from  each  branch  of  the  family  reading  a  dramatised  story  of  the  Cummings  clan's  Scottish  origins  and  Joseph's  life  until  he  settled  at  Sheringa.  There  was  a  very  extensive  display  of  both  old  and  new  as  people  brought  along  interesting  items  -  among  them,  poignant  letters  written  during  the  First  World  War  by  Geoffrey  Cummings  to  his  mother  and  grandmother.  Geoffrey  was  killed  in  action.  A  framed  painting  of  the  Cummings  family  Coat-of-Arms,  created  by  Joseph  and  Annie's  great  great  grandson,  Leo  Colbert  was  also  proudly  displayed.  Mike  (Murray)  Cummings  from  Adelaide  at  age  85  years  was  the  oldest  family  member  present  with  Blake  Schumann  aged  only  10  weeks  being  the  youngest.  Mrs  Jo  Edmonds  presented  both  with  a  memorable  certificate,  copies  of  which  were  placed  in  the  capsule.  The  Cummings  Clan  was  emotionally  stirred  when  Diane  Beer,  a  daughter  of  the  well  known  R.M.  (Reg)  Williams,  who  is  a  long  time  friend  of  Slim  Dusty,  played  the  cassette  that  Slim  Dusty  had  taped,  performing  a  poem  written  many  years  ago  by  Joseph  Benjamin  Cummings,  Diane's  grandfather,  which  has  been  titled  'Lady  Luck'.  Mike  Cummings  (a  son  of  Joseph)  has  been  the  custodian  of  that  poem,  plus  many  more  written  by  Joseph,  for  all  these  years.  Diane  Beer  unveiled  the  'Time  Capsule'  into  which  was  placed  many  various  items  of  interest,  including  written  articles,  photos,  a  very  old  kit-bag  and  a  bullet  shell  from  the  First  World  War  which  had  belonged  to  Doug's  father,  Lindsay  Cummings,  all  of  which  will  be  of  great  interest  when  the  Capsule  is  opened  at  the  next  reunion,  planned  for  Easter  2010.  Items  may  continue  to  be  added  as  desired,  by  contacting  Auburn  (Strawb-Snr)  Cummings  who  is  the  keeper  of  the  Capsule.

Rated  MA.  .  If  you  caught  the  30-odd-year-old   original  Shaft  (Roundtree)  on  tele  recently  you'll  be  aware  that  it  wouldn't  take  much  to  improve  on  the.  old  formu  la.  Having  said  that,  however,  the  origi  nal  is  one  of  those  cult  classics  that  is  part  of  the  human  psyche  whether  you  have  seen  it  or  not.  The  theme  is  just  as  widely  known  too,  of  course,  and  its  composer/performer,  Isac  Hayes,  is  well  known  to  South  Park  fans  in  his  almost-  as-cool-as-Shaft  Chef  role.  Samuel  L  was  a  natural  choice  for  .  the  new  Shaft.  I  say  new  Shaft  for,  although  the  name  is  the  same,  the  modern  John  Shaft  is  actually  nephew  to  the  famous  PI  with  attitude.  In  fact,  to  tie  the  two  together,  John  Shaft  Snr  (Roundtree)  actually  plays  Uncle  John,  obviously  doing  well  in  the  PI  business  —  with  the  money  and  the  broads.  Today's  detective  John  Shaft  is  a  policeman  with  attitude  in  pursuit  of  ah  uptown  white  honky  who  murdered  a  coloured  brother  outside  a  restaurant  in  a  fit  of  racially  incited  rage.  With  daddy's  wealth  and  city  influ  ence,  Wade  (Bale)  posts  bail  and  skips  the  country,  two  years  later  returning  straight  into  the  arms  of  the  ever-  vigi  lant  Shaft.   The  judicial  system,  for  which  Shaft  and  the  rest  of  the  force  works,  fails  yet  again  to  hold  up  its  end  of  the  scale,  turning  the  murderer  loose  on  the  city.  Disillusioned  with  the  injustice  of  the  justice  system,  ,  Shaft  (literally)  throws  in  his  badge  to  take  the  bad  guy  down  anyway  he  can.  Free  on  his  own  recognisance,  Wade  sets  about  finding  the  only  eyewitness  capable  of  bringing  him  unstuck.  With  the  same  ruthlessness  that  got  him  in  trouble  in  the  first  place,  he  hires  a  small  army  of  crims  and  crooked  cops  to  find  Diane  Palmiari  (Collette)  and  snuff  her  out.  Standing  between  him  and  the  witness,  however,  is  just  one  man  —  John  Shaft.  What  follows  is  a  bloodbath  of  epic  proportions  —  enough  to  satisfy  your  every  bloodlust  if  that's  what  you're  in  to.  I  don't  want  to  give  too  much  away,  but  the  ending  was  one  we  might  all  fantasise  over  if  put  in  the  same  situa  tion.  But,  for  me,  it  was  just  a  little  flat.  Perhaps  there  was  something  deep-and-  meaningful  in  it  for  all  of  us.  Check  out  the  Website  too  —  shaft-'  themovic.com  :  —  I  thought  it  was  pret  ty  cool.

"  New  principal  aims  high   By  ANDREW  SCARCE   The  new  principal  of  River  City  Christian  College  in  Echuca  brings  a  world  of  ""life  experience""  to  the  position.  Alan  Beasy,  originally  from  Mildura,  replaces  Neil  Schroder,  who  had  been  principal  since  the  college's  inception  in  1981.   Aged  49,  Mr  Beasy  is  a  late-comer  to  the  teaching  profession,  having  completed  his  training  only  recently.   He  and  wife  Judith,  also  a  teacher  at  the  Rose  St  college,  have  four  children.  ""All  I've  learnt  over  my  life  in  relation  to  business  and  people,  raising  kids,  dealing  with  kids  in  youth  clubs,  music...  all  those  types  of  things  —  and  being  involved  in  the  conventions  of  this  school-type  over  the  years  —  have  given  my  wife  and  myself  expertise  in  its  (the  college's)  methodology.  ""I  teach  just  under  three-quarters  of  a  full  teaching  load  here  and  I'm  the  principal  as  well.  I'm  secondaryqualified,  Judith  is  primary-qualified.""  The  college  has  a  total  enrolment  of  74,  which  is  expected  to  reach  80  this  year.  The  college  was  established  in  1981.  Its  current  site  in  Rose  St  was  once  the  drive-in  theatre.  Mr  Beasy  said  the  school  was  nondenominational  and  was  designed  so  that  people  with  a  Christian  philosophy  could  have  their  children  trained  in  that  world  view.  ""My  aim  is  to  bring  all  the  students  up  to  speed  —  up  to  a  level  of  expectation  that  is  higher  then  they've  had,""  he  said.  ""We  teach  students  in  characterbuilding  and  what  is  their  Godordained  role  in  life.""   •  Alan  Beasy  took  over  from  Neil  Schroder  (inset)  as  principal  of  River  City  Christian  College.

"  Elaine  Nile  retires  citing  victory  in  'War  on  Masturbation'   SYDNEY,  Tuesday  There  were  emotional  displays  and  many  tributes  paid  today  as  Elaine  Nile,  Christian  Democrat  MP  of  12  years  standing,  announced  her  retirement  from  the  Parliament.   Ms  Nile  blamed  smokers  in  Parliament  House,  the  long  hours  demanded  of  politicians  and  her  recent  successes  in  the  Christian  Democrats*  'war  on  masturbation'  as  contributing  to  her  decision  to  quit.  According  to  Nile,  a  recent  Department  of  Education  study  suggests  that  awkward  moments  of  teenage  self-exploration  are  now  as   likely  to  be  expressed  through  Bible  study,  sublimated  tendencies  to  violence  and  the  use  of  self-  flagellation  as  through  the  use  of  'the  poor  man's  Palm  Pilot'.  A  senior  member  of  the  Department  today  described  the  report  as  'definitive,  though  not  in  any  sense  real  ...  we  just  cooked  it  up  to  stop  her  calling  us  every  damn  day'.  'Now  that  we  have  succeeded  in,  stamping  out  the  sin  of  Onan,  we  can,  at  last,  have  some  well-earned  rest,'  Mrs  Nile  told  a  packed  news  conference  full  of  journalists  and  well-wishers.   Mrs  Nile  -ui-J  she  toll  that  her  lime  in  Parliament  had  achieved  main  successes  for  decent  caring  Christians.  She  named  the  increase's  in,  gay  bashings  and  the  continued  need  for  intravenous  drug  users  to  use  dirty  needles  in  children's  parks  rather  than  shooting  galleries  as  the  two  fp*eatest  achievements  of  her  time  in  Parliament.  'Every  time  I  think  of  those  faggots  making  fun  of  m\  husband  during  their  filthy  parade  I  am  calmed,  by  the  knowledge  that  if  they  don't,  get  a  good  bashing  then  at  least  they  will  be  punished  in  hell,'  said  Mile.

"  American  Psyco   Dir  Mary  Harron.  Writ.:  Harron,  Guinevere  Turner,  based  on  the  novel  by  Bret  Easton  Ellis.  Star.:  Christian  Bale,  Willem  Dafoe,  Chloe  Sevigny,  Jared  Leto,  Reese  Witherspoon,  Samantha  Mathis.  What  is  it  about  American  Psycho?  Coming  into  the  screening,  I  overheard  several  people,  especially  women,  say  something  along  the  lines  of  ""I  read  the  book,  and  now  I'm  afraid  to  see  the  movie.""  As  the  drops  of  blood  in  the  film's  playful  opening  were  revealed  to  be  merely  a  raspberry  sauce  garnish  over  some  exotic-looking  dish  m  a  posh  restaurant,  you  could  sense  the  audience  breathing  out  a  collective  sigh  of  relief.  Such  apprehension  on  the  part  of  the  viewer  in  even  approaching  the  film  is  understandable,  given  the  highly  controversial  nature  of  the  source  novel.  Bret  Easton  Ellis'  1  991  Lome  about  murderous  yuppie  Patrick  Bateman,  who  confesses  to  feel  nothing  except  when  he's  killing  and  maiming,  was  a  brilliantly  satirical  jab  at  the  morally  bankrupt  1980's;  however  it  was  widely  vilified  by  the  critics  and  the  public  for  its  graphical  descriptions  of  vicious  acts  of  murder  and  mutilation.  The  fact  that  the  excessive  nature  of  these  acts  was  in  keeping  with  the  gross  excesses  of  the  decade  went  largely  ""  ignored  by  the  critics.  Certainly,  it's  hard  to  appreciate  the  small  subtleties  when  there's  a  sledgehammer  banging  at  your  head.  Director  Mary  Harron  [I  Shot  Andy  Warhol)  does  th«  novel  a  great  service  by  preserving  both  its  satire  and  its  evil  menace  while  largely  ditching  the  graphical  violence.  Those  who  feared  the  film  would  be  an  offensive  slasher  flick  can  relax.  For  American  Psycho  is  a  much  classier  affair  than  anyone  could  have  imagined.  The  film  follows  Bateman  (Christian  Bale)  around,  from  his  designer  condo  to  the  business  lunches  with  his  yuppie  friends  to  the  chicest  restaurants  and  clubs,  all  the  while  juggling  a  girlfriend  (Reese  Witherspoon),  a  mistress  (Samantha  Mathis],  a  secretary  (Chloe  Sevigny)  and  several  hookers.  Bateman's  life  is  like  a  constant  game  of  one-upmanship:  When  fellow  worker  Paul  Allen  (Jared  Leto)  raises  his  ire  by  having  both  a  superior  business  card  and  a  reservation  at  the  hottest  restaurant,  he  is  swiftly  marked  for  execution.  Bateman  is  seen  as  yuppie  caricature  that   obsesses  over  his  skin-cleansing  routine  and  finds  profundity  in  the  music  of  Phil  Collins  and  Huey  Lewis.  The  character  is  a  blank,  a  non-entity,  whose  only  recognisable  emotions  are  greed,  lust  and  envy.  Indeed,  his  vanity  and  materialist  fetishism  for  wellknown  brand  names,  typical  of  the  national  greed  that  ran  rampant  during  the  late  80's  period  of  economic  boom,  is  almost  as  horrifying  as  the  violent  crimes  he  commits.  Despite  being  the  center  of  the  movie,  Harron  clearly  sees  him  and  the  other  males  he  associates  with  as  ridiculous,  misogynist  jokes,  while  the  female  characters  are  seen  to  be  much  smarter  and  more  identifiably  human.  Bateman's  violent  acts  are  wisely  kept  mainly  offscreen  -  the  violence  quotient  of  the  film  is  considerably  less  than  that  of  most  mainstream  blockbusters.  Instead,  Harron  lets  the  little  details  -  such  as  a  clump  of  hair  removed  from  a  victim  -  reveal  the  depths  of  his  depravity.  Only  near  the  end  is  one  horrifying  act  fully  shown.  Elsewhere,  she  brings  the  comedy  and  the  satire  to  the  fore,  taking  numerous  digs  at  the  excesses  of  the  era.  She  is  ably  assisted  by  Christian  Bale,  who  gives  a  weird  and  scarily  effective  performance.  He  manages  to  make  Bateman  both  a  repellent  monster  and  a  strangely  sympathetic  one,  as  he  conveys  the  character's  inability  to  control  his  demonic  urges.  The  other  standout  performance  is  by  Chloe  Sevigny,  who  is  deeply  touching  as  the  iovestruck  secretary  in  peril.  Some  people  will  surely  cry  foul  of  the  film,  lamenting  the  toned-down  violence  and  say  that  Harron  is  missing  the  point.  I  think  that's  only  true  if  you  view  American  Psycho  as  a  slasher  story.  In  my  opinion,  what  she  has  done  is  reveal  the  substance  beneath  the  surface,  and  in  so  doing  has  turned  a  repellent  novel  into  one  of  the  classiest  movies  of  the  year.

"  Interview  with  a  Lead  Games  Designer   Today  I  am  with  Christian  Vanover,  who  is  part  of  the  design  team  of  a  new  variation  of  the  award  winning  Might  and  Magic  Series  called  Legends  of  Might  and  Magic.  Christian  is  here  to  talk  a  little  about  the  game  and  what  his  job  entails.  1.  How  did  you  get  started  in  the  designing  of  computer  games?  In  1995  I  started  working  at  New  World  Computing  as  the  Network  Administrator.  Since  maintaining  a  network  for  just  23  employees  was  usually  pretty  quiet,  I'd  spend  any  free  time  helping  out  with  whatever  cur-  rent  game  was  being  made.  The  first  game  I  had  any  real  contribution  to  was  the  original  Heroes  of  Might  and  Magic,  for  which  I  made  several  maps.  2.  What  was  your  first  game  that  you  designed?  Officially,  Legends  is  my  first  design  project.  Prior  to  that  I  was  mostly  doing  level  design  and  background  writing  to  help  flesh  out  what  the  designers  had  already  created.  I  have  made  maps/levels  for  Heroes  I,  II,  and  III  and  Might  and  Magic  VI.  3.  Do  you  think  there  are  better  jobs  for  pro-  grammers  and  designers  of  computer  games  available  now?  It  always  seems  like  everybody  wants  to  be  a  game  designer.  J  However,  without  talented  programmers  our  designs  are  nothing  more  than  a  collection  of  ideas.   4.  The  Might  &amp;  Magic  series    started  out  as  a  role  playing    game  and  has  branched  into    other  genre,  from  strategy  with  Heroes  of  MM  and  an  arcade  adventure  with  Crusaders  of  MM.  How  would  you  best  describe  LOMM?  I   As  with  Heroes  and  Crusaders,  Legends  will  break  new  ground  by  taking  the  Might  and  Magic  franchise  into  the  realm  of  internet  multiplayer  action.  5.  Can  you  give  readers  an  insight  into  the  new  game,  the  story  and  concept  and  objective?  The  focus  of  Legends  is  on  team-based  multiplayer  action  within  the  Might  and  Magic  universe.  Players  will  choose  to  stand  with  the  forces  of  Good  or  ally  with  the  forces  of  Evil,  squaring  off  against  each  other  to  complete  specific  goals  which  can  either  be  in  direct  opposition  (where  one  team  has  something  the  other  wants)  or  can  be  a  race  to  complete  the  same  goal  (such  as  both  teams  searching  for  a  powerful  artifact],  6.  How  are  the  death  matches  unique  from  other  on-line  games  that  are  available?  Legends  has  evolved  quite  a  bit  over  the  course  of  its  development.  As  I  mentioned,  the  focus  is  now  completely  on  multiplayer,  though  an  Offline  Mode  will  allow  players  some  practice  time  to  avoid  what  I'm  sure  has  happened  to  everybody  -  jumping  into  an  online  game  and  getting  killed  while  trying  to   figure  out  what  a  neat-looking  item  does.  J  However,  the  game  is  not  a  traditional  deathmatch.  Each  scenario  will  have  specific  objectives,  from  rescuing  a  captured  princess  to  recovering  an  ancient  and  powerful  sword  to  slaying  a  near-invincible  dragon.  Each  round  that  your  team  wins  will  bring  you  additional  wealth  and  power,  but  death  means  the  loss  of  everything  you  have  gained  except  whatever  meager  savings  you  have  stashed  away.  You  must  wait  for  the  round  to  end  before  you  can  rejoin   your  team,  unlike  traditional  deathmatch  games  where  you  simply  respawn  when  you  get  killed.  7.  Can  you  tell  us  a  little  about  the  single  player  games?  Each  of  the  game's  scenarios  are  standalone  events,  most  taking  place  in  famous  locations  or  recreating  epic  battles  from  the  rich  history  of  the  Might  and  Magic  universe,  with  the  remainder  set  in  new  lands  that  may  or  may  not  hint  at  events  to  come.  8.  With  the  increase  market  for  internet  games,  do  you  think  that  the  MM  series  was  forced  to  include  an  on-line  series  in  order  for  the  series  as  a  whole  to  survive?  For  example  the  fact  that  Origin  no  longer  makes  a  single  player  RPG  for  Ultima  instead  devoting  all  its  resources  to  develop  Ultima  Online.   Not  at  all.  The  fact  that  online  games  are  becoming  a  huge  success  allows  all  of  us  to  do  what  we  always  wanted  -  play  our  favorite  types  of  games  on  the  computer  with  friends  -  so  it's  not  that  we  were  forced,  it's  that  we  were  finally  given  the  opportunity.  That  doesn't  mean  single-player  gaming  is  dead  -  for  example,  even  though  Heroes  of  Might  and  Magic  has  a  strong  multiplayer  component,  the  emphasis  is  on  the  single  player  game.  9.  How  does  it  feel  to  be  starting  a  new  series  and  although  you  have  the  backing  of  a  good  name,  you  are  trying  to  generate  excitement  from  fans  of  MM  &amp;  HOMM  and  at  the  same  time,  create  something  different  that  will  draw  new  players  to  the  series  and  possibly  generate  interest  in  the  other  games  in  the  series?  It  is  exciting  and  frightening  at  the  same  time.  The  excitement  comes  from  being  able  to  start  with  a  clean  slate  and  literally  create  something  from  scratch.  Plus  the  fact  that  it  takes  place  in  the  Might  and  Magic  storyline  means  that  the  background  and  general  ""ground  rules""  are  already  well  known,  which  let's  us  focus  on  the  game,  not  making  the  world  for  the  game.   As  for  the  frightening  part,  you  never  know  how  a  new  game  will  be  received.  If  we  were  making  a  sequel  to  an  already-successful  game  we  would  know  what  people  liked,  what  they  didn't,  and  what  we  needed  to  change  to  write  a  ""new  chapter""  to  the  story.  With  a  brand  new  game,  you  don't  have  that  same  sense  of  security.  But  who  knows,  maybe  it's  the  bit  of  fear  that  adds  to  the  excitement!  10.  The  LithTech  engine  will  be  used  for  the  first  time  in  a  MM  game.  How  did  you  find  working  with  this  engine?  Starting  with  an  already-developed  engine  is  like  starting  with  an  already-developed  universe  -  it  let's  you  focus  on  the  gameplay,  not  on  the  engine.  The  LithTech  engine  allows  us  to  finally  bring  Might  and  Magic  to  a  true3D  environment,  which  is  something  that  would  have  taken  2-3  years  of  development  had  we   elected  to  create  a  new  engine  in-house.  11.  What  ideas  or  techniques  that  you  learned  from  developing  the  Heroes  series  did  you  apply  to  the  Legends  series   In  all  honesty,  I  played  a  very  minor  role  in  developing  the  Heroes  series.  Even  Heroes  Ill's  design  was  complete  by  the  time  I  joined  the  team,  and  I  was  primarily  put  in  charge  of  Level  Design.  However,  there  are  a  lot  of  talented  people  here  that  I  can  learn  from,  and  apply  that  to  Legends.  12.  With  the  release  of  LOMM  soon,  what  comes  next?  Any  plans  for  the  future?  Too  early  to  tell.  Right  now  the  team  is  focused  on  Legends.  For  me  at  least,  I'll  worry  about  what's  next  after  we're  done.  Beyond  the  Legends  development  team,  however,  things  are  really  busy  at  New  World  Computing.  Work  has  begun  on  Heroes  IV,  and  we  have  some  interesting  things  planned  for  the  PlayStation  2,  which  is  exciting.  13.  That's  all  the  questions  I  have  unless  you  have  something  else  to  add?  Be  sure  to  visit  the  3D0  website  (www.3do.com)  in  the  coming  months.  Not  only  is  there  info  available  on  all  our  products,  but  Legends  info  will  start  appearing  there  soon.  While  you're  there,  stop  by  the  3D0  Community  and  take  part  in  the  discussions  that  are  going  on  there.   ?   -  Nathan  Paris ",2000-10-03
"  Opinion   writ.:  Michael  Shane   Shaft   Dir.:  John  Singleton.  Writ.:  John  Singleton  [screenplay),  Ernest  Tidyman  (novel).  Star.:  Samuel  L.  Jackson,  Vanessa  L.  Williams,  Jeffrey  Wright,  Christian  Bale,  Toni  Collette,  Busta  Rhymes  and  Richard  Roundtree  as  Uncle  John  Shaft.  In  1971  Gordon  Park,  the  first  black  director  on  a  'studio'  production,  made  the  film  Shaft.  While  the  sound  track  by  Isaac  Hayes  bagged  an  Academy  Award,  the  film  hardly  rates  a  mention  today,  unless,  of  course,  your  looking  at  it  from  a  racial  perspective.  Unfortunately  the  director  of  the  Shaft  remake,  John  Singleton  (whose  last  noteworthy  effort  was  Boyz  N  the  Hood,  his  other  recent  works  include  Higher  Learning,  Poetic  Justice  and  Rosewood),  has  backed  this  up  with  a  patchy,  uncontroversial,  ultimately  unmemorable  effort.  That  said  there  is  something  unmistakably  cool  about  both  productions.  In  short  the  Shaft  remake  has  attempted  to  gloss  up  the  original  for  mass  consumption  and  the  new  sheen  works  to  both  compliment  and  detract  from  the  film.  First  of  all,  Samuel  L.  Jackson  is  S-h-a-f-t  ...  Well,  that  is  to  say  he's  Shaft  v2.  Or  is  it  to  say  that  he's  just  Samuel  L.  Jackson  in  type-cast  performance  number  b538  [that's  'b'  for  bad-ass]?  Don't  get  me  wrong,  Samuel  L.  Jackson  is  the  man.  Yet  in  Shaft  he  merely  resubmits  a  readymade  awarding  wining  performance;  that  is  to  say  he  is  the  engaging  and  enigmatic  bad-ass  as  ever  he  was  in  countless  films  before  now.  It  is  unfortunate  that  his  many  similar  performances  weigh  on  the  mind  and  detract  from  his  full  import  and  effort  as  he  fails  to  distinguish  his  work  in  this  film.  Nonetheless,  as  Richard  Kuipers  sums,  while  Shaft  is  ""no  classic  of  any  genre,  Samuel  L's  overproof  cool  ensures  a  good  time...""  Undeniably,  Jackson  takes  second  place  next  to  praise  worthy  performances  by  co-stars  Christian  Bale  (American  Psycho)  and  Jeffrey  Wright.  In  particular,  African-American  Wright  is  hilarious  as  Peoples  Hernandes,  a  downtown  ethnic  drug  boss,  and  commands  every  scene  he  inhabits.  It  is  worth  the  admission  just  to  see   him  on  the  big  screen.  In  short  however,  the  greatest  criticism  of  the  Shaft  remake,  which  has  been  cited  repeatedly  by  critics,  is  that  it  is  an  empty  Political  Correct  engagement  with  the  original.  The  central  to  the  premise  of  Shaft  is  that  he  is  a  private  dick  who  works  alone  and  would  ""risk  his  neck  for  his  brother  man.""  Yet,  the  remake  largely  ignores  this  choosing  instead  to  present  a  story  permeated  by  a  sorry  excess  of  bland,  mainstream  racial  politicking.  Shaft  is  now  a  NYPD  detective  ""too  black  for  the  uniform,  too  blue  for  the  brothers""  who  quits  to  protest  against  the  system  which  let  a  rich  white  race-killer  free.  Quitting  the  force  is  Shaft's  sole  defining  moment  in  the  remake  and  yet,  it  is  ignored  throughout  the  rest  of  the  film.  New  Shaft  hangs  out  with  his  police  buddies  (who  endlessly  declare  how  much  they  are  risking  to  help)  and  engages  in  a  quest  to  protect  the  sole  (white  female)  witness  (Toni  Collette)  who  can  bring  the  murderer  to  justice.  So  far  away  from  risking  it  for  their  brother  man  Singleton  and  associates  pander  to  the  whim  of  the  masses.  That's  not  Shaft.  As  Sean  Weitner  puts  it,  the  remake  ""proves  the  character  (Shaft)  is  culturally  potent;  I'm  ready  to  see  a  movie  in  which  he  is  culturally  significant  as  well.""  And  again  Kuipers  has  already  said  best,  ""has  filmmaking  become  so  politically  correct  that  today's  exploitation  pictures  eschew  the  elements  which  made  them  great  in  the  first  place?""  Ultimately  though  the  remake  is  in  fact  'cooler'  than  the  original  and  for  the  most  part  I'm  sure  the  average  film-goer  couldn't  care  less  about  anything  else.  And  why  should  they?  The  film  is  a  lot  of  fun,  if  arguably  shallow.

"  arms   Title:   America’s  Real  War   Author:  Rabbi  Daniel  Lapin   Publisher:  Multnomah,  $36.95   Reviewer  Mark  Braham   THIS  book  is  a  call  to  arms,  addressed  in   particular  to  American  Jews,  but  also  to  all  people  who  “share  the  same  moral  vision”  of  a  society  based  on  Judeo-Christian  principles.  That,  claims  Rabbi  Daniel  Lapin,  is  the  foundation  on  which  America  was  found  ed.  This  is  not  the  same  as  a  state  having  an  established  Church.  But  nor  does  it  mean,  Lapin  says,  that  the  state  must  be  secular;  for  that  “leads  to  secular  humanism,  atheism,  socialism,  and  Communism”.   In  a  methodical  manner  over  52  chapters,  the  author  explores  and  dissects  the  Jewish  American  scene.  Even  shorn  of  the  book’s  powerful  message,  with  its  ominous  warning,  the  work  is  a  masterpiece  of  reporting.   This  comes  as  no  surprise  to  observers  of  the  American  scene  familiar  with  the  work  of  Dennis  Prager  and  Michael  Medved,  who,  together  with  Lapin,  comprise  a  trio  of  brilliant  and  erudite  reporters  —  all  promoting  the  mes  sage  to  Americans:  return  to  the  Judeo  Christian  fundamentals  or  perish.  Interestingly,  too,  while  Lapin  and  Medved  are  strictly  in  the  Orthodox  tradition,  Prager  is  not.  In  this  battle,  says  Lapin,  just  as  we  must  join  forces  with  the  Christians,  so  must  we  co-operate  with  the  non-Orthodox  who  recognise  the  problem.   Lapin  warns  that  Jewish  liberals—so  promi  nent  among  the  anti-religious  forces  working  to  undermine  the  foundations  of  the  world’s  greatest  nation,  whose  national  ethic  stemmed  from  Jewish  teachings  —  are  playing  a  dispro  portionate  role  in  the  corruption  of  the  society  that  has  provided  them  with  opportunities  and  advancement  never  before  equalled  in  Jewish  history.  Moreover,  in  the  process,  they  are  con  tinually  backing  anti-Israel  forces.   The  author  states:  “If  America’s  liberal  Jews  had  to  choose  between  a  conservative  America  that  genuinely  guaranteed  safety  and  security  for  Israel  and  a  secular  liberal  America  that  threw  Israel  to  the  wolves,  Israel  would  lose.  If  the  deal  offered  to  American  Jews  was  to  become  pro-life  in  exchange  for  Israel’s  sur  vival,  the  answer  would  be  a  resounding  ‘no  way’.”   Jewish  liberals,  who  dominate  the  American  Jewish  scene,  “have  tried  to  equate  Judaism  with  liberalism;  this  means  affirmative  action  [in]  welfare,  prohibition  of  prayers  in  the  schools,  no  private  school  vouchers,  abortion   rights  and  rights  of  homosexuals”.  Lapin  sug  gests  that  in  the  political  context  such  people  should  be  referred  to  as  “circumcised  liberals  rather  than...  Jews”.   He  quotes  a  Los  Angeles  Jewish  Federation  employee  as  maintaining  that  those  who  opposed  the  liberals’  stand  on  school  vouch  ers,  including  Lapin  himself,  Prager  and  Medved,  were  “not  really  Jewish”.  Lapin  responds:  “So,  to  an  employee  of  the  Los  Angeles  Jewish  Federation,  a  body  charged  with  representing  about  half  a  million  Jews,  voting  with  the  liberal  establishment  was  more   significant  than  keeping  kosher,  observing  the  Sabbath,  praying  in  tefillin,  and  teaching   Torah.”   Although  written  about  the  American  scene,  America’s  Real  War  is  of  inestimable  value  in  assessing  problems  facing  major  Jewish  com  munities  in  cdl  democracies.  It  is  not  only  a  fas  cinating  sociological  study.

"  manpHeiBy   NEW  YORK:  Dozens  of  rabbis  and  Jewish  scholars,  saying  that  “Christianity  has  changed  dramatical  ly”,  have  issued  a  broad  treatise  on  Christianity  and  interfaith  relations,  stressing  that  Jews  and  Christians  worship  the  same  God  and  that  Nazism  was  not  a  “Christian  phenom   enon”.   The  statement,  called  “Dabru  Emet”  (“Speak  Truth”),  was  signed  by  more  than  160  Orthodox,  Conservative  and  Reform  rabbis  and  published  in  an  advertisement  in  the  New  York  Times.   Since  the  Holocaust,  the  treatise  said,  “Christianity  has  changed  dra  matically.  An  increasing  number  of  official  Church  bodies,  both  Roman  Catholic  and  Protestant,  have  made  public  statements  of  their  remorse  about  Christian  mistreatment  of  Jews  and  Judaism.  We  believe  these  changes  merit  a  thoughtful  Jewish  response.  Speaking  only  for  ourselves  —  an  interdenominational  group  of  Jewish  scholars  —  we  believe  it  is  time  for  Jews  to  learn  about  the  efforts  of  Christians  to  honour  Judaism.  We  believe  it  is  time  for  Jews  to  reflect  on  what  Judaism  may  now  say  about  Christianity.”   The  statement  was  written  by  four  Jewish  theologians  and  released  by  the  Institute  for  Christian  and  Jewish  Studies  in  Baltimore.   “It  is  historic,”  said  Eugene  Fisher,  director  of  ecumenical  and  inter-reli  gious  affairs  of  the  National  Conference  of  Catholic  Bishops.  The  mainstream  churches,  he  said,  are   “changing  their  attitudes,  doctrine,  theology  toward  Jews  and  Judaism.  This  is  a  document  that  takes  that  into  account.”   “Jews  need  to  leam  what  forms  of  Christianity  are  friendly  and  merit  support,  and  to  acknowledge  that  there  are  those  in  Christian  world  who  have  devoted  themselves  to  interfaith  issues  and  taken  risks  to  combat  Christian  antisemitism,”  said  Rabbi  David  Sandmel  of  the  Baltimore  insti  tute.  In  the  Jewish  world,  there  is  “an  ignorance  of  Christianity,  a  tendency  to  view  the  Christian  world  as  mono   lithic  and  a  tendency  to  view  all  Christians  as  antisemites  and  or  as  Nazis.  That  is  part  of  the  motivation  behind  this  —  to  encourage  Jews  to  take  a  deeper  look  at  the  Christian   world.”   The  treatise  was  written  by  Dr  Michael  Signer  of  the  University  of  Notre  Dame,  Dr  Tikva  Fryer-Kensky  of  the  University  of  Chicago  Divinity  School,  Dr  Peter  Ochs  of  the  University  of  Virginia  and  Dr  David  Novak  of  the  University  of  Toronto.   The  signatories  of  “Dabru  Emet”  include  Irving  Greenberg,  an  Orthodox  rabbi  and  chairman  of  the  US  Holocaust  Memorial  Council;  Neil  Gillman,  a  Professor  of  Philosophy  at  the  Jewish  Theological  Seminary;  and  heads  of  the  Conservative,  Reform  and  Reconstructionist  movements.   The  statement  covers  overlapping  layers  of  theological,  historical  and  political  ground.  It  said  that  Jews  and  Christians  worship  the  same  God.   “While  Christian  worship  is  not  a  viable  religious  choice  for  Jews,  as   Jewish  theologians  we  rejoice  that,  through  Christianity,  hundreds  of  mil  lions  of  people  have  entered  into  rela  tionship  with  the  God  of  Israel,”  the   statement  said.   Another  aspect  says  that  Christians  can  respect  the  claim  of  the  Jewish  people  to  the  Land  of  Israel.  “As  mem  bers  of  a  biblically-based  religion,  Christians  appreciate  that  Israel  was  promised  —  and  given  —  to  Jews  as  the  physical  centre  of  the  covenant  between  them  and  God,”  the  state  ment  said.  “Many  Christians  support  the  State  of  Israel  for  reasons  far  more  profound  than  mere  politics.  As  Jews,  we  applaud  this  support.  We  also  recognise  that  Jewish  tradition  man  dates  justice  for  all  non-Jews  who  reside  in  a  Jewish  State.”   Several  dozen  academics  and  rab  bis  declined  to  sign  the  statement,  objecting  to  specific  aspects  of  the  treatise,  not  to  its  overall  purpose,  said  Sandmel,  a  Reform  rabbi.  For  instance,  some  felt  the  “Nazism  was  not  a  Christian  phenomenon  “state  ment  was  too  strong,  while  others  felt  it  was  not  strong  enough.  Without  the  long  history  of  Christian  anti-Judaism  and  Christian  violence  against  Jews,  Nazi  ideology  could  not  have  taken  hold,  nor  could  it  have  been  carried  out.  Too  many  Christians  participated  in,  or  were  sympathetic  to,  Nazi  atrocities  against  Jews.  Other  Christians  did  not  protest  sufficiently  against  these   atrocities.  But  Nazism  itself  was  not  an  inevitable  outcome  of   Christianity,”  Sandmel  said.

"  Money  scandal  unjustly  implicates  German  Jews   BERLIN:  German  Jewish  leaders  here  are  in  an  uproar  over  a  false  report  involving  Holocaust  survivors  in  the  money-launder  ing  scandal  that  has  rocked  the  leadership  of  Germany’s  leading  conservative  party.   The  resulting  scandal,  which  saw  former  German  Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl  resign  last  week  as  chairman  of  the  Christian  Democrat  Union,  has  been  described  as  the  worst  in  Germany’s  post-war  history.   In  the  latest  twist,  a  former  Christian  Democratic  Party  leader  from  the  western  state  of  Hesse  said  a  secret  account  set  up  in  the  1980s  in  Switzerland  included  mil  lions  of  dollars  bequeathed  to  the  party  by  “grateful  Holocaust  survivors”.   Only  hours  after  he  had  vigorously  defended  his  story,  former  party  Treasurer  Casimir  Wittgenstein  admitted  that  he  had  “lied  to  help  the  party”.   The  story  set  off  alarms  among  German  Jewish  leaders.  The  statement  is  not  only  false,  but  “the  biggest  scandal  in  this  scan  dal”,  said  Michel  Friedman,  a  vice-president  of  the  Central  Council  of  Jews  in  Germany  and  a  member  of  the  Christian  Democrats.   A  Frankfurt  attorney,  he  called  it  “unbeliev  able  and  irresponsible”  to  add  “such  a  story”  to  the  “disastrous  criminal  act.  Telling  the  public  that  this  is  money”  given  by  Holocaust  survivors  to  the  Christian  Democrats  is  “the  worst  thing  that  has  happened  in  this  story.”   Friedman,  who  said  an  apology  from  Hesse  Governor  Roland  Koch  was  in  order,  has  called  for  action  against  the  former  head  of  the  state  of  Hesse,  Manfred  Kanther,  and  the  83-year-old  Wittgenstein,  who  in  the  1980s  allegedly  transferred  millions  of  money  into  foreign  accounts  and  later  with  drew  it  secretly.   Also  lashing  out  at  the  party,  Salomon  Korn,  president  of  the  Jewish  community  of  Frankfurt,  told  Radio  Free  Berlin  that  the  words  “Jewish  money”  had  been  used  not  by  accident,  but  because  of  “old  preju   dices”.   A  day  later,  the  head  of  the  Christian  Democrats,  Wolfgang  Schaeuble,  apolo  gised  to  Germany’s  Jewish  community  on  behalf  of  his  party.   Friedman  later  said  that  he  and  Paul  Spiegel,  the  newly-elected  leader  of  the  nation’s  Jewish  community,  felt  Schaeuble’s  apology  was  “better  late  than  never”.  But  he  said  this  did  not  erase  the  shocking  fact  that  such  imagery  could  be  used  by  a  top  party  member  as  an  excuse  for  money  laundering.   Chancellor  Gerhard  Schroeder  and  other  leading  members  of  the  Social  Democratic  Party  have  been  calling  for  a  revote  in  last  year’s  state  election  in  Hesse,  which  the  Christian  Democrats  won.  An  investigation  into  possible  fraud  in  Hesse  was  opened   last  week.  Along  with  Wittgenstein,  the  investigation  concerns  tax  adviser  Horst  Weyrauch,  who  allegedly  played  a  role  in  private  party  accounts  connected  with  for  mer  Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl.   Kohl  has  been  under  investigation  since  last  month,  when  he  admitted  having   r   received  as  much  as  $US1  million  in  unre  ported  campaign  funds  during  his  16  years  in  power.  Schaeuble,  Kohl’s  successor  as  party  head,  also  admitted  taking  undeclared  campaign  donations.   JU\ ",2000-01-28
"  Church  and  State   IS  it  time  for  Jews  to  support  separa  tion  of  Church  and  State?  Two  actions  show  Prime  Minister  John  Howard’s  opposition  to  a  multicultural  Australia.   One  is  his  outsourcing  of  employ  ment  functions  to  Christian  churches.  Since  most  churches  do  not  have  expe  rience  in  this  area,  they  hire  consult  ants  who  know  the  business.  This  will  probably  cost  more  than  a  government  employment  service  or  contracting  the  function  to  agencies.  It  also  leads  to  conflict-of-interest  questions  in  church  es  hiring  personnel  and  finding  jobs  for  others.  Can  they  be  blind  to  religious  differences?  Would  people  not  belong  ing  to  the  denomination  feel  comfort  able  working  for  a  sectarian  agency?   From  considerations  of  finance,  effi  ciency  and  social  justice,  Mr  Howard’s   action  makes  no  sense.  This  is  subsidi  sation  of  Christian  churches  to  give  them  an  advantage  over  other  religions  and  power  in  areas  where  they  are  not  involved.  This  seems  also  an  attempt   to  secure  a  proportion  of  the  vote  for  the  Coalition.  Political  parties  have  in  the  past  been  associated  with  various  churches,  but  this  seems  more  blatant  then  anything  in  the  recent  past.   Another  worrisome  action  is  Australia’s  vote  in  the  UN  Assembly  concerning  designation  of  the  Buddhists’  holiest  day  as  a  holiday  for  the  UN  Headquarters.  The  resolution  was  passed.  The  US  was  co-sponsor;  Australia  abstained.  This  is  a  slap-in   the-face  for  Buddhist  Australians.   In  the  US  there  is  an  organisation  called  Protestants  and  Other  Americans  for  Separation  of  Church  and  State.  It  opposes  government  aid  to  churches,  including  subsidies  to  church  schools.  This  allows  the  churches  freedom  of  action  to  criticise  the  government  and  limits  government  influence  on  the  churches.  Some  Jews  support  this  organisation.   In  the  last  elections,  Mr  Howard’s  promise  of  an  increased  subsidy  for  the  Catholic  schools  may  have  fore  stalled  a  pastoral  letter  against  the  GST  as  a  regressive  tax.  If  there  had  been  separation  of  Church  and  State,  we  would  probably  not  have  a  GST.   Jewish  schools  get  a  subsidy  from  the  government.  In  light  of  the  actions  of  the  government  in  outsourcing  employment  functions  to  the  Christian  churches,  insulting  the  Buddhist  com  munity  and  subsidising  the  Catholic  schools  to  get  a  GST,  perhaps  we  lose  more  than  the  subsidies  are  worth.   We  live  in  a  fragmented  society  in  which  the  percentage  of  graduates  from  state  schools  who  go  on  to  terti  ary  education  is  much  less  than  the  percentage  of  graduates  from  religious  schools  who  do,  where  Christian  churches  take  on  what  should  be  pri  vate  or  governmental  functions,  and  where  those  who  are  neither  Jewish  nor  Christian  have  a  greater  sense  of  alienation.  A  greater  separation  of  Church  and  State  would  produce  a  fair  er  society.   Should  Jews  join  like-minded  people  in  other  communities  to  work  for  sepa  ration  of  Church  and  State  in  Australia?   M  D  Fisher   Cashmere,  Qld ",2000-06-30

"  ?   PACE  32  Pecker  burns  Tasmans   MALLEE  Park  with  quick  legs,  quick  hands  and  quick  movement  of  the  ball  were  in  control  for  most  of  the  day  against  Tasmans  in  Port  Lincoln  football  on  Saturday.  There  was  a  period  of  counterpunch  and  it  happened  in  the  third  quarter  for  about  15  minutes  when  Tasmans  through  sheer  determination  and  Zac  Christian's  efforts  showed  they  could  play  footy  and  kicked  two  goals  five  points.  The  five  points  were  all  set  shots.  Two  points  by  Scott  Mosely  and  three  by  new  player  Joshua  Neylon,  with  goals  to  Dion  Branson  and  leader  Zak  Christian  ended  Tasmans  best  efforts  and  Mallee  Park  took  over  again  to  run  away  with  the  game.  Mallee  Park  kicked  against  a  three  goal  breeze  from  the  start  and  absolutely  dominated  with  quick  silver  Michael  Hooker  putting  away  two  goals.  More  goals  were  earned  by  promising  Barry  Johncock  Junior,  two  goals,  with   one  each  to  Eddie  Betts  aild  Burgoyne  to  see  Mallee  Park's  total  at  six  goals,  two  points  to  Tasmans  three  points.  One  of  the  best  passages  of  play,  involved  Hooker  who  was  prepared  to  look  for  the  ball  well  forward  of  centre  half  forward.  Hooker  grabbed  an  uncontested  mark,  turned  Tasmans  inside  out,  and  was  spot  on  with  a  well-weighted  kick  to  a  leading  Johncock  running  deep  in  the  pocket,  who  then  cleverly  found  Eddie  Betts  in  a  paddock  all  on  his  own,  who  made  no  mistake.  Andrew  Woolford  was  doing  well  in  the  centre  with  five  kicks  and  a  clever  handball,  and  Dion  Branson  a  lone  hand  up  forward  had  two  kicks,  two  marks  and  was  finding  his  touch,  Andy  Rowett  was  in  the  thick  of  play  with  two  marks,  three  handballs  and  Daniel  Roach  had  six  handballs  one  mark.  This  kept  Mallee  Park  in  check  to  some  degree,  but  it  was  just  a  quick,  quick,  quick  Mallee  Park  and  Tasmans  were  in  for  a  hard,  hard,  hard  day.   At  half-time  Mallee  Park  had  scooted  away  to  11  goals,  five  points  to  Tasmans  seven  points.  Without  Zak  Christian  this  lead  would  have  been  much  more.  Coach  Richard  Jones  was  putting  his  stamp  of  authority  on  the  game  and  Tasman  coach  Ron  Simpson  had  to  sacrifice  on  bailer  Barney  Nicholls  to  tag  Jones  and  this  did  have  some  effect  to  disrupt  the  Peckers'  quick  movement  of  the  ball,  and  set  up  Tasmans  for  a  surge  in  the  third  term.  Tasmans  went  into  the  forward  50  zone,  15  times  to  Mallee  Park's  eight,  to  kick  only  two  goals  to  Mallee  Park's  four.  Such  was  the  strength  of  the  Mallee  Park  defence  that  Tasmans  had  gone  forward  eight  times  to  register  their  first  goal  for  the  game.  However  the  Hooker  -  Johncock  Jun.  show  didn't  muck  around  and  goaled  at  the  siren  to  see  Mallee  Park  increase  their  lead  to  15-8  to  Tasman  2-14  with  one  goal  each  to  Dion  Branson  and  the  leader  of  the  Tasman  pack  Zak  Christian.

Tasmans  responded  with  two  very  good  goals  when  new  player  Joshua  Neylon  presented  himself.  Neylon  could  be  a  good  forward  option  for  the  Roosters,  he  played  in  the  back  half  for  the  first  two  quarters  and  went  forward  after  half  time  for  five   marks  to  kick  2-3.

"  Making  the  right  choice   Making  the  right  choice  of  school  can  be  a  challenging  responsibility  for  parents.  All  parents  want  a  safe  and  caring  environment  where  their  children  are  given  the  best  possible  education.  The  difficulty  is  that  that  most  schools  claim  to  do  this  so  what  is  the  difference  another.  River  City  Christian  College  does  claim  to  be  different.  RCCC  offers  a  managed,  personalised  education  by  means  of  its  controlled,  motivated,  programmed  leaning  methodology.  This  methodology  is  a  person-  alised  program  which  begins  with  a  diagnosis  of  each  student.  Each  student  is  then  placed  on  a  program  at  his/her  own  level,  and  set  to  work  at  his/her  own  rate.  A  system  of  goals  and  con-  trols  linked  to  rewards  and  penalties  is  used  to  motivate  each  student  toward  greater  achievement,  success  and  prog-  ress.   Successful  learning  results  from  managed  learning.  Teachers  must  know  how  students  are  progressing,  what  difficulties  they  have,  and  be  there  to  encourage  and  help.  Mastery  before  advancing  is  a  key  to  the  program  at  RCCC.  Students  do  no  advance  until  they  have  thoroughly  mastered  the  skills  and  concepts  set  to  be  learned.  The  school  has  a  strong  behavioral  management  policy  coupled  with  high  expectations  of  students.  This  goes  hand  in  hand  with  the  Biblical  instructions  to  par-  ents  to  train  their  children  to  lead  a  life  of  discipline  and  obedience  toward  God.  ""Christian""  growth  is  the  foundational  philosophy  for  all  that  happens  at  RCCFC.  Their  aim  is  to  inspire  each  student  to  follow  Jesus  Christ,  to  realise  God's  particular  purpose  for  their  lives  and  to  be  equipped  to  fulfill  that  purpose.  The  Christian  home,  the  local   church  and  the  school  share  one  united  voice  in  education  and  living.  Thus,  students  are  secure  and  not  confused  by  competing  world  views  and  competing  claims  for  their  moral,  social  and  spiritual  allegiance.  Students  are  continually  in-  spired  to  apply  various  character  objectives  in  their  daily  walk  —  appreciation,  contentment,  com-  mitment,  equity,  optimism,  mercy,  sincerity,  diligence  and  etc.  A  RCCC  goal  is  free-standing  Christian  young  people  whose  faith  and  trust  is  centred  on  Jesus  Christ  and  God's  Word  —  who  are  not  easily  overcome  but  are,  rather,  overcomers.  RCCC  aims  to  stimulate  the  vision  of  every  student  to  visual-  ise  a  wide  variety  of  useful  things  they  can  do  with  their  lives.  Academically,  socially  and  spiritually,  RCCC  is  the  right  choice  in  preparing  students  for  life  in  the  ""real""  real  world.   •  Hannah  Amery,  left,  and  Bethany  Bowles,  with  teacher  Mrs  K  McArdle.

"  Feature   The  December  dilemma   Chanukah  and   Christmas  pose  annual  problems  for   intermarried  couples.  Julie  Wiener  explores   the  December  dilemma.   RABBI  Mark  Levin  planned  to   attend  a  ritual  circumcision  this  holiday  season  just  a  few  feet  away  from  a  Christmas  tree.   The  Reform  rabbi  didn’t  know  about  the  decorated  evergreen  until  the  baby’s  mother,  who  is  Jewish,  and  one  of  his  congregants  called  to  make  the  arrangements  and  mentioned  the  tree  as  an  afterthought.   Levin,  the  spiritual  leader  of  Congregation  Beth  Torah  in  Overland  Park,  said  he’ll  still  go  to  the  ceremony.  But  it  doesn’t  make  him  happy  to  see  a  Jewish  child  grow  up  with  a  Christian  symbol  in  the  living  room.   “Clearly,  I  don’t  agree  that  people  ought  to  have  Christmas  trees  in  their  homes,”  he  said.  “On  the  other  hand,  I  do  agree  that  people  have  autonomous  rights  to  do  in  their  homes  as  they  please.”   With  abundant  commercials,  carols  and  “holiday  specials”  crowding  the  airwaves,  and  bright  red  and  green  decorations  adorning  most  neighbourhoods,  Jews  can  scarcely  ignore  Christmas.  Many  complain  of  the  “December  dilemma”,  the  feeling  that  Chanukah  is  overshadowed  by  the  holiday  commemorating  Jesus’s  birth.   But  for  Jews  married  to  Christians,  December  creates  a  different  dilemma:  it  is  the  time  of  year  when  the  cultural  differences  between  husband  and  wife  are  most  evident.   Even  in  interfaith  families  where  the  children  are  being  raised  solely  as  Jews,  the  Christian  spouse  often  wants  to  have  a  Christmas  tree.   For  many  Christians,  and  even  those  who  have  converted  to  Judaism,  the  tree  is  simply  a  nostalgic  symbol  of  family  togetherness.   “I  will  have  people  say,  ‘Don’t  make  me  give  up  my  tree  —  I  couldn’t  care  less  about  Christian  theology,  but  it  reminds  me  of  a  fun  time  in  my  childhood’,”  said  Levin.   Ellen  Morgan,  a  Catholic  married  to  a  Jew,  Sheldon  Zenner,  in  Evanston,  Illinois,  said,  “Non  Christians  tend  to  view  the  tree  as  something  religious,  much  more  than  Christians  do”.   Trees  have  “nothing  to  do  with  my  Catholic  upbringing,”  she  said,  adding,  “for  someone  raised  a  devout  Christian,  Christmas  is  a  Nativity  scene”.   As  for  the  Jewish  partner,  while  some  “are  delighted  to  have  a  tree  in  their  house  —  it’s  something  they  have  always  wanted,”  a  lot  “can’t  stomach  it,”  observed  Rabbi  Sandra  Cohen  of  Temple  Micah,  a  Reform  synagogue  in  Denver.   For  some,  the  failure  to  stomach  the  tree  stems  from  having  an  explicitly  Christian  symbol,  while  others  worry  about  being  embarrassed  when  their  Jewish  friends  and  family  visit.   In  a  column  in  the  current  issue  of  the  Internet  magazine  interfaithfamily.com,  Marlena  Thompson  of  Northern  Virginia  writes  about  her  angst  over  whether  or  not  to  allow  her  Episcopal  husband  to  bring  a  Christmas  tree   Although  Bio  (right)  and  Nat  Zenner,  sons  of  a  US  Catholic  mother  and  Jewish   father,  are  raised  Jewish,  the  family  often  buys  a  Christmas  tree.  Photo:  jta   into  the  house.  Initially,  she  writes,  it  was  “out  of  the  question”.   “According  to  my  logic  at  that  time,  it  wasn’t  nearly  as  culturally  disloyal  to  marry  someone  who   wasn’t  Jewish  as  it  was  to  have  a   Christmas  tree,”  Thompson  writes.   Families  deal  with  the  issue  in  different  ways.   Thompson  ignored  the  pleas  of  her  husband  and  daughter  for  a  tree   until  her  husband  had  a  stroke  four   years  ago.  Moved  by  his  nostalgia  for  Christmas,  Thompson  relented,  writing,  “1  had  for  too  long  been  selfish  in  my  stance  against  the  tree”.   For  years,  Morgan’s  family  also  avoided  a  Christmas  tree  in  the  house,  a  decision  eased  by  the  fact  that  they  visit  her  relatives  for  Christmas  each  year.  Most  Decembers,  they  also  spend  a  weekend  with  friends  at  a  Wisconsin  farmhouse,  where  they  do  “Christmasy  things,”  like  sledding,  cutting  down  a  fir  tree  and  decorating  it.   “The  tree  becomes  the   ‘Here  is  my  nod’.  We're  not  going  to  do  church,  baptise   the  kids  or  any  of  that,  but  we’ll  have  a  tree.”   But  11  winters  ago,  their  eldest  son  —  then  four  —  asked  his  father  if  he  could  bring  home  a  tree.  His  father  said,  “We’ll  cut  one  down  that  is  just  your  size”.  That  has  become  a  family  tradition,  although  if  they  don’t  go  to  Wisconsin,  they  do  not  go  out  and  buy  a  tree.   Morgan’s  husband  is  “comfortable  having  a  tree  in  the  house  given  how  the  tradition  developed,”  said  Morgan,  noting  that  the  tree  has  become  a  symbol  of  the  family  weekends  with  friends,  rather   than  of  Christmas.   “His  mother,  who’s  a  Holocaust  survivor  and  very  observant,  is  not  at  all  offended  by  it,”  said  Morgan.   REGINA  Woontner,  one  of   Cohen’s  congregants  in  Denver,  said  her  family  has  avoided  Christmas-time  conflict  because  —  although  she’s  a  “generic  Protestant”  and  the  family  visits  her  sister  for  Christmas  —  she  doesn’t  want  a  Christmas  tree  at  home.   “I  want  to  give  my  kids  a  Jewish  education.  How  can  you  do  that  if   you  have  all  this  Christian  stuff  in  the  house?”  she  asked.  But  the  family  is  atypical,  she  said,  noting  that  many  of  their  fellow  congregants  do  have  trees  and  “rationalise  it  as  not  really  a  Christian  thing”   Sometimes  the  Jewish  partner  feels  guilty  asking  his  or  her  spouse  to  give  up  the  cherished  symbol.   Cohen  knows  of  a  family  in  which  the  children  are  being  raised  Jewish,  even  though  the  mother  is  Christian.  “The  father  said,  ‘She  does  so  much,  she  brings  the  kids  to  synagogue,  she’s  willing  to  raise  the  kids  Jewish.  How  can  I  deny  her  this  one  thing?’”  said  Cohen.   “The  tree  becomes  the  ‘Here  is  my  nod’,”  said  Cohen.  “We’re  not  going  to  do  church,  baptise  the  kids  or  any  of  that,  but  we’ll  have  a  tree.”   Traditional  rabbis  —  who  speak  out  strongly  against  intermarriage  —  generally  do  not  have  any  dealings   with  Christmas  trees.  But  in  the  Reform  world,  where  congregations  have  actively  reached  out  to  interfaith  families,  rabbis  have  a  range  of  attitudes  toward  trees  in  their  congregants’  homes.   Levin  and  Cohen  say  Christmas  trees  are  more  Christian  and  more  confusing  to  children  being  raised  Jewish  than  most  interfaith  couples  would  like  to  admit.   People  think  that  “because  they’re  calling  it  a  secular  symbol  it  is  in  fact  that,  but  our  culture  has  a  great  deal  to  determine  what  it  means,”  said  Levin.   “In  American  culture,  it’s  a  quasi  religious  symbol,  and  how  children  will  read  that  is  not  entirely  the  parents’  determination,”  he  added.   Cohen  said,  “At  its  heart,  Christmas  is  a  religious  holiday  —  it’s  about  God  coming  to  earth  as  a  human  being.  I  think  it’s  better  for  children  to  know  which  community  they  are  part  of,”  said  Cohen.  “But  on  the  other  hand,  I  don’t  think  having  a  Christmas  tree  means  you  can’t  walk  into  my  synagogue.  It  means  you’re  on  a  path  and  have  to  figure  this  out.”   Like  the  upcoming  circumcision  Levin  will  attend,  Cohen  once  showed  up  to  do  an  in-home  baby  naming  ceremony,  only  to  discover  that  the  family  expected  her  to  do  it  right  in  front  of  their  Christmas  tree.   She  insisted  on  moving  the  ceremony  to  a  different  room.   “I  was  out  of  seminary  six  months,  and  it  didn’t  occur  to  me  to  ask  about  whether  there  would  be  a  tree,”  recalled  Cohen.  “I  didn’t  feel  I  needed  to  say  I  can’t  give  your  child  a  Hebrew  name  because  of  this,  but  I  also  didn’t  feel  like  I  had  to  do  it  in   that  room.

"  The  wandering  Jew   ASK  THE  RABBI   Rabbi  Raymond  Apple   THERE  is  a  plant  which  bears  the  name  Wan  o  dering  Jew  because  it  is  has  a  tendency  to   spread.  The  name  was  probably  given  with  out  conscious  antisemitic  malice.  There  is  also  a  bird  called  Wandering  Jew,  and  even  a  card  game  and  a  game  of  dice.  However,  in  Christian  legend  there  is  certainly  a  mythical  figure  called  the  Wandering  Jew  who  embod  ies  anti-Jewish  animus.  The  underlying  notion  is  that  the  Jews  are  destined  to  wan  der  and  be  reviled  because  they  rejected   Jesus.   Not  until  the  13th  century  did  it  become  a  clearly  antisemitic  legend,  often  linked  with  the  tradition  that  an  officer  of  the  high  priesthood  struck  Jesus  on  the  way  to  the  ‘'""cross  and  Jesus  condemned  him  to  suffer   punishment  until  the  so-called  second  com  ing.  (“You  will  go  on  forever  until  I  return”  is  what  Jesus  is  said  to  have  told  him.)  The  Wandering  Jew  is  said  to  be  called  Aha  suerus,  the  same  name  as  the  Persian  king  in  the  story  of  Mordechai  and  Esther.   Centuries  of  anti-Jewish  prejudice  inex  orably  conditioned  Christian  communities  to  see  the  Jew  as  a  pathetic  sinner  doomed  by  his  rejection  of  Jesus.  The  Wandering  Jew  vwas  given  different  names  in  different  ver  sions  of  the  story  and  became  the  central  character  in  a  sheaf  of  poems,  novels  and  artistic  and  musical  works,  though  the  tragedy  of  the  Holocaust  has  largely  dis  credited  the  notion.  However,  some  funda  mentalist  Christian  circles  who  hang  on  to  the  story  find  it  hard  to  come  to  terms  with  the  vitality,  dignity  and  creativity  of  the  Jew  ish  people  and  the  vibrancy  of  the  State  of   Israel.   ■  Reprinted  from  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple’s  V  email  list:  torah@greatsynagogue.org.au.

"  The  Shmooze  on  Friday   A  Jewisii   alternative   A  CHURCH  of  England  bishop  has  singled  out  Judaism  as  a  possible  alternative  to  Christianity.   The  Bishop  of  Oxford,  Reverend  Richard  Harries,  has  suggested  that  people  who  believe  in  God,  but  who  have  dif  ficulty  with  the  Christian  claims  about  Jesus,  might  like  to  embrace  Judaism,  the  Sunday  Telegraph  reports.   “Looking  at  people’s  spiritual  needs,  I  see  a  category  of  people  who  are  natural  monotheists  and  who  simply  cannot  believe  Christian  claims  about  Jesus,  but  who  would  love  to  have  a  spiritu  al  home,”  Bishop  Harries  said.  “While  New  Age  religions  offer  some  spiritual  insights,  Judaism  offers  a  tradition,  a  way  of  believ  ing  and  behaving  that  has  been  tried  and  tested  for  nearly  4000  years.”   Bishop  Harries  says  he  has  no  problem  with  his  own  faith,  but  recognises  that  the  Jewish  people  had  offered  “a  remarkable  wit  ness  to  God”  during  the  Holocaust  and  throughout  the   ages.   “Christianity  is  not  the  only  missionary  religion.  We  live  in  a  pluralistic  and  consumer  society.   I  don’t  see  why  Judaism  shouldn’t  offer  what  it  has.” ",2000-06-30
"  Catholics,  Jews  and  Aborigines   HE  week  just  passed  has  yielded  some  unusual  and  uplifting  sights.  We  saw  the  Pope  at  Yad  Vashem  in  Jerusalem.  We  saw  A.  Aborigines  at  B’nai  B’rith  House  in  Melbourne.  We  saw  peo  ple  where  we  don’t  expect  to  find  them  and  heard  words  focused  on  forgiveness  and  hope,  rather  than  on  past  hurts  and  tragic  his   No  analogy  is  perfect,  and  it  would  be  wrong  to  suggest  that  Aborigines  still  struggling  with  the  legacy  of  colonisation  are  deal  ing  with  the  same  burden  as  Jews  still  coming  the  terms  with  abus  es  of  Christianity.  But  both  of  these  events  are  important  in  the  degree  of  movement  and  understanding  that  they  show.   This  week  we  have  seen  two  very  different  platforms  of  reconcil  iation  and,  despite  their  differences,  the  knowledge  that  both  are  happening  confirms  and  supports  the  process  of  coming  together.  It  gives  us  hope.   Pope  John  Paul  II  has  proved  himself  to  be  a  Pope  genuinely  aware  of,  and  committed,  to  Jewish  issues.  Indeed,  one  of  the  most  heartwarming  stories  to  emerge  from  his  visit  to  Israel  came  from  Holocaust  survivor  Edith  Tzirer,  who  met  him  at  Yad  Vashem.  She  recalled  him  as  a  young  priest  named  Karol  Wojtyla,  who  carried  her  to  safety  in  1945.  To  those  saved  by  him,  the  Pope  deserves  to  be  included  among  the  Righteous  Among  the  Nations  who  are  hon  oured  by  Yad  Vashem.   On  the  other  hand,  some  Jewish  leaders  have  taken  the  view  that  for  all  his  efforts,  the  Pope  did  not  go  far  enough.  Two  weeks  ago,  when  the  Vatican  declared  a  Day  of  Forgiveness  and  apologised  for  the  sins  of  the  Church,  the  Jewish  reaction  was  far  from  welcoming.  Many  were  angered  by  the  refusal  of  the  Vatican  to  refer  specifical  ly  to  the  Holocaust.  In  particular,  many  Jews  feel  the  Vatican  will  not  be  sincere  in  its  apologies  until  it  acknowledges  the  harm  done  by  the  failure  of  Pope  Pius  XII  to  speak  out  against  the  Nazis.  It  was  widely  hoped  that  when  Pope  John  Paul  II  was  at  Yad  Vashem,  he  would  take  the  opportunity  to  apologise  more  directly  for  the  fail  ures  of  the  Church  during  the  Holocaust.  What  did  happen  was  indeed  a  specific  and  sincere  expression  of  regret  for  the  “terrible  tragedy  of  the  Holocaust”,  but  no  reference  to  Pope  Pius  XII.   While  some  Jewish  leaders  cling  to  the  view  that  he  should   have  gone  further,  there  has  been  a  far  more  generous  and  understanding  Jewish  response  to  the  genuine  efforts  of  the  Pope  to  turn  around  centuries  of  Christian-Jewish  tension,  and  elevate  the  image  of  the  Jew  in  the  Church  to  one  of  respect.   Jews  welcomed  the  sincerity  of  the  Pope’s  overtures  and  focused  overwhelmingly  on  the  fact  of  his  presence  at  Yad  Vashem  and  on  the  postive  in  what  he  said.   Jewish  tradition  so  values  the  process  of  penitence  and  forgive  ness  that  the  rabbis  have  said  that  if  one  receives  a  sincere  apolo  gy  and  does  not  accept  it,  it  is  as  if  the  sin  is  lifted  from  the  account  of  the  sinner  and  imposed  on  the  balance  of  the  one  who  refuses  to  accept  the  apology.   There  is  no  question  that  there  is  much  to  forgive.  The  Pope,  in  his  speech  at  Yad  Vashem,  said  that  “only  a  godless  ideology  could  plan  and  carry  out  the  extermination  of  a  whole  people”.  But,  as  the  Jerusalem  Post  commented,  “without  almost  2000  years  of  Christian  antisemitism,  the  Holocaust  would  not  have  been  possi  ble  in  Christian  Europe”.   But  the  Pope  struck  a  chord  when  he  called  for  “a  new  future  in  which  there  will  be  no  more  anti-Jewish  feeling  among  Christians  or  anti-Christian  feeling  among  Jews,  but  rather  the  mutual  respect  required  of  those  who  adore  the  one  Creator”.   His  call  is  welcomed.  The  Jewish  people  stand  today  in  a  position  of  strength,  with  a  homeland  in  Israel  and  an  understanding  of  how  we  can  rise  above  being  history’s  victims  to  stand  free  and  proud  on  the  world  stage.   It  is  right  that  reconciliation  between  Christian  and  Jew  should  be  played  out  at  this  point  in  history  in  the  country  that  is  both  the  Holy  Land  and  the  State  of  Israel.   Christian-Jewish  reconciliation  has  taken  2000  years.  The  dam  age  that  Europeans  did  to  Aborigines  when  they  came  to  Australia  began  just  200  years  ago,  and  continues  still  —  as  the  mandatory  sentencing  debacle  makes  clear.  There  are  still  many  individuals  dealing  with  the  personal  legacy  of  the  Stolen  Children,  of  institu  tionalised  discrimination  and  of  damaged  communities.   We  need  not  ask  ourselves  whether  we  are  personally  to  blame.  It  is  not  important  whether  our  individual  ancestors  were  part  of  the  colonial  process  (most  were  in  European  shtetls,  fighting  their  own  battles).  But  we  are,  to  some  extent,  the  beneficiaries  of  an  abusive  system.  In  becoming  the  great,  refugee-welcoming,  multi  cultural  country  which  Australia  often  is,  this  country  trampled  the  rights  of  the  indigenous  people  and  failed  many  times  to  put  that  right.   As  citizens  of  Australia,  as  well  as  Jews  who  know  what  it  is  to  be  forged  in  the  crucible  of  history,  we  have  a  responsibility  to  recon   ciliation.   tories. ",2000-03-31

"  Patrol  boat  recognition   As  part  of  the  RAN  restructuring  a  new  senior  naval  position  has  been  created  at  Darwin  Naval  Base  to  command  the  newly-formed  Patrol  Boat  Group.   RAN  patrol  boats  now  form  one  of  seven  new  FEGs  whose  aim  is  to  align  authority,  accountability  and  responsibility.  The  other  six  FEGs  are  surface  combatants,  aviation,  submarines,  amphibious,  mine-  war  fare/clearance  diving,  and  hydrography.  The  creation  of  a  FEG  solely  for  patrol  boats  reflects  the  increasingly  vital  roles  of  Darwin  Naval  Base  and  its  sister  base  at  Cairns,  at  the  importance  of  year-round  patrolling  by  the  Fremantle  class  vessels  and  their  ships'  companies.

"  SPORT   Close  finishes  for  season   Motorcycles   THE  Port  Lincoln  Motorcycle  Club  2000  Enduro  series  was  concluded  on  Saturday,  September  16  at  Mount  Mena  (Farm  Beach).  Overall  positions  for  the  year  were  decided  in  all  classes  with  some  competitors  needing  a  win  to  secure  their  outright  position.  Track  conditions  were  possibly  the  most  demanding  of  all  season.  Due  to  a  lack  of  rain  the  few  weeks  prior  to  the  event  the  track  became  very  sandy  and  dusty  with  some  sections  bringing  several  riders  to  grief,  although  no  one  was  seriously  hurt.  The  track  was  very  tight  with  some  tricky  uphill  and  downhill  sections  across  loose  rocks  with  only  a  few  straights  to  allow  riders  time  to  relax.  Twenty-one  juniors  competed  in  three  classes  and  most  were  thankful  when  the  chequered  flag  came  out.  First  in  the  80cc  was  Dion  Quinn,  closely  followed  by  Ross  Nelligan  and  Jar  din  Trenowden  was  third.  Combined  class  winner  was  Dene  Rodd;  second  was  Douglas  McDonald  and  third  was  Adrian  Beckett.  Junior  125cc  winner  was  Justin  Smith;  followed  by  Rhys  Wright  and  Aaron  Freeman.  Fifty-five  senior  riders  slogged  it  out  for  end  of  year  positions  with  some  very  competitive  racing  in  all  classes.  First  outright  and  open  class  winners  were  Luke  Cunningham  and  Greg  Dixon  who  took  over  the  lead  on  the  second  lap  and  battled  all  day  with  250cc  winners  Derek  Cullen  and  Ben  Craig  until  late   in  the  second  hour  of  the  event.  Early  leaders  Steve  Schubert  and  Trevor  Castley  chased  hard  all  day  and  just  snatched  second  place  outright  from  Cullen  and  Craig  on  the  final  lap.  The  Iron  man  class  has  been  close  all  season  with  Matthew  Christian  and  Troy  Williams  providing  spectators  with  some  close,  exciting  racing  only  being  separated  by  three  points.  Christian  was  just  able  to  hold  off  Williams  on  the  last  lap  and  crossed  the  line  one  bike  length  in  front  to  pinch  overall  victory  for  the  year,  a  great  ride.

"  crazy  freakin'  Christian   Dear  Woroni,  As  a  concerned  Christian  active  in  a  morally  degenerate  campus,  I  am  frequently  confronted  by  the  forces  of  a  promiscuous  society.

"  Christian  school  on  track   EYRE  Peninsula's  first  nondenominational  school  is  on  schedule  to  open  next  year  with  three  applicants  vying  for  the  position  of  principal  even  though  the  school  is  yet  to  be  registered.  Flinders  Association  for  Christian  Education  board  chairman  Darryn  Johnston  said  the  registration  process  was  currently  taking  place  and  as  part  of  that  an  alternative  school  site  must  be  identified  and  approved  by  the  Port  Lincoln  City  Council  before  the  Flinders  Christian  College  can  move  ahead.  While  land  was  purchased  on  Robertson  Road  in  May  for  the  school,  Mr  Johnston  said  the  Salvation  Army  premises  has  also  been  earmarked  as  a  possible  site.  ""It's  only  a  temporary  site  but  of  course  we  hope  we  don't  have  to  use  that,""  he  said.  Plans  for  the  buildings  for  the  Flinders  Christian  College  were  also  in  hand,  Mr  Johnston  said.  ""We're  just  sort  of  at  the  moment  putting  together  exactly  what  our  needs  are  with  the  buildings.''  The  school  is  hoping  to  obtain  two  transportable  buildings  to  house   four  classrooms  that  will  cater  for  students  in  Reception  to  Year  4.  ""We  have  42  enrolments  in  our  first  year  and  then  we've  actually  got  12  for  the  following  year,""  Mr  Johnston  said.  ""Five  years  in  advance  we've  got  enrolments.  ""Each  year  we'll  add  a  year  so  that  by  2005  we'll  be  a  full  primary  school.""  Mr  Johnston  said  support  for  the  school  was  growing.  ""It's  been  great  actually,  the  support.  ""We've  actually  had  a  couple  willing  to  donate  for  our  land  so  that's  been  really  exciting.  ""I  reckon  it's  really  good  because  people  are  so  keen.  ""ItH  actually  be  the  first  nondenominational  school  on  Eyre  Peninsula.  ""It  adds  to  the  choice  of  schooling  within  the  town,  which  is  great  for  parents.""

"  Hundreds  repent  for  Christian  antisemitism   Stefan  Bialoguski   MORE  than  700  Christians  joined  together  recently  in  a  collective  confession  of  “the  crimes  and  injustices  perpetrated  against  the  Jewish  people  through  the  centuries,  for  which  the  Christian  Church  bears  heavy  responsibility”.   The  repentance  service  at  the  University  of  New  South  Wales  moved  many  people  to  tears,  Central  Coast  Kadimah  Jewish  Congregation  member  Rachel  Harris   said.   “Holocaust  survivors  said,  with  tears  in  their  eyes,  that  they  could  not  believe  they  would  live  to  see  such  a  day.  They  were  so  grateful,  and  thanked  everyone,”  she  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.   Part  of  the  service  read:  “For  2000  years  God  has  been  grieving  over   our  attitude  towards  our  elder   brother,  Israel.  By  our  actions  we   have  shown  ourselves  to  be  foes  of   His  word  and  His  redemptive  purposes.  It  was  through  Israel  that  God  revealed  Himself  and  His  commandments  to  mankind.  In  opposing  the  Jewish  people,  we  have  opposed  God.”   The  service  was  organised  by  the  Evangelical  Sisterhood  of  Mary,  a  Protestant  group  founded  in  Germany  in  1947  to  seek  repentance  for  the  country’s  guilt  in  its   treatment  of  Jews.   Spokeswoman  for  the  Sisterhood,  Sister  Uriela,  said  the  service  deliberately  focused  on  sources   Central  Coast  Kadlmah  Jewish  Congregation  member  Rachel  Harris  with  Reverend  Fred  Nile  at  the  repentance  service.   from  the  Tanach  so  as  not  to  alienate  Jewish  participants.  “We   love  our  Jewish  brothers  and  sisters   and  we’re  so  sorry  for  what  happened.”   Addressing  the  service,  Ms  Harris  said  it  had  been  modelled  on  a  three-day  international  conference  of  repentance  organised  by  the  Sisterhood  in  Jerusalem  earlier  this  year.   “The  timing  for  the  service  in  Sydney,”  she  said,  “arose  out  of  an  article  [Great  Synagogue]  Rabbi  [Raymond]  Apple  wrote  in  the   Jewish  News  in  April,  when  he  said  'that  the  Christian  churches  were  silent  on  anti-Jewish  lies’.  The  Sisters  of  Mary  are  not  a  church  ...  I  knew  of  the  wonderful  work  that  they  do  for  all  Jewish  people  and  Israel,  and  it  really  hurt  me  to  think  that  there  was  a  body  of  people  out  there  who  cared  for  us  but  who,  as  Christians,  were  included  in  this  broad  assessment.”   Rabbi  Apple  attended  the  service,  together  with  a  contingent  of  Montefiore  Home  residents  led  by  Rabbi  Yehuda  Cohen,  North  Shore   Temple  Emanuel  Rabbi  Richard  Lampert  and  Rabbi  Allison  Conyer,  NSW  B’nai  B’rith  president  Henry  Krug,  Israel  Consul-General  Ephraim  Ben  Matityahu,  Vice-Consul  Sharon  Bar-Li  Sa’ar  and  representatives  of  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum.   Rabbi  Apple  told  the  service  that  the  Holocaust  was  the  result  of  centuries  of  antisemitic  stereotyping.  Although  it  was  not  a  Christian  act,  it  arose  in  Christian  Europe  so  that  the  Jews  became  “crushed  between  cross  and  swastika”.   But,  he  added,  Christians  and  Jews  were  now  reconciled,  and  the  time  had  come  to  answer  hatred  with  love.   Margaret  Hall,  of  the  Liverpool  Christian  Fellowship,  told  the  service:  “I  have  been  ignorant  of  the  attacks  upon  [Jews]  in  our  own  land,  this  land  to  which  they  have  contributed  greatly.  As  an  individual,  a  Christian  and  an  Australian,  I  want  to  recognise  and  confess  the  sins  of  the  past  and  to  learn  how  to  work  and  pray  for  God’s  blessing  for  His  chosen  people.”   On  behalf  of  the  Jewish  community,  Rabbi  Lampert  received  a  framed  confession  from  Sister  Simone,  head  of  the  Australian  branch  of  the  Evangelical  Sisterhood  of  Mary.  The  original,  which  was  signed  by  more  than  30,000  Christians  around  the  world,  lies  in  the  official  archives  of  the  State  of  Israel. ",2001-11-30
"  Examining  the  Jewish-Christian  relationship   Title:  Constantine’s  Sword:   The  Church  and  the  Jews:  A  History   Author:  James  Carroll   Publisher.  Houghton  Mifflin  Co,   2001,  $22.40  (US),  576pages   Reviewer:  Calev  Ben-David   THE  story  of  how  the  humble  rock  on   which  St  Peter  once  stood  turned  into  the  world  power  known  as  the  Vatican  is  essentially  tied  into  the  Church’s  evolving  attitude  toward  Jews  and  Judaism.   James  Carroll  begins  his  provocative  and  exhaustive  study  of  the  relationship  between  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  and  the  Jewish  people  by  contemplating  the  large  wooden  cross,  more  than  six  metres  high,  erected  by  Polish  Catholics  during  the  1980s  battle  over  a  controversial  Carmelite  nunnery  estab  lished  outside  the  gates  of  Auschwitz.   “What  does  the  cross  of  Jesus  Christ  mean   at  such  a  place?  What  does  it  mean  to  Jews?  What  does  it  mean  to  Christians?  Or  to  Polish  Catholics?  Or  to  those  for  whom  reli  gious  symbols  are  empty?  What  does  the  cross  there  signal  about  our  understanding  of  the  past?  And  what  of  the  future?”   Carroll  is  not  interested  in  easy  answers.   To  even  begin  addressing  such  questions,  he  believes  one  needs  an  understanding  of  what  place  the  symbol  of  the  cross  occupies  in  Christian  theology.  That,  in  turn,  requires  knowing,  at  least  in  broad  strokes,  the  his  torical  development  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  which  more  than  any  other  branch  of  Christianity  puts  the  crucifixion  of  Jesus  as  the  central  event  in  its  belief  structure.   Thus  Constantine’s  Sword,  although  subti  tled  The  Church  and  the  Jews,  is  about  far  more  than  even  that  tremendous  subject.  At  times,  as  Carroll  relates  the  story  of  the  ide  ological,  political  and  personal  struggles  that  have  rent  the  Church  over  the  centuries,  the  Jews  disappear  from  this  narrative  for  pages  at  a  stretch.  But  as  Carroll  rightly  argues,  the  story  of  how  the  rock  on  which  St  Peter  stood  turned  into  the  Vatican  is  essentially  tied  into  the  Church’s  evolving  attitude  toward  Jews  and  Judaism  over  two  millen   nI  As  the  child  of  a  devout  American-Catholic   family,  who  studied  under  the  Jesuits  at  Georgetown  University  and  spent  six  years  as  a  priest  before  hanging  up  his  robes  to  become  a  novelist  (whose  books  bear  com   parison  with  the  Catholic  pop-fiction  of  the  better-known  writer-priest,  Father  Andrew  Greeley),  Carroll  is  uniquely  positioned  to  deliver  a  work  on  this  subject  that  is  both  academically  sound  and  easily  accessible  to  the  average  reader.   What’s  more,  whenever  possible,  he  deftly  weaves  into  this  book  the  personal  story  of  his  autobiographical  search  for  faith  and  meaning  —  starting  with  his  first  exposure  to  antisemitism,  when  he  was  disappointed  to  learn  that  his  childhood  Jewish  friend  would  not  be  able  to  play  at  the  restricted  Virginia  country  club  to  which  his  family  belonged.   Carroll  starts  his  historical  survey  by  examining  the  New  Testament,  which,  like  many  modern  liberal  Christian  scholars,  he  sees  as  reaffirming  the  essential  Jewishness  of  Jesus  that  both  Christians  and  Jews  have  so  strongly  sought  to  deny.  He  points  out  that  the  theological  conflicts  between  the  earliest  Christians  and  their  Jewish  brethren  were  in  fact  no  worse  than  those  between  Jews  themselves.  He  comes  to  the  defence  of  Saint  Paul,  who,  he  argues  “so  often  identi  fied  as  a  culprit  in  the  Jewish-Christian  con  flict,  was  in  fact  a  victim  of  it.  So  many  of  the  later  phases  of  the  Christian  assault  on  Jews  would  be  carried  out  in  his  name,  yet  in  this   first  phase,  he  saw  that  dynamic  taking  shape  and  tried  to  stop  it.”   The  real  turning-point  in  Christian-Jewish  relations  comes  when  Roman  Emperor  Constantine  is  converted  to  Christianity  in  the  fourth  century  and  makes  that  faith  the  official  religion  of  his  empire.  This  conjoining  of  religious  faith  with  temporal  power  (the  “sword”  of  the  book’s  title)  would  prove,  in  Carroll’s  view,  problematic  for  both  Christians  and  Jews,  often  fatally  so  for  the  latter.  Compounding  the  problem  was  Constantine’s  initiation  of  the  development  of  the  Nicene  Creed,  which  elevated  the  cru  cifixion  of  Jesus  (including  the  alleged  Jewish  complicity  in  that  act)  as  the  central  event  in  the  Church’s  theology  of  redemp  tion.  “Can  it  be  a  coincidence,”  asks  Carroll,  “that  attacks  on  Jews,  both  rhetorical  and  physical,  become  a  notable  pattern  of  Christian  behaviour  only  after  the  cult  of  the  cross  is  established?”   In  388  CE,  a  Christian  mob  in  Milan  burned  down  a  synagogue  —  an  act  defended  by  the  local  bishop,  Saint  Ambrose,  who  declared  a  Jewish  house  of  worship  “a  haunt  of  infidels,  a  home  of  the  impious,  a  hiding  place  of  mad  men,  under  the  damnation  of  God  himself”.   But  Carroll  notes  that  other  Church  fathers  took  a  more  complex,  merciful  view  of  the  Jews.  Although  St  Augustine  wrote  that  “the  Lord  Christ  distinguished  between  His  faithful  ones  and  His  Jewish  enemies,  as  between  Light  and  Darkness”,  this  hugely  influential  early  Christian  philosophy  argued  against  anti-Jewish  violence,  if  only  because  they  deserved  continued  existence  as  “wit  nesses  to  the  prophecies  which  were  given  beforehand  concerning  Christ.”   Alas,  as  this  book  sadly  recounts  in  dis  heartening  detail,  Augustine’s  words  were  too  often  disregarded  by  later  Church  lead  ers  and  lay  Catholics,  especially  during  the  Crusades  when  entire  Jewish  communities  in  Europe  were  massacred  by  rampaging  holy   warriors.   The  problem,  as  Carroll  argues  in  a  chap  ter  aptly  titled  “The  Dainger  of  Ambivalence”,  rests  with  the  mixed  message  sent  out  by  the  Church  leadership  over  the  centuries  —  occasionally  condemning  specific  acts  of  anti-Jewish  violence,  while  still  preaching  “the  dominant  Christian  theology  of  Jesus,  not  only  as  the  enemy  of  the  Jewish  people,  but  as  the  Son  of  God  who  obliterates  the  integrity  of  all  the  other  ways  to  God  ”   In  the  latter  half  of  Constantine’s  Sword,   Carroll  focuses  on  the  growing  struggle  between  the  tradition-bound  Church  and  the  forces  of  modernism  that  have  swept  through  Europe  in  the  past  few  centuries  —  rationalism,  socialism,  Marxism  and  even  modern  capitalism.  Again,  without  under  standing  these  chapters  of  Church  history,  it  is  impossible  to  make  sense  of  the  paradox  of  the  Vatican’s  current  leader,  the  remark  able  John  Paul  II.   On  the  one  hand,  Carroll  rightly  hails  him  as  the  Pope  who  has  done  more  than  any  of  his  predecessors  to  heal  the  breach  between  Catholics  and  Jews.  On  the  other,  as  a  staunch  defender  of  Church  dogma,  John  Paul  II  has  pushed  for  the  canonisation  of  such  staunch  Vatican  conservatives  as  Pius  IX  and  Pius  XII  —  even  though  the  former  was  a  19th-century  reactionary  who  sanc  tioned  the  kidnapping  of  a  Jewish  child  raised  as  a  Catholic,  and  the  latter  has  been  criticised  for  his  deafening  silence  during  the  Holocaust.  While  John  Paul  II’s  landmark  statement  last  March  decried  “the  behaviour  of  those  who  in  the  course  of  history  have  caused  these  children  of  yours  [Jews]  to  suf  fer”,  Carroll  argues  “it  was  possible  to  hear  that  apology  as  regret  for  behaviour  that  was  inconsistent  with  core  Church  teaching,  instead  of  set  in  motion  by  it”.   What  is  really  needed,  says  the  author,  is  a  Church  declaration  that  “while  Judaism  exists  without  essential  reference  to  Christianity,  the  reverse  is  not  the  case  ...  The  Jews  remain  the  Chosen  People  of  God.  The  Jewish  rejection  of  Jesus  as  the  Son  of  God  is  an  affirmation  of  faith  that  Christians  must  respect.”  And  this  statement  must  be  confirmed  by  nothing  less  than  a  “Vatican  III”  council  that  will  “reorder  the  Church’s  rela  tionship  to  the  ‘troubling  texts’  that  deny  all   of  this.”   Such  an  approach  would  no  doubt  raise  the  hackles  of  Catholic  traditionalists,  and  sounds  unrealistically  utopian,  given  the  Vatican’s  increasingly  conservative  policy  on  Church  dogma.  Still,  that  informed,  commit  ted  (if  somewhat  out  of  the  mainstream)  Catholics  like  Carroll  are  willing  to  press  for  such  change,  holds  out  the  hope  that  one  day  the  Church  will  be  redeemed  from  all  the  suffering  that  its  insistence  on  Christian  redemption  has  inflicted  on  the  Jewish  peo  ple  for  ages.

"  Rosen  to  tackle  Jewish  Christian  problems   INTERNATIONALLY-renowned  interfaith  proponent  Rabbi  David  Rosen  will  focus  on  the  current   problems  being  experienced  by  Jews  throughout  the  world  resulting  from  Christian  misteachings  and  misunderstandings  during  a  visit  to  Sydney.   Rabbi  Rosen  will  deliver  the  B’nai  B’rith  Oration  entitled  “Christians  and  Jews  in  the  New  Millennium”  at  the  Wentworth  Hotel  on  May  13.   The  former  Director  of  the  Anti  Defamation  League’s  Israel  office  and  current  world  president  of  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  has  long  been  a  proponent  of  correcting  the  many  wrong  interpretations  of  religious  teachings  over  the  centuries.  In  addition,  he  has  spoken  out  against  Holocaust  denial  movements  and  in  particular  against  the  untruthful  Arab  propaganda  which  Great  Synagogue  Senior  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  deplored  at  a  Christian  Jewish  Luncheon  Club  meeting  in  Sydney  recently.   Rabbi  Rosen’s  visit  is  being   sponsored  by  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  and  the  B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commission.   Born  and  educated  in  Britain,  his  role  as  Director  of  Interfaith  Relations  of  the  Anti  Defamation   League  in  Israel  included   responsibility  for  its  liaison  with  the  Vatican.  As  a  result,  he  serves  on  the  Permanent  Bilateral  Commission  of  the  State  of  Israel  and  the  Holy  See.  He  is  also  a  member  of  the  International  Jewish  Committee  for  Inter-Religious  Consultations  which  represents  organised  World  Jewry  in  its  relations  with  other  world  religious  bodies.   NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  president  Henry  Mendelson  said  the  visit  would  enable  the  Anti-Defamation  Commission  and  the  Council  to  showcase  the  enormous  contribution  to  interfaith  relations  by  Rabbi  Rosen  throughout  a  distinguished  career  devoted  to  inter-religious  dialogue  and  consultation.   In  addition,  it  would  enable  a  wide  spectrum  of  audiences  to  become  aware  of  the  work  being  done  in  the  interfaith  arena  and  hopefully  to  be  supportive  of  it.   “It  will  undoubtedly  help  to  overcome  the  problems  of  limited  vision  and  knowledge  of  other  faiths  and  their  values.  Much  of  this  limited  knowledge  has  resulted  in  the  prejudices  of  the  past,”  he   said.

"  Christian  attitudes  to  Judaism   NE  of  the  books  on  the  International  Best  Seller  list  in  recent  months  is  The  Red  Tent  by  Anita  Diamante  with  over  a  million  copies  sold  around  Jthe  world.  1  have  just  read  an  ""  interview  with  Diamant  in  a  new   journal  published  by  Jewish  Women  International.  She  had  been  known  for  a  series  of  books  on  various  aspects  of  Jewish  life,  and  The  Red  Tent  is  her  first  attempt  at  a  novel.   The  story  is  a  fictional  portray  al  of  Dinah,  who  is  mentioned  in  passing  in  the  Bible  as  the  daugh  ter  of  Jacob  and  Leah.  Diamant  says  that  those  who  have  read  the  book  respond  to  the  relationship  between  mothers  and  daughters  that  propel  the  story.  “People  j-  have  told  me  that  the  book  has  made  them  pick  up  the  Bible  for  the  first  time  in  25  years,”  she  says.  “Some  are  angry  that  I’ve  taken  liberties  with  the  text.

This  makes  Paul  a  Jew  who  turned  against  his  people,  who  rejected  Judaism  and  claimed  that  God  had  rejected  the  Jews.  This  is  the  widely  accepted  story.  However,  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  based  in  Victoria  questions  whether  it  is  a  correct  reading  of  Paul  in  this  small,  but  significant  new  publica   tion.   Was  he  really,  as  Paul  Johnson  argues  in  his  History  of  Christianity,  “the  first  and  greatest  Christian  per  sonality”,  who  “moved  right  across  the  religious  conspectus,  from  strict  legalism  to  a  complete  repudiation  of  the  law  —  the  first  Christian  to  do  so”?   Johnson  adds  that  “Paul’s  gospel  ...  could  be  seen  to  be  alien  to  tradi  tional  Jewish  thinking  of  any  ten  dency,  even  though  it  contained  Jewish  elements.  For  him  the  com   ing  of  Christ  automatically  ended   the  old  Jewish  law”.   This  makes  Paul  a  former  Jew  now  speaking  of  Judaism  from  with  out,  who  has  become  an  enemy  of  Judaism  and  a  harsh  critic  of  Jewish   law.  Hyam  Maccoby,  however,  does  not  even  concede  that  Paul  was  a  former  Jew.  He  believes  that  Paul,  despite  his  own  claims,  was  not  a  Pharisee,  lacked  an  extensive  knowledge  of  Judaism,  may  not  even  have  been  Jewish,  and  was  probably  “a  Hellenistic  adventurer,  on  the  fringes  of  Judaism”.   Most  scholars  do  not  go  so  far,  but,  like  Marvin  Wilson,  see  in  him  both  continuity  and  discontinuity  with  Judaism.  Paul  himself  some  times  praises  Judaism  and  says  he  delights  in  the  Jewish  law  (Rom.  7:22),  yet  he  also  says  a  change  has  happened  in  his  life  and  he  is  differ  ent  from  “when  I  was  still  a  practis  ing  Jew”  (Gal.  1:13).  This  is  one  of  many  inconsistencies,  which,  added  to  his  love  of  sweeping  statements,  is  a  problem  for  the  student  and   scholar.   Clearly,  he  has  had  a  personal  struggle  about  the  law.  True,  he  quotes  from  it  some  80  times,  but  the  more  he  becomes  a  follower  of  Jesus,  the  more  negative  he  is  towards  the  law.  He  believes  the  commandments  —  whilst  not  in  themselves  sinful  —  have  created  sin:  for  instance,  without  the  law  against  coveting  one  might  never  have  known  what  it  was  to  covet.  He  thinks  Jews  observe  the  law,  not  out  of  love  of  God,  but  for  the  sake  of  a  reward,  to  be  “justified”,  whatever  that  means,  in  the  sight  of  the  Almighty.   Rather  than  Moses  who  brought  the  law  to  Israel,  Paul  prefers  Abraham,  who  “had  faith  in  the  Lord”  —  although  the  verse  about  Abraham’s  faith  probably  refers  to  the  patriarch’s  fidelity,  not  his  faith  in  the  Christian  theological  sense.   Sandmel  says:  “For  Paul,  as  for  other  Greek  Jews  whom  history  records,  Judaism  in  its  usual  form  had  become  inadequate...  The  need  of  the  imperilled  individual  was  not  for  the  symbol  representing  God,  not  for  His  codified  word,  but  for  direct  communion  with  God  Himself”.   Paul  is  an  orator,  not  a  teacher.  He  is  addressing  an  audience.  But  which  audience?  Re-Reading  Paul  asks  us  to  try  to  discern  the  setting  in  which  his  words  are  uttered  and  to  identify  his  audience.  Sometimes  it  is  his  fellow  Jews,  and  if  he  criti  cises  them,  it  is  “in  club”;  he  is  a  fol  lower  of  Jesus,  but  not  an  outsider.   Jewish  scholarship,  of  course,  rejects  his  criticisms  and  takes  issue  with  him  on  many  counts.  It  is  adamant  that  his  own  knowledge  of  Judaism  is  flawed;  not  for  one  moment  can  it  accept  his  claim  that  through  the  Torah  Jews  try  to  bribe  their  way  into  God’s  favour,  nor  agree  that  the  law  is  a  barrier  to   communion  with  the  Divine.   Many  of  Paul’s  other  speeches  and  letters  are  addressed  to  Gentile  audiences.  But  not  all  the  Jesus  groups  of  the  time  agreed  with  him   that  Gentiles  could  become  Christians  without  being  Jewish  first.  The  Judaisers  said  the  way  to  Christianity  had  to  be  through  Judaism  (circumcision,  kashrut,  etc).  But  this  view  was  not  for  Paul,  and  his  negativity  about  circumci  sion  not  only  reassured  Gentiles  apprehensive  about  the  operation,  but  was  also  a  retort  to  the  Judaisers.  He  said  that  if  Gentiles  adopted  some  commandments,  they  had  to  adopt  the  whole  Torah,  and  this  might  not  overcome  the   human  tendency  to  sin.   Maybe  Paul  would  have  been  less  polemical  if  his  view  had  been  accepted  by  his  colleagues.  Possibly  the  parting  of  the  ways  between  Judaism  and  Christianity  was  not  necessarily  something  Paul  expected,  even  though  his  career  facilitated  it.  Nor  would  he  neces  sarily  have  foreseen  the  anti  Judaism  that  became  endemic  in  Christianity.   This  new  publication  is  a  careful  summary  of  scholarship  on  the  sub  ject.  It  insists  that  Paul  and  his  teaching  not  be  used  as  a  stick  with  which  to  beat  Judaism  or  the  Jewish  people.  It  is  an  answer  to  Luther  and  others  whose  eyes  are  blinded  by  centuries  of  misrepresentation  of  Judaism  and  the  demonisation  of  the  Jewish  people.  It  is  a  valuable  contribution  to  scholarship  and  to  inter-religious  understanding.   El  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  is  Senior   Rabbi  at  the  Great  Synagogue. ",2001-05-18

"  Penetrating  the  source  of  Christian  antisemitism   Despite  great  progress  towards  reconciliation  between  Jews  and  Catholics,  religious   leaders  on  both  sides  have  still  not  come  to   grips  with  problematic  passages  in  the  Christian  scriptures,  argue   Leanne  Piggoft  and  Peter  Werfheim.   PERHAPS  it  is  the  gorgeous   autumn  weather,  but  in  recent  days  the  Sydney  air  seems  to  have  crackled  with  the  electricity  of  Jewish-Christian  dialogue.   If  you  were  unaware  of  Rabbi  David  Rosen’s  visit  to  our  fair  city,  you  were  not  paying  attention.  Rabbi  Rosen,  formerly  of  the  B’nai  B’rith  Anti  Defamation  League,  is  the  latest  acquisition  of  the  American  Jewish  Committee,  one  of  the  most  respected  Jewish  organisations  in  the  US.   For  some  years,  he  has  been  one  of  the  spearheads  of  World  Jewry’s  efforts  to  persuade  the  Christian   churches  to  break  with  their  anti   Jewish  teachings  of  the  past  and  to  come  to  terms  with  the  continuing  vitality  and  vibrancy  of  Judaism  and  the  Jewish  people.   Rabbi  Rosen’s  knowledge  of  Judaism,  Christian  theology  and  the  controversies  between  the  two  faiths  is  nothing  short  of  encyclopaedic.  He  has  wisdom  to  match  his  depth  of  knowledge,  a  fine  sense  of  diplomacy  and  highly-developed  persuasive  and  rhetorical  powers.  It  is  little  wonder  that  he  commands  such  respect  not  only  in  the  Jewish  world,  but  from  Christians  also.  When  Rabbi  Rosen  speaks,  the  churches  listen.   Over  the  last  40  years,  the  Catholic  Church  in  particular  has  made  significant  and  sincere  efforts  towards  reconciliation  with  the  Jewish  people.  The  unspeakable  atrocities  of  the  Shoah  profoundly  altered  the  Church’s  perceptions  of  Judaism  and  Jews.  The  Church  itself  had  its  own  undeniable  history  of  anti-Jewish  horrors  —  the  Inquisition,  the  Blood  Libel,  religiously  inspired  pogroms,  forced  conversions,  compulsory  ghetto-isation,  countless  petty  humiliations  and  the  relentless  Church  teachings  of  hatred  and  contempt  for  the  Jewish  people.   The  question  was  the  extent  to  which  this  history  of  antisemitism  had  laid  the  groundwork  for  the  Shoah.  It  is  a  question  which  the  Church  still  has  not  fully  answered.   But  it  has  made  a  beginning  —  in  fact,  more  than  a  beginning.  The  late  and  much  respected  Pope  John  XXIII  initiated  the  process  in  the  early  1960s,  leading  to  the  Vatican’s  publication  of  Nostm  Aetate.   The  Catholic  Church  clearly  and   unambiguously  repudiated  its  earlier  doctrine  that  die  Jewish  people  were  to  be  considered  collectively  and  eternally  guilty  of  the  death  of  Jesus  (the  charge  of  deicide).  Further,  the  Church  affirmed  that  any  of  its  followers  who  lapsed  into  anti-Jewish  behaviour  or  attitudes  were  betraying  the  basic  ethical  teaching  of  the   Christian  faith.   To  ensure  that  these  new  principles  were  reflected,  at  least  to  some  extent,  at  the  grassroots  level  of  Catholic  communities,  the  Church  introduced  changes  to  its  liturgy,  including  alteration  of  the  notorious  prayer  Pro  Perfidis  Judaeis.  (Catholics  still  do,  however,  pray  that  Jews  will  embrace  Jesus  as  their  saviour.)   Since  Nostra  Aetate,  dialogue  between  the  Vatican  and  Jewish  leaders  has  continued  and  relations  between  the  two  faiths  on  the  whole  have  been  cordial.  But  it  was  not  until  the  1990s  that  further  significant  steps  were  taken  by  the  Catholic  Church  along  the  path  of  reconciliation.   Perhaps  Rabbi  Rosen  was   playing  the  diplomat,  but  his  is   a  problematic  apologia  for   those  parts  of  the  scriptures   which  have  provided  the   doctrinal  foundation  for  the   Church’s  persecution  of  Jews.   The  recognition  of  Israel  by  the  Vatican  in  1993  was  one  such  step.  Catholic  Bishops’  Conferences  in  many  countries,  including  Australia,  explicitly  recognised  the  continuing  validity  and  vitality  of  the  covenantal  relationship  between  God  and  the  Jewish  people.  The  Church  rejected  the  old  doctrine  that  Christianity  had  “superseded”  Judaism  as  the  covenantal  faith  (the  doctrine  of  supersessionism).   In  1998,  led  by  Australia’s  Cardinal  Cassidy,  the  Vatican  published  We  Remember  A  Reflection  on  the  Shoah.  This  paper  used  the  Hebrew  word  teshuvah  to  give  expression  to  the  Church’s  sorrow  for  its  past  persecution  of  the  Jews  and  anti   Jewish  teachings.   It  acknowledged  in  a  circumscribed  way  that  centuries  of  antisemitic  polemics  by  the  Church  may  have   contributed  to  some  extent  to  the  climate  that  enabled  Nazi  ideology  to  flourish  in  Europe  in  the  1930s.  But  it  could  not  acknowledge,  as  some  of  the  Catholic  Bishops’  Conferences  had  acknowledged,  the  obvious  nexus  between  the  Church’s  anti-Judaism  and  Nazi  antisemitism.  With  tortured   reasoning,  the  Vatican  sought  to  dissociate  these  two  phenomena  from  each  other.  Obviously,  the  dialogue  has  a  long  way  to  go.   As  Rabbi  Rosen  acknowledged,  even  the  advances  which  the  Catholic  Church  has  made  have  largely  been  confined  to  the  apex  of  the  Church  hierarchy.  They  have  often  not  filtered  down  to  the  parish  level  (and  sometimes  not  even  to  the  bishops)  so  as  to  influence  what  is  taught  in  Catholic  schools  and  the  messages  that  are  preached  from  Catholic  pulpits.  Despite  all  the  Vatican  pronouncements,  antisemitism  remains  deeply  entrenched  in  many  traditional  Catholic  communities,  particularly  in  Europe.   The  persistence  of  antisemitism  in  some  Catholic  communities  is  aided  considerably  by  the  large  body  of  religious  literature  from  some  of  the  Church’s  leading  spokesmen  over  many  centuries  which  contain  explicitly  antisemitic  interpretations  of  particular  passages  in  the  Christian  scriptures.  The  steps  taken  by  the  Church  towards  reconciliation  with  Judaism  and  the  Jewish  people  may  be  said  to  constitute  a  repudiation  of  these  traditional  antisemitic   interpretations,  but  only  in  a  general  way.  They  fall  far  short  of  a  “chapter  and  verse”  refutation.  That  task  still  lies  before  the  Catholic  Church,  and  indeed,  all  the  churches.   Some  of  the  problematic  passages  of  the  Christian  scriptures  are:   El  “If  you  were  Abraham’s  children,  you  would  do  what  Abraham  did,  but  now  you  seek  to  kill  me...  If  God  were  your  father,  you  would  love  me,  for  I  proceeded  and  came  forth  from  God  ...  You  [Jews]  are  of  your  father  the  devil,  and  the  lusts  of  your  father  you  will  do.  He  was  a  murderer  from  the   beginning,  and  did  not  abide  in  the  truth,  because  there  is  no  truth  in  him”.  (John  8:21-44)   H  “What  will  the  Lord  of  the  Vineyard  do?  He  will  come  and  destroy  the  tenants  and  will  give  the  vineyard  to  others”.  (From  the  Parable  of  the  Vineyard  in  Mark  12:1-12  which  explains  how  God  has  disinherited   the  Jews  and  established  a  new  covenant  —  New  Testament  —  with   the  Christians)   H  “[The  Jews]  who  both  killed  the  Lord  Jesus,  and  their  own  Prophets,  and  have  persecuted  us;  and  they  do  not  please  God,  and  are  contrary  to  all  men”.  (I  Thessalonians  2:15  —  a  repetition  of  Haman’s  calumny  against  the  Jews  in  Esther  3:8)   H  “Then  answered  all  the  people,  and  said,  his  blood  be  on  us  and  our  children”.  (Matthew  27:25)   H  ‘The  God  of  our  fathers  raised  up  Jesus,  whom  you  [Jews]  slew  and  hanged  on  a  tree”  (Acts  5:30)   On  this  fundamental  question  concerning  the  Christian  texts,  Rabbi  Rosen  was  uncharacteristically  apologetic  on  the  Church’s  behalf.  He  rejected  any  suggestion  that  the  Christian  texts  are  inherently  antisemitic  and  suggested  that  they  should  be  read  in  historical  context.  He  argued  that  Jesus  and  his  disciples  should  be  seen  as  Jews  engaged  with  other  Jews  in  traditional  debate.   Rabbi  Rosen  drew  an  analogy  with  the  controversies,  heated  but  in  good  faith,  between  different  groups  of  Jews  in  biblical  times  such  as  that  which  is  recorded  in  the  Book  of  Amos.  The  polemical  nature  of  the  debate  between  Jesus  and  other  Jews,   according  to  Rabbi  Rosen,  had  been  misconstrued  by  subsequent  Church  leaders  as  a  repudiation  by  Jesus  of   Jews  and  Judaism.   Perhaps  Rabbi  Rosen  was  playing  the  diplomat,  but  his  is  a  highly  problematic  apologia  for  those  parts  of  the  Christian  scriptures  which  for  centuries  have  provided  the  doctrinal  foundation  for  the  Church’s  persecution  and  hatred  of  Jews.   Firstly,  no  serious  scholar  would  accept  that  any  but  a  handful  of  the   words  attributed  to  Jesus  in  the   scriptures  were  his.  Instead,  they  are  words  attributed  to  him  by  later  writers  to  justify  the  development  of  Christian  theology  independently  of  Jesus’  sayings.  Antisemitism,  based  on  the  change  of  deicide  and  the  doctrine  of  supersessionism,  was  from  the  beginning  an  inherent  part  of  this  theology.   Secondly,  none  of  the  other  instances  cited  by  Rabbi  Rosen  of  polemical  contest  between  different  groups  of  Jews  resulted  in  systematic  and  officially-sanctioned  persecution.   If  true  reconciliation  with  the  Jewish  people  is  to  be  achieved  by  ordinary  Catholics,  the  doctrinal  basis  of  Christian  antisemitism  must  be  addressed.  General  pronouncements  of  principle  by  the  Vatican  are  laudable  but  not  sufficient.  Neither  is  an  attempt  at  “contextualisation”  likely  to  be  embraced  in  Catholic   hearts  and  minds.   Nothing  short  of  an  authoritative  new  exegesis,  passage  by  passage,  of  the  problematic  texts  of  the  Christian  scriptures  will  make  the  necessary  impact.  The  Vatican  is  pre-eminently  in  a  position  to  begin  this  task.   H  Peter  Wertheim  is  the  immediate  past  president  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies.

Victorian  John  Paige,  supported  by  a  breakaway  faction  of  the  Seventh  Day  Adventists,  last  week  placed  copies  of  a  book  deceptively  titled  L’Chayim:  Finding  the  Light  of  Shalom.  What  the  Rabbis  Never  Told  You!  in  postboxes  in  Bondi,  Bellevue  Hill  and  Rose  Bay.   Only  on  the  penultimate  page  of  the  book  does  the  author  reveal  his  affiliation  to  Seventh  Day  Adventism,  writing:  “What  better  Jew  could  you  want  than  a  good   Adventist?”   The  book-drop  prompted  some  Jewish  residents  to  drive  around  and  retrieve  as  many  copies  as  they  could.  One  of  them,  who  collected  about  300,  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News:  “I  and  some  friends  came  out  of  a  shiur  and  found  the  book  outside  the  house.  We  saw  it  outside  other  houses   too,  so  we  split  up  into  different   cars  to  retrieve  them.  There  are  millions  of  non-practising  Christians  whom  they  could  be   reaching  out  to;  why  spend  thousands  of  dollars  trying  to  get   us?”   A  Rose  Bay  recipient  of  the  book  said  she  was  angry  that  the  title  and  the  Hebraicised  script  and  use  of  a  menorah  on  the  cover  created  the  impression  that  it  was  Jewish.  “I’m  outraged,”  she  said.  “They  can’t  put  out  a  book  that  purports  to  be  Jewish.  It’s  deceptive.”   The  man  who  spearheaded  its  distribution  in  Sydney,  Mr  Paige,  told  the  AJN  he  believed  the  book  was  Jewish.  “The  Seventh  Day  Adventist  message  is  a  true   continuation  of  Judaism  with  the  prophecies  fulfilled,”  he  claimed.  “Our  apologies  if  we’ve  given  the  impression  of  some  other  agenda;  we’re  simply  trying  to  get  you  to  find  out  the  truth.""   Declaring  that  some  of  his  best  friends  were  Jews,  he  cited  Melbourne  Rabbi  John  Levi  and  St  Kilda  Congregation  choirmaster  Adrian  Bartak.  Rabbi  Levi  told  the  AJN  he  did  not  know  Mr  Paige;  Mr   Bartak  said  he  had  met  him  several   times.  “It’s  been  pointed  out  to  him  that  this  sort  of  thing  is  unwelcome,  so  I’m  surprised  that  he’s  been  doing  it,”  he  said.  “I’m  very  distressed  by  it.”   The  mainstream  Seventh  Day  Adventist  Church,  which  claims  100,000  members  in  Australia,  is  concerned  that  its  name  has  been  associated  with  the  book.   Sydney  spokesman  Roger  Govender:  “The  Seventh  Day  Adventist  Reform  Movement  has,  I  understand,  350  members  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand.  They  should  stop  circulating  this  book.  We  don’t  align  ourselves  with  its  contents.  We’ve  always  enjoyed  a  good  relationship  with  the  Jewish  community  and  we  want  that  to  continue.”   Jewish  community  representative  Josie  Lacey,  who  sits  with  mainstream  Seventh  Day  Adventists  on  the  NSW  branch  of  the  World  Conference  of  Religion  and  Peace,  agreed  that  the  community’s  relationship  with  the  Church  was  good.   Distributing  the  book  in  Jewish  areas  was  particularly  insensitive  at  a  time  when  the  community  was  being  “targeted  by  other  hostile  elements”,  she  noted.  “The  book  is  misleading  and  offensive.  This  is  not  the  way  to  connect  with  people.  This  is  not  about  friendship  or  goodwill.  This  is  about  trying  to  delegitimise  Judaism.” ",2001-07-06
"  Christian  Zionists  speak  out   MORE  than  100  Christian  Zionists  held  an  “Israel  Awareness  Weekend”  in  Newcastle  recently.   The  Australian  director  of  the  International  Christian  Embassy  Jerusalem,  Bruce  Garbutt,  and  his  wife  Kay  addressed  a  Friday  night  dinner,  as  well  as  seminars  on  the  Saturday.   Special  guest  on  the  Friday  was  local  resi  dent  Lottie  Erder,  a  Holocaust  survivor,  who  lit  Shabbat  candles.   Mr  Garbutt  told  participants  at  the  event  at  the  Hunter  Christian  Community  Church  that  Shabbat  represented  the  love  relation   ship  that  God  has  for  the  Jewish  people,  organiser  Josie  Leslie  said  afterwards.   “He  told  us  that  as  Christians,  we  should  honour  the  Jewish  people  and  understand  their  role  in  God’s  plan  and  purposes,  par  ticularly  in  returning  to  the  Land  of  Israel.  He  said  the  trouble  in  Israel  is  the  result  of  the   war  in  1948,  when  the  invading  Arab  nations  told  the  Arabs  living  in  Mandated  Palestine  to  leave  and  return  when  the  war  was  won.  Well,  they  didn’t  win,  did  they?”   Ms  Leslie  said  the  International  Christian  Embassy  had  raised  funds  which  enabled  thousands  of  Jews  to  go  on  aliyah.

"  Christian  scientists  to  clone  Jesus:   'Sick  and  tired  of  waiting'   WOLLONGONG,  Tuesday:  The  cloning  debate  took  an  unexpected  twist  today,  with  the  announcement  that  a  group  of  Christian  scientists  from  Wollongong  University  intend  to  clone  their  Lord  and  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ.   According  to  Head  Metaphysicist  Brian  Rowling,  ""The  secrets  of  cloning  are  all  a  part  of  God's  great  plan.  Dolly  the  sheep,  or  the  Lamb  of  God,  as  we  like  to  call  her,  was  just  the  first  step  in  a  divine  strategy  to  make  cloning  available  to  human  beings.""  ""And  why  else  would  God  make   cloning  available  to  us,""  Rowling  argues,  ""If  not  to  bring  back  Jesus.  You  can't  tell  me  he  wanted  us  to  wait  another  2,000  years.""  Ethics  group  and  sections  of  the  Christian  community  have  reacted  with  anger  to  the  news,  claiming  that  science  and  God  are  not  such  close  cousins  at  all.  They  cite  instances  such  as  the  atomic  bomb,  chemical  warfare  and  a  number  of  Frankenstein  films  as  evidence  that  science,  and  filmmakers,  ought  to  know  their  limits.  But  Rowling  scoffs  at  such  protests.  ""Science,""  he  claims,  ""is   what  has  allowed  God  to  do  the  things  He's  done.  Do  you  think  it  was  mere  coincidence  that  about  2,000  years  after  the  virgin  birth,  IVF  techniques  suddenly  appeared  on  the  scene?  Can't  you  see  that  the  technology  was  just  shelved  for  long  enough  to  make  the  whole  thing  credible?""  When  pressed  further,  he  even  intimates  that  the  miracles  performed  by  Jesus  were  scientific  masterstrokes.  ""Healing  the  sick?  Penicillin,  my  friends.  A  very  early  batch.  And  all  those  loaves  and  fishes?  Special  genetically   modified,  hormone-fed  battery  fishes.  We've  just  about  caught  up.  Ask  the  people  at  Steggles.""  All  of  which  leads  critics  to  ask,  where  does  it  end?  Sceptics  and  believers  alike  are  asking  themselves  the  same  question:  Could  the  resurrection  itself,  the  cornerstone  of  the  Christian  faith,  have  been  some  sort  of  advanced   scientific  achievement?  Rowling  smiles  wrily  at  the  question,  leans  forward  and  removes  his  monocle.  ""Ever  seen  an  electric  current  passed  through  a  dead  frog?  Legs  twitching  all  over  the  place?  Yep,  the  hardest  thing  was  moving  that  big  bloody  rock.  And  getting  the  stains  out  of  that  shroud."" ",2001-04-12
"  Exploring  prejudice  between  Catholics  and  Protesants   COMEDY-DRAMA  The  Christian  Brothers   PETER  Carroll,  one  of   Australia’s  greatest  actors,  excels  even  himself  as  the  Christian  Brother  teacher  in  Ron  Blair’s  1975  comedy-drama  which  has  been  not  only  revived,  but  revitalised  at  the  Opera  House  Playhouse,  next  door  to  the  Studio,  where  Carroll  had  just  finished  a  season  of  Lush  with  Julie  Anthony.   In  that  show  he  played  multiple  roles,  male  and  female,  in  what  may  well  prove  to  have  been  the  best  comedy  performance  on  a  Sydney  stage  this  year.   “This  is  great  theatre  and  ought  to  be  seen  by  anyone  with  serious  interest  in  the   medium.""   In  The  Christian  Brothers,  he  is  the  only  brother  we  see.  He  is  nominally  teaching  a  class  of  students  (male,  of  course);  and  we  don’t  see  them,  either.   Carroll  therefore  has  the  opportunity  to  score  a  runaway,  standing-ovation  tour  de  force,  and  he  makes  a  right  royal  feast  of  it.   Twenty-four  years  older  than  when  this  reviewer  first  saw  him  perform  the  one-man  play,  he  brings  maturity,  a  more  colourful  palette  and  the  wisdom  as  well  as  extended  skills  of  those  years  at  the  top  of  his  profession.   This  is  a  far  funnier  play  (or  performance)  than  I  remembered;  by  the  same  token,  Carroll  invests  it  with  a  new  layer,  a  more  profoundly  tragic  note.   This  is  not  only  a  vivid,  no  doubt  hugely  exaggerated,  view  of  Christian  Brothers  at  work  in  the  classrooms  of  half-a-century  ago.   It  is  also  a  portrait  of  a  man  in  conflict,  failing  in  his  avowed  intentions,  unable  to  fulfil  his  mission  of  bringing  both  secular  and  religious  teaching  to  his  students  in  a  way  they  may  find  acceptable  and  enriching.   For  many  or  most  non  Catholics,  the  play  has  educational  potential.  It  not  only  shows  the  ugly  face  of  cruelty  and  violence  in  the  classroom,  it  makes  what  may  well  be  a  revelation  to  many  —  the  ingrained,  deep-rooted  antagonism  and  prejudice  between  Roman  Catholic  and  Protestant,  here  in  relatively  tolerant  Australia,  so  far  removed  from  Ireland.   Thus  on  the  blackboard  are  the  chalked  characters  AMDC  and  JMJ.  The  brother  enjoins  the  boys  not  to  inscribe  their  public  examination  papers  with  these  giveaway  Latin  acronyms,  which  in  English  translation  stand  for  “To  the  Greater  Glory  of  God”  and  “Jesus  Mary  and  Joseph”.  He  warns:  “Boys,  some  of  those  examiners  are  terribly  bigoted  people  ...  nothing  frightens  them  more  than  to  see  the  professions  filling  with  Catholics.”  So,  the  acronyms  may  well  result  in  the  Catholic  boys’  being  failed.   With  such  advice,  the  brother  nominally  teaches  his  charges  —  “nominally”  because  in  the  span  of  the  play,  he  imparts  almost  no  formal  learning,  and  is  interrupted  by  bells  ringing  and  supplications  to  the  aforesaid  Mary.   But  the  final  word:  this  is  great  theatre  and  ought  to  be  seen  by  anyone  with  serious  interest  in  the   mpHinm   Poker  isnfson ",2001-10-05

"  Letters  To  The  Editor   Pagan  rig  hts  paraded  on  ops   I  AM  hoping  someone  can  explain  to  me  the  offi  cial  army  policy  concerning  non-Christian  religions;  I  have  read  DI  (A)  PERS  170-2  —  all  two  pages,  of  it  ,  which  contains  no  reference  whatsoever  to  non-Christian   or  pagan  religions.  In  addition,  there  appears  to  be  no  comment  made  in  relation  to  compulsory  attendance  at  church  parades.  ""  Since  our  involvement  with  East  Timor,  church  parades  have  become  increasingly  popular  within  many  units.  ''  '  '  Within  my  own,  I  have  heard  many  soldiers  informed  that  they  will  attend  such  parades.  .  I  can  understand  the  need  to  differentiate  between  sol  diers  who  merely  dislike  church  but,  as  a  soldier  who  dis  tinctly  follows  a  religion  which  does  not  accommodate  the  same  beliefs  as  Christians,  l  am  appalled  that  I  can  still  be  made  to  attend  a  church  parade.  Like  many  other  soldiers,  I  have  questioned  the  atti  tude  of  compulsory  church  parades,  with  an  unsatisfacto  ry  outcome.  To  be  forced,  with  threat  of  disciplinary  action,  to  attend  a  Christian  ceremony  which  defies  my  own  beliefs  seems  to  be  discriminatory.  The  religious  argument  has  fallen  on  deaf  ears  in  every  unit  with  which  I  have  served.  I  am  interested  to  know  if  the  army  has  a  policy  which  can  give  me  the  same  support   as  all  the  mainstream  religions  out  there,  or  if  this  is  yet  another  subject  where  the  military  qualifies  for  legal  dis  crimination.  ,   Name  and  unit  details  provided   Withheld  at  author's  request  Principal  Chaplain  -  Army,  Peter  Woodward  replies:  .  THE  ADF  policy  on  religion  and  spirituality  has  always  been  two-fold.  It  is  a  very  important  part  of  life  and  it  must  be  freely  chosen  by  each  individual.  :  The  DI  quoted  does  not  mention  pagan  religions  but  does  mention  several  non-Christian  religions  and  says  that  every  ""effort  is  to  be  made  to  allow  members  of  any  faith  group  to  practice  their  faith  according  to  their  own  partic  ular  observances.""  I  can  only  guess  that,  in  the  case  of  compulsory  church  parades,  the  enthusiasm  for  the  event  or  the  genuinely  felt  need  for  the  occasion,  resulted  in  those  in  command  expecting  everyone  to  join  in.  :  Chaplains  serve  the  army  community  in  their  relation  ship  with  God  —  the  faith  of  the  individual's  choice.  Anyone  who  has  difficulty  with  the  practise  of  their  chosen  faith  or  in  being  made  to  attend  a  religious  activity  which  conflicts  with  their  beliefs,  should  seek  the  support  of  a  chaplain  who  will  represent  their  cause  to  the  com  mand  chain.

"  Books   MUSINGS   Rabbi  Jeffrey   Cohen   I  WAS  recently  involved  in  a  confer   ence  on  Ageing  and  Disabilities,  organised  by  one  of  the  Christian  churches.   In  preparing  my  paper,  I  returned  to  the  writings  of  Barbara  Myerhoff,  who  published  two  books  (one  was  turned  into  an  Academy  Award-winning  docu  mentary)  on  the  elderly  Jews  of  Venice  Beach  in  California.   Myerhoff’s  work  made  me  think  about  how  we  value  the  “not  so  young”  in  our  society.   While  there  are  nursing-homes  which  in  theory  care  for  our  most  frail  and  vulnerable,  the  reality  is  that  relatively  few  of  us  will  end  our  days  in  such  places.  The  problem  has  become  how  to  fill  our  time  between  retirement  and  meeting  our  Creator.   Myerhoff’s  work  does  open  some  doors  for  us,  although  I  am  sure  that  the  elderly  would  not  like  to  be  the  focus  of  reminiscence  therapy  day  in,  day  out.  Her  work  makes  us  reflect  on  how  we  build  bridges  between  genera  tions  which  are  meaningful  and  not   tokenism.   1  remember  a  discussion  of  a  housing  project  being  considered  in  London;  it  was  to  be  a  mixture  of  a  hostel  for  the  elderly,  a  place  for  university  students  and  a  haven  for  people  with  disabilities.  I  don’t  know  whether  it  eventuated,  but  the  concept  of  mixing  groups  Which  tra  ditionally  would  be  separated  was  an  ^  interesting  one.   As  our  communities  continue  to  build  residences  for  the  elderly,  in  par  ticular,  wouldn’t  it  be  a  good  idea  to  consider  a  more  integrative  approach  to  the  complex,  rather  than  segregating  them  from  the  rest  of  society?

Of  particular  note  is  the  section  'Cyril  on  Referendum'.  Apparently  the  referendum  we  had  recently  had  more  to  do  with  the  NEW  WORLD  ORDER  than  it  did  about  changing  our  constitutional  head  of  state.  It's  priceless.  Send  this  man  emails.  Tell  him  he  has  his  head  in  his  arse.  This  is  a  classic  example  of  why  we  should  not  be  paying  pensions  to  lonely  Queenslanders  with  nothing  better  to  spend  their  money  on  than  stamps,  envelopes,  and  poor  quality  photocopiers.  According  to  our  boy  Cyril,   any  logo  that  has  a  triangle  (pyramid)  in  it  represents  a  company  that  supports  the  New  World  Order,  is  run  by  freemasons,  and  is  anti-  Christ.  Cyril  asks  some  testing  questions  on  the  site  concerning  the  referendum  about  whether  Australia  should  piss  the  Queen  off  or  not.  Some  of  these  questions  will  really  make  you  think  twice,  so  probing  are  they.  For  instance,  ""Why  do  community  leaders  (Church,  Government,  Media,  Business,  etc.)  have  little  or  nothing  to  say  about  the  'NEW  WORLD  ORDER'  (very  determined  -  aren't  they!)""  As  suspicious  as  these  tight-  lipped  community  leaders  are,  nothing  could  rattle  them  more  than  Cyril's  daring  question,  ""Which  change  will  Australia  embrace  first:  -  A)  Republicanism,  or  B)  The  Luciferian  (Communist/Socialist  )  'New  World  Order'?"".

The  City  Council  on  Monday  night  decided  to  put  the  10-  hectare  parcel  on  Robertson  Road,  near  the  Whillas  Road  intersection,  up  for  tender.  Council  chief  executive  officer  Ian  Burfitt  said  the  council  had  completed  a  valuation  of  the  property  and  councillors  decided  last  night  the  most  appropriate  action  would  be  to  accept  tenders.

"  Churches  sIM  on  antt-JMsh  lies   CHRISTIAN  churches  have  been  challenged  to  speak  out  against  the  “untruths”,  “insults”  and  “outrageous  allegations”  levelled  against  Judaism  and  Israel  by  pro  Arab  propagandists.   Australian  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  joint  president  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  says  the  mainstream  churches’  silence  is  the  latest  chapter  in  “a  sorry  history  of  Christian-Jewish  relations,  or  lack  of  them”,  which  has  seen  religious  leaders  in  Germany  ring  church  bells  for  Hitler  and  those  in  pre-1967  Jerusalem  look  the  other  way  as  occupying  Jordanian  forces  destroyed  synagogues  and  Jewish   cemeteries.   “There  are  glaring  lies  being  told,  such  as  the  notion  that  there  was  never  a  Jewish  Temple  on  Mount  Moriah  and  that  the  Temple  Mount  is  only  an  Islamic  site.  The  most  perfunctory  reading  of  the  Bible  disproves  this.  Why  doesn’t  someone  who  reads  the  Bible  stand  up  and  say  so?”   Attempts  by  the  Australian  Jewish  News  to  get  authoritative  Church   reactions  seemed  to  reinforce  Rabbi  Apple’s  comments.  The  head  of  the  Anglican  Church  in  Australia,  Perth’s  Archbishop  Peter  Camley,  was  not  available  for  comment  —  nor  was   his  representative,  Bishop  Brian   Farran.  The  Anglican  Church’s  media  unit  in  Sydney  was  unable  to  find  someone  to  comment,  and  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  was  “unable  to  prepare  a  statement  we  would  be  happy  with  in  the  time  available”.  The  Primate  of  the  Greek  Orthodox  Church  in  Australia,  Archbishop  Stylianos,  avoided  taking  Rabbi  Apple’s  criticisms  head-on,  saying:  “True  Christians,  particularly  true  Orthodox  [Christians]  are  100  per  cent  on  the  side  of  suffering  people  in  any  place  of  crisis,  whether  they  are  Jews  or  non-Jews;  faithful  or  non-faithful.”   However,  a  patron  of  the  Australian  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews,  Reverend  Professor  Davis  McCaughey,  said  reputable  Christian  scholars  agreed  that  claims  disputing  the  presence  of  Jewish  Temples  on  Mount  Moriah  were  “nonsense”.  But  the  Uniting  Church  minister  suggested  that  churches  may  be  shying  away  from  becoming  embroiled  in  a  political  controversy.   “We  live  in  a  time  when  it’s  very  difficult  to  get  intelligent  comments  by  any  religious  bodies  well  heard,  partly  because  none  of  us  like  standing  up  and  saying  that’s  awful  nonsense  because  we  know  that’s  going  to  land  us  in  controversy  ...  I  would  be  in  great  sympathy  with  my  Jewish  friends  who  would  say,  Well,  what  about  putting  an  article  in  such-and-such  a  publication  saying   Rabbi  Raymond  Apple   what  reputable  Christian  scholars   think?’”   Future  sovereignty  over  the  Temple  Mount  was  a  stumbling  block  in  peace  negotiations.  In  January,  the  Palestinian  Authority  affiliated  mufti  of  Jerusalem,  Ikrema  Sabri,  told  the  international  media  that  the  site  was  off  limits  to  all  non  Muslims.  But  while  some  Arab  archaeologists  dispute  the  existence  of  Jewish  Temples  there,  mainstream  archaeologists  fear  that  on-going  illegal  excavations  on  the  Temple  Mount  by  the  Muslim  authority  are  destroying  priceless  antiquities.   Known  as  a  political  moderate,  Rabbi  Apple,  who  is  senior  rabbi  at  the  Great  Synagogue,  told  the  AJN  he  was  surprised  and  disappointed  that  the  sympathetic  response  he  encountered  from  Christians  in   private  had  not  been  reflected  publicly.   Rabbi  Apple:  “I  would  have  thought  that  responsible  Christian  believers  would  have  thought  that  with  what’s  being  peddled  they  would  have  the  religious  and  moral  duty  to  speak  out.  I’m  afraid  there  seems  to  be  an  imbalance.  Jewish  leaders  automatically  speak  out  and  respond  when  they  see  that  something  unfair  and  unjust  is  being  said  anywhere  in  the  world,  but  it  doesn’t  happen  that  when  such  things  are  being  said  about  us  that  people  have  the  same  instinct  to  respond.”   He  told  a  meeting  of  the  Christian   Jewish  Luncheon  Club  last  week   that  Islamic  preaching  and  Palestinian  propaganda  had  included  a  mounting  series  of  insults  to  “Jewish  teaching,  Jewish  doctrine  and  Jewish  history”  including   Holocaust  denial  and  denial  of  the   Temple  in  Jerusalem  as  the  spiritual  focus  of  Jewish  worship.  “Christian  Church  people  could  and  should  be  the  first  to  stand  up  for  and  articulate  the  truth,”  he  said.  “The  cause  of  inter-religious  understanding  surely  demands  that  they  do  this,  and  do  it  urgently.”   Rabbi  Apple,  whose  father  was  born  in  Jerusalem  and  who  has  15  grandchildren  living  in  Israel,  told  the  AJN:  “I’m  speaking  of  the  mainstream  churches  and  I’m   speaking  of  those  who  make  their  interest  in  Christian-Jewish  dialogue  quite  obvious.  When  you  are  in  dialogue  with  someone  it  goes  without  saying  that  when  your  partner  in  dialogue  is  hurting,  you  also  feel  the  pain  ...  I’m  speaking  about  intellectual  pain  —  violence  against  the  truth.  Verbal  violence  is  also  violence,  and  from  verbal  violence  you  can  also  feel  terrible  hurt...  I  bring  up  this  issue  on  every  possible  level...  So  often,  the  private  response  is  very  understanding  or  sympathetic.  But  I’m  looking  for  a  much  more  open  and  public  response.”   Co-director  at  the  Australian  Institute  of  Holocaust  and  Genocide  Studies,  Paul  O’Shea,  said  that  Church  leaders  needed  to  have  the  problem  brought  to  their  attention.   “It’s  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  most  Christians  are  not  readers  of  fundamentalist  Islamic   propaganda.  When  it  does  occur,  I  suspect  the  normal  reaction  is  to  dismiss  it  for  what  it  is  —  that  it’s  hate  propaganda.  I  agree  that  it  should  be  condemned  and  spoken  out  against  by  Christian  leaders,”  the  senior  religious  education  co  ordinator  at  St  Patrick’s  Roman  Catholic  School,  Strathfield,  said.   Islamic  Council  of  New  South  Wales  chairman  Ali  Roude  declined  to  comment. ",2001-04-27

Peter  will  be  observing  in  Wild  Turkey  in  both  Saturday's  Bakers'  Blitz  and  Sunday's  super  class,  while  he  will  also  ski  in  the  30-39-year-old  social  class  on  Saturday  and  the  eight  litre  inboard  social  class  on  Sunday.  Fortunately,  each  time  he  competes  there  will  be  sufficient  time  to  return  to  the  start  line  for  the  next  race,  providing  everything  goes  to  plan.  ""I  hope  each  time  we  fin  ish,""  Peter  said  of  his  busy  weekend.   Tomorrow,  he  will  be  skiing  in  the  30-39-year-old  social  class  behind  Moama  boat  Strongbrew,  driven  by  Jeff  Connell.  After  completing  that  race,  he  will  then  return  to  the  Five  -Mile  boat  ramp  in  readiness  for  the  Bakers'  Blitz  with  Wild  Turkey.   Sunday  morning  will  see  Peter  ski  behind  Echuca  boat  Sonic,  to  be  driven  by  Jamie  Jones  with  Neil  Donald  observing.  Then,  at  12.30pm  on  Sunday,  Peter  will  return  to  the  Tomimbarry  Weir  boat  ramp  with  Wild  Turkey  in  readiness  for  the  super  class  event.   •  Wild  Turkey.

"  Ample  evidence   TO  all  our  Jewish  friends:   The  last  three  weeks  should  have  brought  understanding  to  the  American  peoples  and  their  allies  the  reality  of  what  Israel  has  been  experi  encing  since  1948.   President  George  Bush’s  address  to  Congress  as  a  result  of  the  terrible  acts  of  September  11  should  have  alerted  the  world  to  the  nature  of  the  regime  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza.   Yasser  Arafat  and  his  friends  have  adequate  evidence  against  them  to  be  the  target  of  Bush  and  his  anti-terror  ist  alliance,  and  in  no  way  qualify  to  be  supporters  of  this  cause.   Israel  has  responded  reservedly  in  the  face  of  terrorism  and  is  an  appro  priate  ally  in  this  war  against  terror.   Whatever  the  involvement  of  Osama  bin  Laden  in  this  disaster,  Arafat  and  his  supporters  are  con  ducting  an  unholy  war  against  the  only  democracy  in  the  Middle  East.   The  mountains  of  Israel,  Judea  and  Samaria  (known  as  the  West  Bank),  will  always  be  the  central  feature  of  the  Jewish  homeland,  with  Jerusalem  its  undivided  capital.   raui  Longneld   Christian  Friends  of  Israel ",2001-10-05
"  A  FLOATING  international  community   of  people  from  a  diverse  range  of  cultures  and  backgrounds  is  how  Hans  Christian  Magnus  describes  The   World  of  ResidenSea.   The  ResidenSea  managing  director  was  in  Australia  recently  to  promote  the  cruise  liner,  whose  110  luxury  apartments  are  on  sale  for  between  $US2  million  ($AUS3.7  million)  and  $US6.8  million  ($AUS12.5  mil  lion).   Those  who  have  already  bought  apart  ments  can  look  forward  to  a  maiden  voy  age  this  year  that  will  include  more  than  140  ports  in  40  countries.  Residents  can  live  on  board  full  time  or  join  the  ship  at  any  of  its  port  stays,  which  will  coincide  with  major  world  events  such  as  Rio's  Carnival,  the  Cannes  Film  Festival,  Monaco's  Grand  Prix  and  the  Sydney  to  Hobart  Yacht  Race.   For  those  who  don't  want  to  buy,  there  are  88  guest  suites  for  rent,  and  owners   may  rent  out  their  own  apartments  when  they  don't  need  them.   Mr  Magnus  said  there  were  already  number  of  Jewish  residents  on  the|ef$j«|  liner.  ""We  also  have  a  residents'  conTrniftt$   that  has  been  established  to  look  after  theft  interests  and  one  of  those  membl^f^   Jewish.""  '  -   Because  each  apartment  is  self-contained  with  its  own  food  preparation  area,  there  is  provision  for  kosher  kitchens  on  bbard.  ’I   There  is  also  a  non-denominational   house  of  worship.  ""We  are  consideringlthfS  possibility  of  having  a  rabbi,  Catholic  priest  or  other  religious  leaders  on  board  full  time,""  Mr  Magnus  said.   The  World  of  ResidenSea  Australian  agent,  Gold  Coast-based  Liz  Pfluger  said  the  cruise  liner  had  proved  popular  with  Australians,  particularly  ""prominent  busi?  ness  people,  who  have  recognised:  a  wortf  derful  opportunity  to  be  part  of  a  uniques  concept"".

"  MP  addresses  military  christians  in  Canberra   Former  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  now  self-confessed  'middle-bencher','  Tim  Fischer  MP,  said  many  federal  politicians  have  a  Christian  faith  but  must  put  politics   first,  during  his  speech  to  the  Military  Christian  Fellowship  at  an  all-ranks  lun  cheon  at  Russell  Offices  in  Canberra.  Mr  Fischer  added,  politicians  view  Christianity  as  a  background  to  their  work  and  is  not  ""worn  on  their  sleeve"".  Mr  Fischer  listed  major  influences  on  him  as  a  family  upbringing,  a  Jesuit  education,  three  years  in  the  Army  including  a  tour  in  Vietnam  as  a  company  commander,  and  the  NSW  State  Parliament.  Mr  Fischer's  mostly  rural  Federal  elec  torate  of  Farrer  hugs  the  NSW  side  of  the  Victorian  border  from  Albury  to  the  SA  bor  der.  Taking  the  ANZAC  theme,  Mr  Fischer  recalled  General.  Sir  Harry  Chauvel  in  WWI  who  led  the  Desert  Mounted  Corp  to  attack  .   the  strategically  important  Beersheba  in  October  1917.  The  attack  at  sunset  was  con  trary  to  the  military  manuals  of  the  day,  and  the  surprise  attack  turned,  into  a  rout  of  the  Turkish  forces.  Mr  Fischer  recently  discussed  the  Chauvel  story  with  the  General's  grandson,  John  Mitchell,  of  Towong  Station  in  Fisher's  elec-  ,  torate,  and  heard  how  General  Chauvel  car  ried  Bibles  throughout  his  career,  including  a  pocket  edition  so  he  was  never  without  its  inspiration.  The  Military  Christian  Fellowship  of  Australia  links  Christian  service  men  and  women  and  their  families,  and  Defence  civil  ians,  who  meet  in  most  Defence  ships  and  establishments.

"  Guiding   faithful  tourists   Hinde  Ena  Burstin   CHRISTIAN  pilgrims  form  the  biggest,   most  regular  tourist  group  in  Israel.  That  must  be  a  boon  for  Suzi  Rosedale,  a  Melbourne-born  Jewish  tourist  guide,  whose  work  is  the  subject  of  a  documentary  to  screen  on  SBS  TV  next  week,  Holy  Rollers.   Rosedale  describes  those  on  her  tours  as  “people  with  strong  beliefs  and  love  for  the   land”.   Inevitably,  there  are  security  issues.  Because  some  Christian  sites  are  located  in  areas  under  the  Palestinian  Authority,  Rosedale  has  had  access  to  places  that  few  Jewish  Israelis  see.   “The  groups  love  to  go  through  the  terri  tories  because  it  gives  them  a  keener  sense  of  what  it  was  like  2000  years  ago.  The  ter  races,  Arab  agriculture,  animals  ploughing  the  land,  orchards  with  various  fruit  trees  all  together,  using  every  bit  of  fertile  land  to  grow  something.  Lack  of  agricultural  resources  makes  it  seem  really  biblical.”   Rosedale  felt  “really  nervous”  about  her  own  security  the  first  time  she  took  a  group  to  the  West  Bank.  She  was  also  shocked  by  the  poverty  in  West  Bank  Arab  villages,  which  was  a  stark  contrast  to  some  of  the  wealthy  Jewish  settlements  on  the  hilltops.   The  signing  of  the  Oslo  Accord  brought  confidence  to  the  area.  Foreign  investors,  realising  the  potential  for  tourism,  poured  money  into  restaurants,  hotels,  a  cable-car  in  Jericho  and  other  infrastructure  in  the   West  Bank.  The  rapidly-rising  buildings  were  accompanied  by  a  rising  sense  of  hope.   Through  tourism,  the  area  opened  up  for  both  peoples.  Jewish  tour  guides  were  wel  come  in  Palestinian  restaurants  in  Jenin  and  Nablus.  Jews  and  Palestinians  worked  in  partnership  to  provide  tours  to  Christians.   For  a  time,  it  seemed  that  tourism  could  bridge  the  barriers  between  Jews  and  Pales  tinians,  but  the  optimism  of  early  2000,  when  the  film  was  made,  is  eerie  when  viewed  in  light  of  the  events  that  have  unfolded  since  filming  was  completed.   Director  Rosie  Jones  shows  Rosedale  teaching  her  tourists  Havenu  Shalom  Ale  ichem,  and  the  busdriver  discussing  Ramadan.  “I  love  working  with  Jews,  Chris  tians  and  Muslims,”  Rosedale  says.  “I  love  that  constant  shift  between  the  three.  Every  body  works  together  in  tourism.”   Rosedale  could  see  trouble  brewing.  “Travelling  through  the  territories  as  a  tour  guide,  I  would  see  more  and  more  settle  ments  springing  up  after  Oslo.  I  kept  thinking  ‘Aren’t  we  supposed  to  be  dismantling  the  settlements?  Isn’t  that  part  of  the  peace   deal?’”   After  the  second  intifada  broke  out,  all  her  booked  tour  groups  cancelled.  Rosedale  has  been  in  Australia  since  January,  studying  for  a  Master’s  degree  in  Hebrew  Language  and  Literature  at  Melbourne  University.   But  now  she  is  returning  to  Israel.  “It  has  been  rocky  living  in  Australia  this  year,”  she  says,  “It  is  so  much  easier  living  in  Israel.  The  paranoia  in  Australia  is  hard  to  cope  with.”   In  Israel  she  has  hope  for  the  future.  “Eventually,  we  will  all  get  sick  of  the  fight  ing.  The  senseless  killing  on  both  sides  will  have  to  stop.  If  there  is  a  just  solution,  then  slowly,  we  will  start  building  up  trust  again.  It  will  take  much  longer  to  restore  confi  dence  than  after  the  first  intifada.  More  and  more  people  on  both  sides  know  people  who  have  been  killed.  But  trust  has  to  be  built  up  again,  because  we  will  always  neighbours.”   ■  Holy  Rollers  screens  on  SBS  TV  on  October   19. ",2001-10-12
"  MUSINGS   Cohen   ABBI  David  Rosen  visited  Australia  recent  ly,  speaking  about  the  relationship  between  X  ^Judaism  and  the  Christian  world.  Less  known  to  readers  is  his  brother,  Rabbi  Jeremy  Rosen,  who  heads  up  an  interesting  study  centre   in  London  called  Yakar.   Rabbi  Jeremy  Rosen  recently  wrote  an  op-ed  piece  in  London’s  Jewish  Chronicle  entitled  Not  so  Dashing,  which  discussed  the  growing  trend  to  spell  “G-d”  without  the  “o”.  It  is  all  based  on  inter  pretation  of  the  Third  Commandment  of  not  tak  ing  Gd’s  name  in  vain.   I  admit  that  I  do  it  from  something  I  learned  as  a  child,  and  try  as  I  might,  I  find  it  hard  to  break  the  habit  of  writing  “G-d”,  although  I  know  it  could  be  viewed  as  a  form  of  absurd  pietism.   The  reality  is  that  English  has  only  one  word  for  God  (although  we  use  many  others  to  describe  concepts,  such  as  “Lord”  and  “Almighty""),  while  theologically,  Hebrew  has  seven,  conjuring  up  different  aspects  of  the  Deity.  Within  mystical  tradition,  there  are  between  42  and  231  names  for  G-d,  as  well  as  many  syn  onyms.   In  the  traditional  world,  rather  than  using  G-d’s  name  in  Hebrew,  it  has  become  common  to  use  Hashem,  meaning  The  Name.  In  post-biblical  Hebrew,  Makom,  Place,  was  introduced  as  yet  another  substitute.  Rabbi  Rosen  suggests  that  this  would  be  a  welcome  change  since  it  implies  that  G-d  is  everywhere  and  is  not  limited  tempo  rally.   What  Rabbi  Rosen  failed  to  address  is  the  habit  of  more  and  more  names  being  given  the  “dash  treatment”,  such  as  “L-rd”.

"  Abu  Sinan  faces  new  reality   Daniel  Ben-Tal   JERUSALEM  —  The  12,000  Muslim,  Druse,  and  Christian  residents  of  the  Western  Galilee  village  of  Abu  Sinan  were  stunned  by  the  news  that  one  of  their  neighbours,  Muhammad  Shaker  Habeishi,  was  a  suicide  bomber.  The  news  renewed  fears  of  alienation  from   the  country’s  Jewish  majority.   “We  haven’t  awakened  from   the  shock  yet,”  local  council  mem  ber  Haled  Sabah  told  the  Jerusalem  Post  on  Monday.  “I  can’t  believe  that  he  was  responsible.  We  hope  ...  that  it  wasn’t  him.”   “Nobody  understands  what  really  happened,”  said  Habeishi’s  son-in-law  Samer  Gadvan,  28.  “He  has  not  been  seen  since  Thursday,  30  August.  He  disappeared  that  evening  ...  They  say  that  the  body  of  the  suicide  bomber  was  so  man  gled  that  it  cannot  be  identified,  yet  they  produce  a  perfectly  good  ID  card  from  the  dead  man’s  pock  et!  Maybe  it  was  stolen?”   No  mourning  tent  has  been  set  up  outside  Habeishi’s  modest  house.  His  family  insists  that  he  was  not  the  Nahariya  suicide  bomber,  and  observed  a  normal  working  day.  “I’m  convinced  that  he  didn’t  do  it,”  said  Gadvan.  “He  did  not  belong  to  the  Islamic  Movement  and  was  a  respected   man  —  he  had  no  reason  to  com   mit  such  an  act.”   Jerusalem  Post ",2001-09-14

"  Forgotten  by  all  but  God   □  THE  media  has  failed  abjectly  to  cover  the  curious  plight  of  the  two  Australian  Christian  zealots  held  in  Afghanistan.  Diana  Thomas  and  Peter  Bunch  was  arrested  in  August  along  with  four  Germans  and  two   Americans  while  trying  to  flog  evangelical  Christianity  to  a  population  which  is  99.9  per  cent  Muslim.  While  the  war  and  drought-ravaged  Afghans  desperately  need  food  and  technical  assistance,  Thomas,  Bunch  et  al  brought  hundreds  of  Bibles  and  more  than  6,000  tape  casettes.  The  Taliban  was  at  the  point  of  deporting  them  four  weeks  ago  when  their  investigation  took  a  new  turn  and  suddenly  its  was  announced  that  all  the  detainees  would  go  on  trial.  What  did  the  Taliban  uncover?  The  missionaries  belong  to  a  vague  organisation  called  Shelter  Now  but  no  one  in  the  media  has  bothered  to  check  it  out.  Compare  the  media  treatment  of  Thomas  and   Bunch  with  the  hue  and  cry  over  the  cpature  of  CARE  Australia  workers  Steve  Pratt  and  Peter  Wallace  in  1999.  When  they  were  detained  by  the  Yugoslav  authorities  trying  to  flee  to  neighbouring  Hungary  just  after  the  NATO  bombing  started,  the  media  was  saturated  with  coverage  and  high-profile  diplomatic  efforts  by  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  and  Foreign  Minister  Alexander  Downer.  Yet  the  two  Christians  from  Western  Australia,  headquarters  of  the  SAS,  are  fighting  to  get  a  line  in  the  papers  of  a  mention  on  the  news.  Why?  And  finally,  Barfly  is  eagerly  awaiting  a  statement  from  the  head  honchos  of  Shelters  Now  opposing  and  US-led  invasion  of  Afghanistan  or  the  bombing  destruction  of  Kabul.  That  would  be  the  Christian  thing  to  do,  but  will  it  happen?  Will  someone  on  the  news  desk  contact  Shelter  Now  -  wherever  it  is  located  -  and  ask  what's  happening.  Two  Aussie  Christians  may  be  about  to  be  incinerated. ",2001-10-09
"  Threats  and  bribes,  it's  Christmas   ?   ?   Welcome  to  October  19  —  only  70  sleeps  to  Christmas.  At  this  time  of  the  year,  those  with  a  vested  interest  —  namely  people  with  things  to  sell,  people  with  things  to  buy  and  people  who  hope  to  receive  things  bought  and  sold  —  begin  the  countdown  to  Santa.  This  year  is  a  double  treat  for  the  counters,  with  only  21  babykissing  days  to  the  federal  election.  It's  hard  to  know  which  race  is  the  more  exciting,  with  promises,  threats,  bribes  and  hopes  abounding  in  both.  On  the  one  hand,  parents  are  warning  small  children  Santa  Claus  won't  come  if  they  aren't  good.  On  the  other,  Triple  J   listeners  are  warned  to  vote  on  November  10  or  shut  up  for  the  next  three  years.  Poll-goers  and  stocking  owners  alike  have  put  in  their  wish-lists  —  less  personal  income  tax,  no  more  GST,  a  new  bike  and/or,  but  preferably  and,  a  Nintendo.  In  both  cases,  those  who  hold  the  power  and  the  purse,  or  hope  to,  plead  budget  limitations.  It's  rapidly  becoming  too  late  to  come   up  with  a  new  need;  no  time  to  develop  a  Grey  Card  for  older  Australians,  or  build  a  backyard  in-ground  swimming  pool.  Serious  Christmas  countdowners  can  keep  track  of  the  days  with  a  single  sheet  wall  calendar  depicting  a  house  with  many  windows.  The  shutters  on  each  window  opens  on  a  different  day  to  reveal  a  little  gift,  a  promise  of  bigger  and  better  things  to  come  on  The  Day.  Monday  —  a  chocolate  elf.  Tuesday  —  a  chocolate  reindeer.  Wednesday  —  a  chocolate  Christmas  tree.  Thursday  —  a  singing  angel.  So  it  is  in  the  political  arena  in  which  voters  rise  each  day  to  a   new  tempter  in  the  newspaper  or  over  the  air  waves.  Monday  —  more  money  for  health.  Tuesday  —  improved  aged  care.  Wednesday  —  a  lower  surplus.  Thursday  —  a  singing  federal  treasurer.  For  true  punters,  party  people  and  optimists  the  big  one  is  only  17  sleeps  away.  The  Melbourne  Cup  also  approaches  with  inducements  to  commit,  offers  of  reward,  expectations  of  celebration  and,  like  Christmas  and  elections,  inevitable  disappointment.  At  least  the  dates  of  all  three  major  events  are  declared  and  unmoveable.  If  only  the  countdown  could  begin  for  the  opening  of  a  second  Echuca-Moama  bridge  across  the  Murray. ",2001-10-19

"  School  waits  for  tender  decision  from  City  Council   PORT  Lincoln's  push  for  a  new  Christian  school  could  become  a  reality  with  the  successful  tender  for  their  proposed  site  set  to  be  announced.  Flinders  Association  for  Christian  Education  (FACE)  chairman  Darryn  Johnson  said  tenders  for  the  sale  of  land  along  Robertson  Road  closed  on  April  20.  Mr  Johnson  said  the  proposed  Flinders  Christian  College  was  gaining  momentum  with  37  school  fee  deposits  received  and  34  expressions  of  interest  also  being  lodged.  The  school  would  cater  for  students  in   Reception  to  Year  4  he  said,  with  the  facility  expected  to  be  ready  for  the  start  of  Term  1  next  year.  ""By  early  May  we  will  know  if  we  can  build,""  Mr  Johnson  said.  ""If  we  don't  get  the  land  our  second  option  is  to  use  the  Salvation  Army  facilities.  ""That  would  be  good  on  a  short  term  basis  but  ultimately  we  want  to  build  our  own  school.""  With  a  68  student  capacity,  Mr  Johnson  said  the  non-denominational  school  aimed  to  add  a  schooling  year  each  year.  ""In  the  future  we're  looking  at  high  school  and   a  boarding  house,""  he  said.  ""We've  had  enormous  response  for  the  high  school  but  we  need  to  establish  a  primary  school  first.""  FACE  has  received  four  applications  for  the  position  of  principal,  and  building  of  the  $100,000  first  stage  is  hoped  to  commence  in  September.  Port  Lincoln  City  Council  chief  executive  officer  Ian  Burfitt  said  significant  interest  had  been  shown  in  the  site  and  following  the  closing  of  tenders  the  Council  was  expected  to  discuss  it  at  last  night's  City  Council  meeting.

"  faith-based  plan   Sharon  Sasnhas   WASHINGTON  —  Recent  comments  by  the  '  director  of  a  Christian  social  services  program   praising  the  proselytisation  of  Jews  are  fuelling  Jewish  opposition  to  President  Bush’s  faith   based  initiative.   John  Castellani,  executive  director  of  Teen  Challenge,  a  substance  abuse  treatment  pro  gram,  said  in  testimony  before  Congress  last  week  that  Jews  at  his  centre  were  “completed”  —  that  is,  had  accepted  Jesus  —  as  part  of   their  treatment.   Officials  of  the  Anti-Defamation  League  and  the  Religious  Action  Centre  of  Reform  Judaism  said  Castellani’s  testimony  shows  the  dangers  involved  in  funnelling  federal  funds  to  social  service  organisations  that  might  proselytise.   Both  groups  sent  letters  to  Bush  expressing  concern  about  the  White  House  plan  to  fund  faith-based  social  service  programs  such  as  Teen  Challenge.   Many  Jewish  leaders  fear  that  an  expanded  partnership  between  the  government  and  faith-based  institutions  could  break  down  the  constitutional  wall  separating  church  and  state,  infringe  on  religious  liberties  and  imply  toleration  of  employment  discrimination.   Groups  have  cautioned  that  the  administra  tion’s  proposal  does  not  have  proper  safe  guards  against  religious  coercion.  The  latest  incident  only  highlights  Jewish  groups’  fears  that  the  federal  government  ultimately  will  fund  proselytising  activity.   Under  the  Bush  proposal,  even  if  the  gov  ernment  does  not  directly  fund  such  activity,  charitable  choice  laws  will  fund  and  strength  en  organisations  that  make  proselytising  a  core  component  of  their  work,  according  to  Rabbi  David  Saperstein,  director  of  the  Reli  gious  Action  Centre  of  Reform  Judaism.   “When  speaking  of  the  need  for  government  to  help  faith-based  organisations  transform  lives,  is  proselytising  of  Jews  and  other  non  Christians  what  you  had  in  mind?”  Saperstein  xt/  asked  in  his  letter  to  the  president.  “Are  you   prepared  to  lend  government  endorsement  and  support  to  programs  or  organisations  with  such  an  overt  mission?”   In  their  letter,  ADL’s  national  chairman  Glen  A  Tobias  and  national  director  Abraham  Fox  man  said  the  testimony  at  the  House  Govern  ment  Reform  subcommittee  hearing  showed  faith-based  organisations  would  be  either  “unable  or  unwilling  to  separate  their  power  to  transform  lives  from  their  theologically  grounded  mission  to  proselytise  and  convert.  4  ^  Members  of  other  Jewish  groups—such  as   Hadassah,  The  Women’s  Zionist  Organisation  of  America  and  the  American  Jewish  Congress  —  and  religious  liberties  groups  also  spoke  out  against  the  potential  for  government  financed  proselytising.  m ",2001-06-08
"  Uproar  over   helping  out  on  Easter  Sunday   JEWISH  involvement  in  a  Christian  function  on  Easter  Sunday  became  the  focus  of  a  ruckus  at  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  last  week.   Deputy  Otto  Waldman  shouted  down  Annamarie  Cohen  as  she  answered  his  criticism  of  kipa~  wearing  Temple  Emanuel  mem  bers  being  involved  in  the  function.   Mr  Waldman  called  her  “crazy”  and  “insane”  as  she  explained  that  temple  members  had  fed  the  poor  and  homeless  at  an  Easter  Sunday  function  organised  by  Ashfield  Unit  ing  Church  Reverend  Bill  Crewes.   Temple  board  member  Ruth  Guth  said  involvement  in  the  func  tion  was  “not  celebrating  Easter;  it’s  simply  a  matter  of  tikkun  olam  (healing  the  world)”.   Commented  Myer  Samra:  “East  er  Sunday  is  the  commemoration  of  the  crucifixion  of  Jesus,  which  the  New  Testament  blames  the  Jews  for.  So  what  some  are  partici  pating  in  is  celebration  of  the  com  memoration  of  the  crucifixion,  and  commemoration  of  the  evil  of  the  Jews  as  portrayed  by  the  New  Tes  tament  It’s  the  most  inappropriate  day  for  Jews  to  involved  in.”   However,  Board  president  Stephen  Rothman  replied:  “Notwithstanding  our  non-belief  in  Jesus  as  the  Messiah,  I  don’t  see  that  there’s  great  harm  done  in  the  Jewish  community  assisting  the  poor  in  the  general  community  who  don’t  have  enough  to  eat.”   B  Board  report,  page  8 ",2001-03-02
"  Talking  to  the  Church   THE  Middle  East  crisis  was  a  key  issue  dis  cussed  by  Christian  and  Jewish  leaders  when  they  met  recently  at  the  Great  Synagogue.   The  Uniting  Church  in  Australia  and  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  held  their  14th  formal  dialogue  —  part  of  a  process  aimed  at  discussing  issues  of  common  con  cern  “in  an  atmosphere  of  openness  and  mutual  respect”.   A  great  deal  of  the  discussion  focused  on  the  way  in  which  the  media  has  tended  to  sen  sationalise  and  distort  events  on  the  ground.   There  was  a  shared  view  that  the  media   should  be  contributing  to  understanding  and  providing  audiences  with  a  sufficient  basis  to  make  a  constructive  contribution  to  the  reso  lution  of  the  conflict,  rather  than  exacerbating   tension.   The  leaders  also  discussed  the  way  in   Australian  Institute  of  Holocaust  and  Genocide  Studies  co-director  Professor  Colin  Tab,  Shalom  Institute  CEO  Dr  Hilton  Immermsn,  Professor  Yalr  Auron,  Peta  Jones  Pellach.   Those  attending  the  lunch  and  lecture  at  Shalom  College  Included  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  youth  coordinator  Karen  Erdos  and  research  assistant  Aviva  Bard.   which  both  Church  and  Synagogue  are  meet  ing  challenges  of  connecting  with  the  person  al  spirituality  sought  by  many  Australians.  Participants  shared  observations  highlighting  common  issues  confronting  Jews  and  Christians  in  Australia  today.   Dr  John  Bodycomb  of  Melbourne,  who  co  chairs  the  dialogue  on  behalf  of  the  Uniting  Church,  said  the  dialogue  was  “one  of  the  most  successful  meetings  since  the  process  began.  Christians  and  Jews  leam  more  about  themselves  the  more  they  leam  about  the  other.”   Co-chair  and  ECAJ  national  vice-president  Jeremy  Jones  noted  that  “the  atmosphere  of  mutual  respect  and  complete  honesty  makes  each  dialogue  meeting  a  uniquely  meaningful  experience.  Together  with  our  Uniting  Church  partners  in  dialogue,  we  look  forward  to  con  tinuing  our  mutual  exploration  of  matters  of  concern  to  all  people  of  goodwill,  when  we   next  meet  in  November.” ",2001-05-18
"  Ducking  for  cover   ?   ?   A  poet  wrote  that  from  troubles  of  the  world  he  turned  to  ducks.  Around  here,  it's  more  like  chooks.  There  is  something  therapeutic  about  a  huddle  of  hens.  Forget  the  spa  bath  when  you  want  to  unwind.  Instead,  step  outside  and  watch  the  chooks  wandering  contentedly  round  in  their  food.  The  quiet  little  chirpy  noise  of  a  happy  free-range  hen  is  music  to  the  savage  brain.  Someone  should  make  a  CD  of  chook  songs  —  far  more  soothing  than  whining  whales  and  sloshy  surf  sounds.  Lavender  may  assist  in  relaxation,  and  rosemary  stimulate  memory,  but  the  earthy  aroma  of  fresh  chook  poop  clears  the  sinuses.  Around  3pm  is  best.  In  the  morning,  the  girls  and  their  rooster  awake  exhilarated  at  having  survived  another  fox-free  night.  But  by  3pm,  exhaustion  kicks  in.  Each  chook  digs  a  little  dust  ditch  for  herself  and  settles  down  for  a  rest.  Scientific  studies  have  shown  Greek  men  who  take  a  siesta  reduce  their  risk  of  heart  attack.  Who  says  chooks  are  silly?  Unlike  their  frenetic,  featherless  friends,  chooks  follow  the  logic  of  the  seasons.  In  winter,  they  sleep  late  and  turn   in  early.  In  summer,  with  extra  daylight,  they  put  in  much  longer  days.  Historians  tell  us  this  is  how  people  scheduled  their  days  until  Mr  Edison  invented  electric  lights.  For  chooks,  it's  one  thing  at  a  time.  Take  eating.  Unable  to  scavenge,  scratch  and  consume  simultaneously,  the  dinner  dance  goes  ...  bend,  peck,  straighten,  scratch,  repeat.  Sure  it's  time  consuming  but  what  else  is  on  the  agenda?  Even  egg  laying  is  undertaken  slowly,  in  a  spot  selected  for  its  comfort  and  seclusion,  a  far  cry  (or  cluck)  from  childbirth.  Furthermore,  chooks  need  far  less  water  than  ducks  —  an  important  factor  given  that  drought  is  one  of  the  world  troubles  you  may  want  to  turn  from. ",2001-04-12

"  Ciiisrcli  dogma   LEANNE  Piggott’s  and  Peter  Wertheim’s  attempt  at  “penetrating  the  sources  of  Christian  anti  semitism”  (AJN  25/05/01)  displays  a  strange  manner  of  penetration  of  such  a  complex  issue.   The  Catholic  Church  at  the  Vatican  II  Council  did  not  “ambiguously”  repudiate  the  doctrine  of  the  Jewish  people’s  guilt  of  deicide.  Nostra  Aetate  maintained  the  charge  of  dei  cide  against  the  Jews.   The  declaration  states:  “True,  authorities  of  the  Jews  and  those  who  followed  their  lead  pressed  for  the  death  of  Christ...  still,  what  hap  pened  in  His  passion  cannot  be  blamed  upon  all  the  Jews  then  living  ...”  Therefore,  the  Jews  are  blamed  for  the  death  of  Jesus;  however,  not  all  of  them  and  not  the  “Jews  of  today”.   This  does  not  remove  the  guilt  of  the  Jews.  We,  the  Jews  of  today,  can  expurgate  this  notion  only  if  we  repu  diate  as  our  ancestors  those  “some”  Jews  clearly  “guilty”,  God  forbid.   Secondly,  the  footnotes  to  the  above  paragraph  of  Nostra  Aetate  read  that  “the  phrase”  guilty  of  dei  cide  (deicidi  red)  was  dropped  for  the  Catholically  logical  reason  that  it  could  have  suggested  that  “the  Church  no  longer  regarded  Jesus  as  God”.  Therefore,  “deicide”  remains  entrenched  in  Catholic  dogma.   It  is  obvious  that  the  authors  are  not  familiar  with  the  primary  source,  the  Vatican  U  document  to  which  they  refer,  when  they  espouse  the  strange  notion  of  “chapter  and  verse  refutation  of  the  Catholic  Church  and  indeed,  all  the  churches”  of  para  graphs  of  the  Christian  Gospels.   One  is  curious  if,  should  the  Vatican  refute  the  claimed  para  graphs,  would  Ms  Piggott  and  Mr  Wertheim  be  happy  with  the  revised  Gospels.

"  What's  in  a  name?   When  Auntie  Es  said  to  smile  for  the  camera,  everyone  started  scratching.  The  trouble  was,  Auntie  Es  was  in  India,  taking  photos  of  Indians,  and  her  knowledge  of  the  Tamil  language  was  limited  (nine  words  and  three  phrases,  to  be  exact).  In  Tamil,  the  word  for  smile  also  means  scratch,  depending  on  how  you  say  it.  Say  it  up,  and  mouths  lift;  say  it  down,  and  you  could  witness  an  apparent  spontaneous  outbreak  of  parasites.  Silly?  Not  really.  Languages  are  like  that,  full  of  subtlety,  strange  sounds  and  unnecessarily  difficult  spellings  (like  subtlety).  Even  in  English,  the  emphasis  you  put  on  a  word  in  a  sentence  can  alter  the  meaning.  Only  last  week,  I  received  a  joke  via  hotmail  about  a  prominent  Australian  politician  (who  won't  be  named  for  fear  of  offending  any  One  Nation  supporters  reading  this).  The  punch  line  read:  ""I  killed  the  cow""  which  made  the  joke  funnier  than  it  would  been  if  spoken  because  the  chauffeur  would  have  said  ""I  killed  the  cow"".  (Now  you  can  spend  the  rest  of  the  day  trying  to  work  out  what  the  story  line  was.  Don't  you  hate  that?  I  spent  two  years  trying  to  remember  the  joke  which  ended  ""And  the  next  day  the  headlines  read,  Ventriloquist  found  killed  in  alley"".)  English  is  full  of  homonyms,  words  which  sound  alike  but  have  different  meanings,  such  as  there  their,  hear  here  and  know  no.  Americans,  in  that  down  to  basics  way  of  theirs,  call  buoys  (floating  markers)  booeys.  This  is  useful  when  you  want  to  alert  the  lifeguard  to  a  child  about  to  drown  but  to  the  English-speaking  ear  sounds  incredibly  puerile  (or  pooerile  as  the  Americans  say).  The  oddest  thing  about  our  language,  is  what  we  do  to  names.  Everyone  likes  to  know  that  the  first  name  with  which  their  parents  so  thoughtfully  endowed  them  has  a  deep  and  personal  significance.  It's  lovely  for  a  beautiful  young  girl  to  know  as  she  goes  about  her  day  that  her  name  means  'graceful  gazelle  gliding  like  moonlight  through  the  forest'.  Or  for  a  bloke  to  run  out  on  to  the   ?   ?   footy  field  aware  his  name  is  Aboriginal  for  'hunts  with  the  pack  and  kicks  butt'.  But  in  too  many  instances,  we  allow  our  names  to  be  abbreviated  beyond  recognition,  bringing  to  it  a  whole  new  meaning.  For  instance,  Matthew,  who  was  a  gift  of  the  lord,  becomes  a  door  rag  for  people  to  wipe  their  feet  on  (mat).  Nicholas  and  his  female  counterpart  Nicol,  formerly  victors  of  the  people,  are  relegated  to  the  status  of  a  small  cut  or  the  place  Pommie  police  place  their  crims  (nick).  Worst  still,  they  may  become  items  of  women's  underwear  (flickers).  The  God-like  Michael  risks  becoming  an  instrument  for  increasing  volume  (mike)  while  Patrick,  an  upperclass  person,  drops  to  the  level  of  a  pat  as  in  cow  ...  or  what  you  do  to  dogs.  Monica,  sainted  mother  of  St  Augustine,  becomes  a  tomato  sauce  manufacturer  (MON)  while  Natalie,  born  at  Christmas  time  becomes  the  sort  of  bug  that  flies  into  your  eyes  when  you're  riding  a  bike  (gnat).  Priceless  Anthony  turns  into  a  small  insect  of  the  hymenopterous  order  occasionally  found  in  a  person's  pants  (ant);  protector  William  is  an  unwelcome  claim  for  money  (Bill),  Marjory,  a  Scottish  Margaret,  becomes  a  disappointing  alternative  to  butter  (maij)  while  Dorothea,  another  gift  from  God,  shrinks  so  small  she's  hardly  worth  mentioning  (dot).  Even  surnames  are  not  exempt.  The  ancient  and  interesting  moniker  of  Chudley,  for  instance,  dating  back  to  beyond  1086  and  the  Doomsday  Book,  becomes  Chud,  the  name  chosen  by  horror  writer  Steven  King  for  an  evil,  ugly,  subterranean  creature  which  crawled  out  of  a  sewer  and  made  trouble.

"  VIEWPOINT   Gaiy  Rosenblatt   ET’S  be  honest  here:  if  I  say   “evangelical  Christian”,  do  J—&amp;  you  think  “antisemite”,  or  merely  “millennium-crazed,  Bible  toting  missionary”?   You’d  probably  be  surprised  if  I  said  the  correct  answer,  in  most  cases,  is  not  only  one  who  believes  a  spiritual  rebirth  is  necessary  for  salvation  and  who  often  has  a  zeal  for  proselytising,  but  one  who  sup  ports  Israel  and  the  Jewish  people,  prayerfully  and  financially.  Even  so,  you  might  suggest  that  an  evangeli  cal’s  motives  are  suspect,  that  the  only  reason  for  this  support  is  to  fulfil  a  prophecy  that  the  Jews  in  the  Land  of  Israel  will  see  the  light  and  accept  Jesus  at  the  end  of  days.   Truth  is,  while  we  are  quick  to  accuse  others  of  anti-Jewish  senti  ments,  we  tend  to  nurture  and  defend  rather  than  question  our  own  negative  stereotypes  about  oth  ers,  especially  religious  Christians.   And  we  are  prejudiced  against  them,  despite  the  fact  that  they  pray  for,  defend  and  tour  Israel  —  an  estimated  60  per  cent  of  tourists  to  the  Jewish  State  are  evangelicals  (and  they  don’t  cancel  their  trips  after  terror  incidents  like  we  do).   Moreover,  they  contribute  to  Israel  and  Jewish  causes  in  large  numbers.   American  Jews  seem  more  fear  ful  than  respectful  of  devout  Chris  tians.  We  engage  in  interfaith  dialogue  with  Catholics  and  with  lib   eral  Protestant  denominations,  but  tend  to  discuss  evangelicals,  who  number  some  70  million  in  America,  in  the  context  of  cults  and  mission  aries,  and  how  to  counteract  them.   Polls  consistently  show  that  Jews  think  of  evangelicals  as  anti  semitic,  though  the  same  polls  show  they  are  not,  and  that  little  effort  is  made  to  educate  Jews  or  meet  with  evangelicals.   What  upsets  Jews  most  is  that  evangelicals  say  it  is  their  mission  to  proselytise.  Certainly  there  are  Christians  who  see  helping  Jews  and  Israel  as  a  precursor  to  hasten  ing  messianic  days,  but  most  sim  ply  have  been  taught  through  Bible  study  that  it  is  a  blessing  to  support  Israel  and  the  Jewish  people.   Lumping  mainline,  fundamen  talist  and  Pentecostal  Christians  together  is  as  naive  and  ignorant  as  failing  to  see  the  distinctions  among  modern  Orthodox,  Charedi   and  Chassidic  Jews.   Steven  Bayme  of  the  American  Jewish  Committee  notes  that  “our  views  toward  Christians  reflect  a  lack  of  maturity  among  American  Jews.  We  still  fear  Christianity  as  if  it  repre  sented  the  church  of  past  centuries.”   It’s  time  to  confront  that  fear.

"  Central  Coast   community  mourns  Stephen  Sanig,  7   MORE  than  300  members  of  the  Jewish  and  Christian  communities  of  the  Central  Coast  of  New  South  Wales  gathered  at  the  gravesite  of  seven-year-old  Stephen  Sanig  in  the  Jewish  cemetery  at  Norahville  last  week.   The  son  of  Central  Coast  Shalom  Progressive  Jewish  Congregation  president  Michael  Sanig  and  Sue-Anne  Sanig,  Stephen  died  at  Gosford  Hospital  of  complications  arising  from  meningococcal  disease.   As  a  tribute  to  his  popularity,  his  school,  St  John  Fisher  Primary  School  in  Tumbi  Umbi,  closed  for  the  day  as  a  mark  of  respect.   Also  as  a  tribute  to  Stephen,  his  family  and  the  local  congregation,  the  funeral  service  was  conducted  by  three  rabbis  —  Rabbi  Emeritus  John  Levi,  regional  director  of  the  Australian  Asian  and  New  Zealand  Union  of  Progressive  Judaism  for  Small  Congregations;  Rabbi  Jacqueline  Ninio  of  Temple  Emanuel,  Woollahra;  and  Rabbi  Allison  Conyer  of  North  Shore  Temple.   It  was  also  attended  by  AANZUPJ  presi  dent  Penny  Jakobovits  and  treasurer  Peter  Colliner,  both  of  Melbourne.   Despite  his  young  age,  Stephen  was  deeply  committed  to  his  Judaism,  and  he  was  a  pop  ular  and  valued  member  of  his  congregation  and  of  the  Hebrew  and  Religion  School,  where  he  was  an  exemplary  student.   From  an  early  age,  he  showed  a  proficien  cy  for  blowing  the  shofar,  regularly  doing  the  honours  at  the  congregation’s  High  Holy  Day   celebrations.   At  the  congregation’s  recent  lOth-anniver  sary  celebration,  the  Shabbat  morning  serv   ice  concluded  with  Stephen  blowing  the  sho   far.   His  community  involvement  included  a  recent  blowing  of  the  shofar  before  20,000  parents  and  children  at  the  Olympic  Superdome  in  Sydney  to  inaugurate  the  Broken  Bay  Diocese  Catholic  Schools’  jubilee  year  celebrations.   Stephen  had  a  yellow  belt  in  tae-kwon-do  —  and,  in  a  moving  gesture  at  the  graveside,  was  posthumously  awarded  a  black  belt  by  the  Tae-Kwon-Association.   He  leaves  a  grieving  community,  but  that  one  that  has  been  enriched  by  his  short  life  which  touched  many  quarters  of  the  Central  Coast  and  the  wider  Progressive  Jewish   world.   Those  attending  the  funeral  service  included  visitors  from  Melbourne,  Brisbane,  Sydney  and  family  members  from  Manchester,  England.   Stephen  died  of  severe  septic  shock  about  14  hours  after  he  first  showed  signs  of  ill   ness.   He  had  been  taken  to  hospital  with  a  fever  and  after  vomiting  for  several  hours;  was  checked  for  meningococcal  symptoms  such  as  neck  stiffness  and  sensitivity  to  light  and  observed  for  several  hours;  and  then  sent  home.  His  parents  returned  him  to  hospital   when  his  condition  worsened  and  a  rash   appeared.   He  was  treated  with  antibiotics  and  taken  to  intensive  care,  but  his  conditioned  deteri  orated.   The  matter  has  been  referred  to  Central  Coast  coroner  John  Arms.

"  ASK  THE  RABBI   Rabbi  Raymond  Apple   RECENTLY  a  large  crowd  came  to  hear  the  new  i  i  Roman  Catholic  archbishop  of  Sydney  speaking   with  Rabbi  David  Rosen  of  Jerusalem  on  Christ  ian-Jewish  relations.  The  archbishop  made  some  important  statements,  but  the  media  was  not  satisfied.  Ever  since  his  appointment,  they  have  noted  sadly  that,  within  the  context  of  his  own  tradition,  he  toes  an  orthodox  line.   Large  sections  of  the  Jewish  public  also  con  stantly  insist  that  Orthodoxy  must  bend  with  the  wind,  accommodate  itself  to  today  and  be  accepting  of  everything.  Nothing  must  be  treif  any  longer,  and  all  must  be  made  kosher.   It  is  not  a  new  argument.  The  decisive  answer  came  from  Rabbi  Samson  Raphael  Hirsch  in  19th-century  Germany.  Instead  of  making  Judaism  conform  with  the  times,  he  said,  why  «/  not  make  the  times  conform  with  Judaism?   When  the  tail  wags  the  dog  and  religion  is  told,  “Don’t  give  us  a  lead  unless  it  takes  us  where  we  want  to  go”,  then  truth  is  replaced  by  falsehood,  respect  by  repression,  justice  by  vic  timisation,  find  individual  dignity  by  fads  and  addictions.  When  the  times  become  the  stan  dard  and  eternal  verities  can  no  longer  be  pro  claimed,  religion  might  as  well  close  down.   “But  that’s  not  what  we  are  taking  about,”  say  some  people.  So  what  are  you  talking  about?  “Well,”  we  hear,  “Why  is  it  so  hard  to  keep  kosher?”  Answer:  commitment  costs  effort.  ^  Kashrut  commits  you  to  self-control  and  inner   discipline  —  old  principles,  but  probably  as  important  as  truth,  respert,  justice  and  dignity.   “Why  can’t  we  do  this  or  that  on  Shabbat?”  Answer  if  you  want  everything  to  be  be  easy  and  comfortable,  that’s  nice  and  pleasant—but  you  don’t  have  much  backbone,  and  backbone  (another  word  for  moral  courage)  is  another  old  principle  that  is  as  important  as  truth,  respect,  justice  and  dignity.   “Why  don’t  they  modernise  the  prayer  book,  shorten  the  service,  have  less  Hebrew?”  Answer:  fine,  let’s  argue  that  out  —  but  don’t  forget  that  to  unite  with  past,  present  and  the  future  also  ■*\  ranks  with  truth  and  the  other  principles.   Why  do  the  times  commend  themselves  to  us?  Because  we  think  modernity  is  attractive.  But  it  is  also  notoriously  fickle,  it  scares  us  with  its  selfishness,  callousness,  lack  of  respect  for  life,  dignity,  conscience  or  property,  twisting  of  truth,  and  selective  concepts  of  freedom  and  peace.  Rabbi  Hirsch  was  right:  the  timeless  is  better  than  the  times.  Throw  tried  and  tested  principles  on  the  scrap  heap  and  (in  the  words  of  the  Psalmist)  buy  yourself  another  god,  and  all  you  have  done  is  to  become  an  idolater,  who  #/  creates  something  out  of  wood  or  stone,  says,   “You  are  my  god!”,  fools  him/herself  and  jeopar  dises  the  future  of  civilisation.

"  Churches  Cooperate  to  Provide  Chaplain  for  Deloraine  High  School   -  by  Rod  Lambert   The  local  Christian  Churches  have  continued  their  histoiy  of  cooperation  with  each  other  and  are  about  to  appoint  a  part-  time  chaplain  at  Deloraine  High.  The  appointment  is  anticipated  to  be  made  by  March  this  year  and  will  be  fully  funded   by  the  church  community  m  Deloraine,  Westbury  and  surrounding  districts.  This  will  be  the  culmination  of  a  number  of  years  of  vision  and  the  last  12  months  of  planning  and  negotiating.  The  7  denominations  represented  by  the  local  ministers'  fraternal  are  all  supporting  and  participating  in  this  project.  The  interdenominational  organisation  ""Scripture  Union  Tasmania""  will  also  be  providing  professional  and  administrative  support.  MORE  RELEVANT  In  recent  years  churches  have  turned  to  chaplaincy  as  a  more  relevant  way  than  some  of  the  older  methods  of  religious  education  of  bringing  die  Christian  faith  into  community  life.  For  instance,  there  are  over  100  chaplains  in  state  schools  in  some  of  the  mainland  states.  Did  you  also  know  that  the  Australian  cricket  team  has  its  own  chaplain,  as  do  a  number  of  AFL  teams  e.g.  Richmond,  Port  Adelaide  and  others?  Here  at  Deloraine  High,  the  person  who  will  be  appointed  as  chaplain  will  be  employed  initially  for  one  day  a  week.  The  aim  will  be  to  provide:  Spiritual  and  ethical  support  and  assistance  within  the  school  community  Communication  between  all  parts  of  the  school  community,  Christian  groups  and  other  appropriate  organisations;  and  The  credible  portrayal  of  Christian  faith  lifestyle  and  behaviour  in  the  school.   PASTORAL  CARE  &amp;  SUPPORT  Exactly  how  this  will  be  achieved  will  depend  largely  on  the  person  to  be  appointed.  His  or  her  particular  skills,  training  and  interests  will  be  taken  into  account.  Nevertheless  we  expect  that  the  chaplain  will  provide  pastoral  care  and  support  to  the  whole  school  community  -  students,  teachers  and  ancillary  staff  alike.  In  the  proposal  presented  to  and  accepted  by  the  School  Council  the  following  activities  were  seen  as  possible  ways  for  the  chaplain  to  fulfill  his  or  her  duties:  Participating  in  and  supporting  -  school  assemblies;  school  sports'  days;  school  camps;  speech  nights;  grade  meetings;  the  school  personal  development  program;  year  seven  orientation;  school  sporting  teams;  assisting  with  remedial  work  (tutoring)  and  other  student  support  programs;  visiting  students  who  are  in  hospital;  contacting  and  visiting  students  who  are  in  danger  of  dropping  out  of  school.  As  you  can  see,  the  chaplain  will  be  an  additional  resource  for  the  school,  which,  we  trust,  will  enhance  Deloraine  High's  good  reputation  even  further. ",2001-01-23

"  Opinion   N   n  TIIE  AUSTRALIAN  £  Dj  B   ijewish  News   Deafening  silence  from  the  Church   CHRISTIAN-Jewish  relations  have  come  a  long  a  way  in  recent   years.  There  have  been  earnest  efforts  on  both  sides  to  cre  ate  a  dialogue  which  addresses  concerns  and  injustices  which  are  as  old  as  the  Church  itself.   In  Australia,  Rabbis  Raymond  Apple  and  John  Levi  have  been  at  the  forefront  of  these  issues.  From  their  respective  positions  —  Rabbi  Apple  as  Senior  Rabbi  of  Sydney’s  Great  Synagogue,  and  Rabbi  Levi,  who  is  now  Rabbi  Emeritus  of  Melbourne’s  Temple  Beth  Israel  —  both  have  sought  to  represent  Jewish  interests  carefully  while  listening  to  Christian  positions.  Both  are  regarded  as  moder  ates  in  this  field,  who  do  not  speak  lightly  on  such  issues.   This  is  important  background  because  both  men  have  sounded  serious  concerns  about  the  positions  of  their  Christian  counter  parts  in  recent  months.  Rabbi  Apple,  joint  president  of  the  Australian  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews,  has  expressed  concern  at  the  failure  of  Christian  leaders  to  speak  out  against  anti-Israel  and  anti-Jewish  propaganda.  Rabbi  Levi,  a  member  of  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry’s  subcommittee  on  interfaith  relations,  raises  issues  particularly  in  regard  to  the  Uniting  Church,  which  he  described  as  “unsympathetic”.   Their  comments  are  of  increasing  concern  in  the  light  of  a  con  fluence  of  events  and  trends  in  the  Christian  world  which  are  com  bining  to  have  a  direct  effect  on  the  perception  of  Jews  and  Israel.   In  Australia,  two  new  appointments  have  significantly  raised  the  profile  of  Christian  leadership  —  the  naming  of  Anglican  Archbishop  Peter  Hollingsworth  as  Governor-General,  the  first  Church  leader  to  be  so  appointed;  while  in  the  Catholic  world,  Archbishop  George  Pell,  an  outspoken  conservative,  has  moved  from  Melbourne  to  the  more  prominent  position  of  the  Catholic  leadership  in  Sydney  and  will  be  speaking  this  month  with  Rabbi  David  Rosen,  Director  of  Inter-Faith  Relations  of  the  Israel  office  of  the  American  Jewish  Committee,  who  is  due  in  Sydney  to  speak  on   inter-faith  issues.   Internationally,  Christian-Jewish  relations  are  at  a  tense  point.  Despite  last  year’s  successful  visit  by  the  Pope  to  Israel,  interfaith  expert  Rabbi  Rosen  has  observed  that  Vatican-Israel  relations  have  declined  to  a  point  not  seen  since  before  1993.   Clearly,  the  current  decline  in  Christian  perceptions  of  Jewish  issues  is  related  to  the  broader  media  and  public  perception  of  Israel,  which  stems  in  large  measure  from  the  Palestinian  uprising.   Israel  is  currently  unfashionable.  It  has  been  painted  as  the  aggressor  in  the  seven-month  conflict  and  mythologised  as  an  oppressor.  The  Palestinian  propaganda  machine  has  worked  with  unprecedented  effectiveness  to  ensure  that  much  of  the  world  per  ceives  Palestinians  as  mere  stone-throwing  victims  and  ignores  their  guns,  mortars  and  suicide-bombers.  The  fact  that  Israeli  civil  ians  have  sustained  an  estimated  4000  attacks  since  the  current  uprising  erupted  last  September  is  swept  aside  —  as  is  the  fact  that  Israel  has  made  unprecedented  offers  in  the  pursuit  of  peace.   At  a  time  when  Israel  is  widely  derided  and  Jewish  interests   once  again  marginalised,  there  is  little  capital  for  Christian  leaders  to  stand  up  in  support  of  Jews.  It  takes  a  brave  church  leader  to  speak  out  in  a  politically  unpopular  climate.  There  are  those  who  would  argue  that  doing  just  that  marked  the  dawn  of  Christianity,  but  these  days  the  Church  is  a  social  institution  which  is  part  of  the  mainstream.  But  Church  leaders  test  the  wind  too,  and  few  apparently  see  reason  at  present  to  defend  the  Jews  if  doing  so  will  place  themselves  in  a  vulnerable  position.   It  is  extremely  disappointing  that  Australia’s  Christian  leaders  have  failed  to  speak  out  in  response  to  the  spate  of  antisemitic  inci  dents  which  have  been  perpetrated  in  Sydney  and  Canberra  in  recent  months.  Indeed,  apart  from  a  column  by  Sydney  Morning  Herald  religion  writer  Chris  McGillion  and  Sun  Herald  columnist  Sue  Williams,  where  is  the  response  from  the  media’s  editorial  writers?  Where  are  the  voices  of  tolerance  and  morality  that  we  would  rea  sonably  expect?   Silence  in  the  face  of  antisemitism  twigs  uncomfortable  memo  ries,  particularly  in  a  community  with  so  many  Holocaust  survivors  and  descendants.  Christians,  like  Jews,  believe  there  are  sins  of  omission  as  well  as  of  commission.  Silence  is  not  blameless.   Rabbi  Apple  has  commented  that  the  sympathy  he  receives  from  Christian  friends  in  private  is  not  reflected  in  their  public  com  ments.  He  points  to  ludicrous  claims  in  Arab  propaganda,  such  as  that  there  was  never  a  Jewish  Temple  on  Temple  Mount,  and  asks:  “The  most  perfunctory  reading  of  the  Bible  disproves  this;  why  doesn’t  someone  who  reads  the  Bible  stand  up  and  say  so?”   Indeed,  reading  the  Bible  is  becoming  an  uncommon  activity.  Jewish  children  tend  to  be  raised  with  enough  ritual  and  stories  to  know  the  basics.  They  learn  Exodus  between  mouthfuls  of  matzah,  the  Creation  story  in  exchange  for  a  lolly-bag  at  Simchat  Torah.  But  in  secular  Australia,  nominal  Christians  have  less  and  less  connec  tion  with  basic  texts.  Christian  leadership  is  itself  marginalised  from  mainstream  Australia  and,  in  seeking  to  reconnect,  it  looks  for  those  positions  that  strike  a  social  and  political  chord.   Joining  or  silently  accepting  the  popular  condemnation  of  Israel   and  Jews  is  a  little  too  convenient. ",2001-05-04
"  Come  all  ye  Christians   By  LCDR  Peter  Ellis   The  Military  Christian  Fellowship  of  Australia  (MCF-A)  in  Canberra  recently  invited  Mr  Tim  Fischer,  MP  to  an  all-ranks  luncheon  at  Russell  Offices.   Mr  Fischer,  former  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  talked  of  his  Dutch-German  Catholic  family  and  listed  major   influences  as  family  upbringing,  a  Jesuit  education,  three  years  in  the  Army  including  a  tour  in  Vietnam  as  a  company  commander,  and  the  NSW  State  Parliament.  Mr  Fischer's  mostly  rural  Federal  elec  torate  of  Farrer  hugs  the  NSW  side  of  the  Victorian  border  from  Albury  to  the  SA  border.  Taking  the  ANZAC  theme,  Tim  Fischer  told  of  General  Sir  Harry  Chauvel  in  WW  I  who  led  the  Desert  Mounted  Corps  to  take  the  strategically  impor  tant  Beersheba  in  October  1917.  The  attack  at  sunset  was  contrary  to  the  military  manuals  of  the  day,  and  the  surprise  attack  turned  into  a  rout  of  the  Turkish  forces.  Mr  Fischer  recalled  comments  by  a  digger  from  his  electorate  that  'once  the  horses  had  smelled  the  water  there  was  no  turning  back.'  Mr  Fischer  recently  dis  cussed  Chauvel's  life  with  the  General's  grandson  John  Mitchell  of  Towong  Station  in  Fisher's  electorate,  and  heard  how  General  Chauvel  carried  a  pocket  edi-   tion  Bible  so  he  was  never  without  its  inspiration.  Mr  Fischer  suggested  some  do  and  don't  rules  for  life,  including:  Don't  be  a  hypocrite;  assess  or  appoint  on  the  basis  of  religion;  and  collapse  if  you  fall  short  of  your  own  expectations.  Do  realise  you  are  known  by  the  good  and  bad  you  do;  and  blend  your  vocation  with  your  Christian  beliefs.  Mr  Fischer  said  that  there  were  a  great  many  Federal  politicians  who  have  a  Christian  faith,  but  they  are  politicians  first  and  Christianity  must  be  a  background  to  their  work  and  not  'worn  on  their  sleeve'.  He  said  90  per  cent  of  legislation  goes  through  supported  from  all  sides,  and  the  media  tells  only  the  controversial  things.

I  believe  that  the  belligerence  and  the  lack  of  humility  they  showed  was  both  unchristian  and  offensive  I  must  disagree,  however,  with  you  on  the  issue  of  their  right  to  be  vocal  in  this  way.  The  freedoms  you  seem  to  take  so  lightly  have  worked  since  their  inception  to  allow  minorities  a  voice.  I  believe  that  the  moment  we  attempt  to  limit  the  basic  freedoms  of  speech,  press  and  association,  we  will  silence  not  the  powerful  but  the  weak.  Yes,  that  means  that  we  must  suffer  the  positions  of  people  who  do  not  share  our  beliefs.  It  also  means  that  those  who  have  a  more  inclusive  world-view  can  actively  pursue  social  change  We  do  not  all  have  powerful  voices,  but  if  we  work  together,  the  disenfranchised  can  also  be  heard.  Use  the  freedoms  you  have  as  an  educated  member  of  a  democracy,  Mr  Golder,  and  let  us  hear  your  voice  rise  to  encourage  positive  change  rather  than  to  damage  hard  won  principles  Jackie  Keegan  #2276801  GR£ATJOB!  the  editorials  are  cool  looks  snappy  in  your  face  'and*  a  sense  of  humour  the  NUS  article  was  a  joy  to  read  C  the  closest  thing  to  a  christian  punk  rock  socialist  group  "")  please  renew  my  subscription  x  ana  soliaanty  Swinburne  urn  (vie)   [CNUmZSTTSR]   Last  Wednesday  night  I  was  walking  near  Wilson  Street  in  Newtown  when  I  was  stopped  by  3  girls  who  surrounded  me  and  asked  for  my  money.  Fortunately  I  am  a  student  and  do  not  have  any,  but  they  were  not  satisfied  with  this  and  questioned  me  until  they  heard  someone  coming,  then  they  slapped  me  on  the  back  and  let  me  go.  I  was  quite  ashamed  that  during  the  incident  I  became  a  pathetic,  weak,  shrivelled  up  little  mouse.  I  would  have  thought  I  could  at  least  act  with  a  bit  more  dignity,  instead  of  trying  to  help  them  as  much  as  I  could  so  they  would  go  away.  Then  while  I  pathetically  cried  and  shook  in  my  room  for  two  days  I  kept  thinking,  ""I'm  sure  deep  down  they  really  were  good,  I'm  sure  they  wouldn't  hurt  me  if  I  gave  them  no  reason  to,  I'm  sure  they  can  be  kind  just  like  everyone  else  ...  ""  in  short:  ""I'm  sure  people  like  that  don't  exist"".  But  they  do,  and  always  will.

A  group  of  people  in  red  shirts  bearing  small  coffins  marched  past  me  in  single  file.  When  I  asked  one  of  them  what  it  was  all  about  they  replied  ""we'  re  carrying  coffins  to  show  that  man  is  frustrated  by  death"".  I  wandered  away  a  little  bit  puzzled  by  this  cryptic  response.  Later  that  day  on  visiting  the  toilets  I  found  a  6ideons  Bible  next  to  my  wash  basin  This  added  to  my  confusion.  The  next  day  on  attending  university;  I  wandered  past  literally  thousands,  of  small  cut-out  cardboard  crosses  (that  I  think  were  meant  to  be  gravestones)  that  lined  the  main  walkway  through  UNSW.  My  immediate  thought  was  that  it  was  a  protest  from  an  animal  rightsgroup,  who  were  concerned  about  the  number  of  innocent  rodents  killed  at  UNSW  in  the  name  of  science.  As  I  neared  the  end  of  this  eerie  scene,  I  found  there  were  two  bed  sheets  on  either  side  of  the  walkway,  patterned  with  red  paint,  that  I  think  was  supposed  to  be  blood.  I  thought  to  myself  that  even  the  most  extreme  animal  welfare  group  wouldn't  have  come  up  with  something  that  stupid.  I  think  that  as  a  community  we  have  to  acknowledge  that  something  quite  scary,  and  quite  possibly  dangerous,  is  happening  at  our  university.  I  call  myself  a  Christian  and  I'm  a  little  embarrassed  to  be  associated  with  these  people.  Recently  there  was  an  article  in  Tharunka  that  criticised  Campus  Bible  Study  by  openingwith  a  quote  from  a  prominent  Russian  anarchist  that  read  ""Christianity  is  precisely  the  religion  par  excellence,  because  it  exhibits  and  manifests-impoverishment,  enslavement  and  annihilation  of  humanity  for  the  benefit  of  divinity.""  An  interesting  claim,  which  I  personally  disagree  with.  Christianity,  like  any  other  form  of  organised  religion,  has  a  number  of,faults,  but  it's  not  all  that  bad  Having  said  that,  I  can  sort  of  understand  where  the  article's  author  is  coming  from  in  light  of  recent  events.  There's  probably  not  going  to  be  a  war  at  UNSW  (but  if  CBS  keeps  ttiis  up,  I  wouldn't  be  surprised  if  there  was  some  violence).  The  fact  is  that  Campus  Bible  Study  has  a  fairly  militaristic  history  of  campaigning  at  UNSW  that  I  think  we're  all  going  to  have  to  put  up  with.  Don't  bother  starting  an  argu-  -,  ment  with  one  of  the  coffin-carriers,  because  they're  just  as  entitled  to  .  their  beliefs  as  you  or  I.  If  you  want  to  protest  against  what  they're  doing,  do  it  in  a  proper  and  organised  way  We  shouldn't  have  to  put  up  with  this  crap.  But,  as  unfortunate  as  it  seems,  we  might  just  all  have  to  put  up  with  it,  as  ""frustrating""  as  it  is.  Maybe  it'd  be  better  to  just  ignore  them  (though  that  can  be  pretty  hard  sometimes).  /   doing  yourselves  or  us  any  favors.  There's  already  a  growing  anti-CBS  backlash,  which  I  would  be  inclined  to  support.  I  think  I  speak  on  behalf  of  the  university  when  I  say  that  we've  all  had  a  gut  full.

"  Feature   Shanghai  —  a  unique  crossroads  of   Shanghai  holds  a  special  place  in  the  lives  of  many  Australian  Jews.  For  some  it  was  their   family  home  for  generations;  for  others  it  was  part  of  their  lives  in  China;  for  most,  it  was  a  place  of  refuge  from  the  Holocaust.  This   feature  by  Andrew  Jakubowscz  marks  the   opening  of  exhibitions  on  the  Jews  of  Shanghai  at  four  Sydney  museums.   JEWS  had  been  part  of  Chinese   life  since  early  in  the  Christian   era.   Jewish  traders  from  Mesopotamia  plied  the  Silk  Road  across  Asia,  with  a  major  settlement  identified  at  Kaifeng  in  Henan  early  in  the  second  Christian  millennium.   That  community  was  in  the  final  stages  of  disintegration,  its  synagogue  destroyed  in  civil  unrest  in  the  1840s,  when  the  next  Jewish  community  was  established  in  Shanghai.   David  Sassoon,  a  Baghdadi  merchant  based  in  Bombay,  opened  a  trading  house  (exporting  silver  and  tea,  importing  opium  and  textiles)  in  1845,  bringing  in  many  of  his  Sephardic  co-religionists.   They  formed  the  basis  for  the  famous  Jewish  families  of  the  city  —  Kadourie,  Ezra,  Abrahams,  Hardoun  —  and  those  who  served  in  the  religious  institutions  they  established,  such  as  the  great  Ohel  Rachel  and  the  Beth  Aharon.   The  Sephardic  Jews  followed  the  rites  of  the  Babylonian  tradition,  maintaining  links  with  the  Jewish  centres  of  Baghdad.   By  the  late  1890s,  a  new  community  appeared  in  Shanghai.  Russian  Jews  had  started  to  come  into  northern  China  when  Tsarist  Russia  gained  a  concession  for  its  Chinese  Eastern  Railway  (CER),   from  Manchouli  on  the  Siberian  border  to  Dairen  on  the  Pacific  coast.  The  concession  created  a  Russian  colony  with  extra-territorial  rights,  its  central  city  growing  out  of  the  former  fishing  village  of  Harbin.   Some  of  the  Russian  Jews  who  went  to  Harbin  and  the  other  CER  towns  such  as  Heilar,  moved  south  to  Shanghai.   The  CER  was  a  “safe  haven”  for  Jews  —  where  the  restrictions  imposed  on  them  in  the  Pale  of  Settlement  in  Russia  did  not  apply.  In  addition,  it  attracted  many  of  the  Jewish  Russian  soldiers  demobbed  after  the  defeat  of  the  Russians  by  the  Japanese  in  1905.   These  soldiers  brought  their  families  from  the  west,  and  were  joined  by  some  of  the  Siberian  families  from  cities  like  Vladivostok  in  the  wake  of  antisemitism.   While  Jews  were  not  allowed  to  work  for  the  railway,  they  provided  much  of  the  civil  infrastructure  —   food  and  drink,  hotels  (the  famous  Hotel  Modeme  built  by  Caspe)  and  banks.  They  also  worked  as  engineers,  doctors,  teachers  and  dentists.  By  the  early  1930s,  there  were  about  15,000  Jews  among  the  100,000  Russians  in  Harbin.   The  Japanese  invasion  of  Manchuria  in  1931  was  followed  by  the  Soviet  sale  of  the  CER  to  the  Manchukuo  puppet  government  in  1935.  The  invasion  created  major  changes  for  Jews;  there  were  a  series  of  kidnapping  and  murders  by  gangs  of  Chinese  criminals  linked  to  the  Japanese  secret  police  and  White  Russian  fascists.   The  Jews  began  to  leave  Harbin  —  some  for  the  international   settlement  at  Tientsin,  but  mostly  for  Shanghai.  Many,  however,  took  up  the  Soviet  invitation  to  go  back  to  the  new  Russia.  These  Harbintsy,  as  they  were  called,  were  targeted  by  Stalin  after  1937,  with  many  being  executed  as  “Japanese  spies”.   By  the  late  1930s,  there  were  over  6000  Russian  Jews  in  Shanghai,  outnumbering  the  1200  Sephardim.  There  were  many  more  White  Russians  —  Jews  and  non-Jews,  meeting  and  interacting  in  many  organisations.   For  Russian  Jews,  there  was  the  Shanghai  Jewish  Club  in  Bubbling  Well  Road,  and  for  many,  the  Shanghai  Soviet  Club.  They  also  built  their  own  Ashkenazi  synagogues  —  such  as  the  Ohel  Moishe  in  Hongkew,  a  suburb  of  Shanghai,  and  in  Rue  de  la  Tour  in  the  French  Concession.   The  initial  stage  of  antisemitism  in  Germany  (and  after  1937  in  Austria)  focused  on  the  expulsion  of  Jews  from  the  Reich.  As  the  world  closed  its  doors  to  the  refugees,  and  Britain  blocked  emigration  to  Palestine,  Shanghai  —  a  place  of  free  entry  —  became  one  of  the  few  places  that   offered  a  haven.   The  expulsion  of  Jews  (facilitated  by  Adolf  Eichmann’s  office  in  Vienna)  towards  Shanghai  also  became  increasingly  difficult  as  1939  opened.   he  international  Shanghai  Municipal  Council,  dominated  A  by  British  and  American  commercial  interests,  sought  to  halt  the  inflow  of  refugees.  The  leaders  of  the  Jewish  community  set  up  a  committee  to  assist  the  refugees,  though  they  too  were  concerned  about  the  numbers  arriving.   A  bizarre  debate  developed,  with  the  British  seeking  Japanese  military  support  (Japan  controlled  the  Chinese  city  and  Hongkew)  to  forbid  the  entry  of  the  refugees,  and  turn  them  back.  The  Nazis  pressed  the  Japanese  to  keep  Shanghai  open,  while  the  Italians  also  urged  the  Japanese  not  to  halt  the  trade  in  refugees,  who  mostly  used  Italian  shipping  lines  from  Genoa.   The  European  war  closed  off  the  sea  option  in  September  1939.  By  1942,  the  Final  Solution  ended  any  hope  of  escape  —  although  Jews  were  still  making  the  journey  from  Vienna  via  Berlin,  Warsaw  and  Moscow  to  Manchouli  and  Dairen  until  the  outbreak  of  war  between  the  USSR  and  Germany  in  mid-1941.   By  the  end  of  1941,  when  the  Pacific  War  broke  out,  there  were  18,000  Reich  refugees  in  Shanghai.   In  the  first  few  weeks  of  September  1939,  some  300,000  of  the  Jews  living  in  western  Poland  fled  east  towards  Soviet-occupied  territory.  Some  of  these  headed  for  then-independent  Lithuania,  and  found  temporary  refuge  in  the  city  of  Vilna/Vilnius,  then  a  Polish  city  with  a  large  Jewish  population.   In  mid-1940  the  Soviets  invaded  Lithuania,  and  many  Jews  sought  to  escape  again.  In  a  twist  of  fate,   The  Jewish  Balalaika  Orchestra  In  Harbin.   Japanese  Consul  Sugihara  Chiune,  who  had  come  from  Harbin,  agreed  to  provide  Japanese  transit  visas  for  those  with  entry  permits  —  to  countries  like  Haiti  or  Curacao.  In  1941  some  4000  Jews  left  Lithuania  across  Siberia.  They  included  the  whole  of  the  Yeshiva  from  Mir,  plus  many  urban  Polish  Jewish  families.   From  Vladivostok  they  sailed  to  Japan,  where  they  were  looked  after  by  the  Eastern  Jewcom,  with  support  from  the  US-based  Jewish  Joint  Distribution  Committee.  The   Japanese  expelled  the  thousand  or  so  who  could  not  get  visas  for  elsewhere  to  Shanghai  in  late  1941.   When  the  Japanese  took  control  of  Shanghai  on  December  8,  1941  there  were  about  26,000  Jews  in  the  city  —  from  wealthy  Sephardic  families  to  the  nearly-starving  refugees  in  the  slums  of  Hongkew.   The  Japanese  dealt  with  each  group  differently.  The  Japanese  Army  took  over  the  International  Settlement,  leaving  the  French  Concession  more  or  less  alone;  by   then,  France  was  under  Vichy  control  and  an  ally  of  Germany.  All  allied  nationals  were  interned  in  camps  —  a  story  told  by  Steven  Spielberg  in  Empire  of  the  Sun.   For  the  Sephardic  Jews,  the  next  40  months  would  split  families.  The  Jews  with  British  papers  (eg  bom  in  Aden  or  Hong  Kong)  were  deemed  “enemies”  and  interned.  Shanghai  born  relatives  or  those  with  other  countries’  papers  were  not  touched.   Danny  Moalem,  son  of  the  Ohel  Rachel  shamas,  was  interned  —  yet ",2001-10-19
"  nflRTH   Another  Fucked  Up  American  Organisation   by  Clio  Gates  Foale   Just  when  you  thought  it  was  safe  to  come  out  of  the  closet  along  came  yet  another  wave  of  Christian  conservatives  determined  to  save  your  soul  from  the  fiery  pit  of  hell.  It's  a  real  life  version  of  ""True  Directions:  Straight  is  Great""  from  the  film  But  I'm  a  Cheerleader,  but  where  the  film  was  a  sendup  with  a  happy  ending,  these  guys  are  serious,  and  much  more  subtle  with  their  title:  ""Love  Won  Out:  Addressing,  Understanding,  and  Preventing  Homosexuality""  is  the  latest  campaign  from  Focus  on  the  Family,  an  American  organisation  that  has  been  dedicated  to  the  conversion  of  homosexuals  for  almost  a  decade.  Apparently  far  too  many  young  people  are  coming  out  and  demanding  to  be  treated  equally,  so  now  is  the  time  to  take  action.   ""Satan  has  counterfeited  sexuality,""  says  John  Paulk,  manager  of  Focus  on  the  Family's  gender  and  homosexuality  department  and  hus-  H  band  of  a  prominent  ex-lesbian,  The  only  way  out  for  those  ""trapped  in  the  hellhole  of  sexuality,""  says  Paulk,  is  to  cast  off  their  sinful  ways  and  find  Christ.  However  adult  conversion  therapy  is  not  as  successful  as  they  were  hoping.  Paulk  himself,  who  publicly  boasts  of  being  straight  for  14  years  and  is  perhaps  the  country's  best  known  ex-gay,  was  photographed  in  a  gay  bar  last  year.  The  ""Love  Won  Out""  conference  has  been  making  its  way  around  the  country  since  1999  and  is  headed  next  to  Cincinnati,  Atlanta,  and  Orlando.  It's  focus  is  on  young  people  and  the  alarming  spread  of  homosexuality  among  teens.  For  July,  the  group  is  planning  a  protest  outside  the  National  Education  Association's  annual  conference,  where  the  nation's  largest  teachers'  group  will  be  voting  on  a  plank  that  would  recognise  the  ""complex  needs  of  gay,  lesbian,  transgender,  and  questioning  students.""  Joseph  Nicolosi,  a  psychologist  with  the  National  Association  of  Research  and  Therapy  of  Homosexuality  (NARTH),  helpfully  answered  the  question  that  concerned  parents  and  teachers  have  been  asking  for  years:  what  are  the  early  childhood  signs  of  homosexuality?  One  must  identify  the  problem  early  so  it  can  be  squashed  before  it  grows  out  of  control,  because  of  course  an  errant  sexuality  is  more  easily  stopped  early  than  reversed  later.   *r  ^  ^  V  Won  Out:  and  Addressing,  Preventing  Understanding,  Homosexuality""   National  Association  of  Research  and  Therapy  of  Homosexuality  (NARTH)   Ex-gay  men  and  women  protest  at  the  2000  American  Psychiatric  Association  Convention   The  warning  signs  of  ""pre-homosexuality,""  for  boys,  included  having  a  sensitive  temperament,  being  aesthetically  inclined,  and  responding  strongly  to  either  well,  or  badly  dressed  women.  Janelle  Hallman,  a  daintily  attired  therapist,  gave  a  parallel   Scott  Lively  helpfully  explains  what  the  gay  agenda  is  all  about:  ""I  have  long  warned  that  the  agenda  of  the  gay  movement  for  public  education  is  to  turn  schools  into  recruiting  centres  for  homosexual  activism.""   The  warning  signs  of  ""pre-homosexuality,""  for  boys,  included  having  a  sensitive  temperament,  being  aesthetically  inclined,  and  responding  strongly  to  either  well,  or  badly  dressed  women.   accounting  of  tomboy  red  flags,  which  included  wearing  army  boots.  What  to  do  with  a  fashion-obsessed  sissy  boy?  Nicolosi  recommended  corrective  nudging  toward  macho  recklessness.  When  an  audience  member  worried  that  such  an  approach  might  stifle  a  budding  artist  or  performer,  the  therapist  responded  that  a  boy  wouldn't  necessarily  have  to  give  up  piano   entirely;  he  could  simply  tickle  the  ivories  a  little  less  and  toss  the  football  a  little  more.  This  attitude  is  not  surprising  considering  the  organisation  Nicolosi  comes  from.  NARTH's  self-proclaimed  function  is  to  ""provide  psychological  understanding  of  the  cause,  treatment  and  behavior  patterns  associated  with  homosexuality.""  According  to  them  ""homosexuality  distorts  the  natural  bond  of  friendship  that  would  naturally  unite  persons  of  the  same  sex""  and  threatens  the  natural  male-female  bond  which  has  ""long  been  considered  essential  for  children.""  The  NARTH  website  boasts  a  large  collection  of  homophobic  interviews  and  testimonies  along  with  medical  evidence  to  back  it  all  up.  One  of  the  more  entertaining  medical  theories  is  finger  length  among  lesbians  and  a  link  between  left-handedness  and  homosexuality.   The  event  that  so  turned  his  stomach  was  in  fact  Diversity  Week  at  Santa  Rosa  High  School.  Lively  writes  ""The  week's  schedule  included  at  least  four  sessions  on  ""homophobia""  (defined  as  any  disagreement  with  the  social  objectives  of  the  gay  movement),  and  many  additional  hours  devoted  to  gender  issues,  transexualism  and  other  topics  dear  to  gay  activism.  While  prominent,  homosexuality  was  not  the  only  subject.  Other  sessions  featured  radical  environmentalism,  animal  rights,  veganism  and  reasons  to  hate  America.""  In  his  article  Lively  expresses  his  disgust  at  the  ""indoctrination""  of  ""prohomosexual  instruction"",  shows  his  caring  side  in  his  desire  to  ""challenge  the  blatant  sophistry  that  had  duped  these  young  minds"",  and  how  dare  we  attack  Christianity!   ""  .  .  .  the  agenda  of  the  gay  movement  f  public  education  is  to  turn  schools  into  recruiting  centres  for  homosexual  activism.""   if  you  thought  Howard  and  Pell  were  scary,  spare  a  thought  for  queers  in  America,  where  Christian  fundamentalists  continue  to  reign  and  cause  the  queer  rights  movement  to  go  hurtling  back  in  time.

"  What  the  scrolls  say  about  Christianity   Title:   The  Dead  Sea  Scrolls  and   the  Jewish  Origins  of  Christianity   Author:  Careen  Peter  Thiede   Publisner:  Lion  Publishing  2000   Reviewer:  Alan  D  Crown  AM   THERE  have  been  hundreds  of  books   and  thousands  of  articles  on  the  Dead  Sea  Scrolls.   The  focus  of  this  book  is  on  what  the  scrolls  can  say  about  the  Jewish  roots  of  Christianity.  This  raises  the  question  of  why,  when  the  scrolls  are  Jewish  docu  ments,  mostly  in  Hebrew  and  Aramaic,  they  have  been  hijacked  by  Christian  scholars  in  an  attempt  to  amplify  their  understanding  of  the  New  Testament.   The  publication  between  1922  and  1928  of  Strack-Billerbeck’s  Commentary  on  the  New  Testament  left  scholars  in  no  doubt  that  early  Christian  literature  was  an  expression  of  the  Jewish  world  in  which  Christianity  was  born,  and  early  Christian  practice  was  very  Jewish.   However,  Christian  scholars  were  not  convinced  that  Rabbinic  Judaism  was  the  same  as  in  those  days.  It  was  argued  that  Judaism  had  evolved  and  was  very  differ  ent  from  the  Judaism  that  Jesus  knew.   Jewish  scholars  were  convinced  the  New  Testament  text  had  also  evolved  and   represented  expressions  of  Christian  belief  including  anti-Pharisaic  attitudes,  which  did  not  arise  in  the  world  of  the  sages.   The  Qumran  scrolls  reconfirmed  to  Christian  scholars  that  one  must  evaluate  New  Testament  teachings  against  parallel  data  from  the  contemporary  Jewish  milieu.   Some  scholars  saw  the  scrolls  as  sec  tarian  literature  able  to  provide  only  indi  rectly  for  the  study  of  the  Jewish  world.  What  they  found  was  the  literature  of  the  Essene  sect  and  not  of  normative  Judaism.  Others  argued  that  there  was  no  such  thing  as  normative  Judaism.   The  Judaism  of  the  time  of  Christ  was  not  uniform,  but  was  the  religion  and  liter  ature  of  numerous  rival  philosophies/sects.  Only  after  the  fall  of  the  temple  and  then  the  Bar  Kochba  rebel  lion  did  Judaism  develop  a  hard  core  of   conformity,  so  that  by  Talmudic  times  there  was  a  normative  Judaism.   Yet  others  found  connections  between  Qumran  and  the  New  Testament.  The  liter  ature  on  the  New  Testament-Qumran  con  nection  multiplied  in  the  first  three  decades  of  Qumran  studies.  Some  of  this  literature  has  reached  extreme  conclu  sions  based  on  interpretations  of  the  pesharim  among  the  scrolls.  Tales  have  been  fabricated  about  the  alleged  life  of   Jesus  after  his  crucifixion.   Scholars  have  suggested  that  the  attempt  to  draw  any  nexus  between  Qum  ran  and  Christianity  should  be  abandoned.  The  Qumran  literature  is  seen  to  be  very  Jewish:  its  study  should  be  back  on  the  agenda  for  the  purposes  of  the  amplifica  tion  of  the  Second  Temple  period  in  a  strictly  Jewish  sense.   It  is  unusual  to  find  a  book  that  still  sees  in  the  scrolls  New  Testament  documents  drawing  their  inspiration  from  Essene  teachings.  In  that  respect,  this  book  is  a  throwback  to  the  1960s  and  70s.   It  takes  no  notice  of  the  revision  of  the  latest  date  for  the  scrolls  to  circa  63BCE  (or  57BCE).  This  would  make  it  improbable  for  any  portion  of  the  New  Testament  to  be  found  therein  unless  one  revises  by  a  cen  tury  the  dates  of  Jesus  and  the  New  Testa  ment.  Alternatively,  the  New  Testament  incorporated  pre-existing  Jewish  texts,  which  were  prepared  for  the  mass  of  the  Jewish  people  before  Christianity  was  born  and  which  were  subsumed  to  the  New  Testament  and  given  a  Christian  iden  tity.   To  some  extent,  this  is  the  conclusion  reached  by  the  author  in  his  argument  that  there  are  passages  in  the  Qumran  scrolls  which  are  highly  significant  for  New  Testa  ment  study  as  they  can  be  recognised  as  the  “groundwork”  of  the  first  Christian  library,  the  later  New  Testament.   If  we  are  to  accept  this  conclusion,  there  is  strong  proof  here  that  Christianity  is  more  deeply  grounded  in  Judaism  than  many  Christians  would  want  to  admit.

"  School  appoints  inaugural  leader   PORT  Lincoln's  proposed  first  nondenominational  school  has  moved  one  step  closer  to  reality  with  the  appointment  of  a  principal  last  week.

"  Taliban  to  execute  Aussie  Christians:   Few  complaints  back  home   KABUL,  Sunday:  Plans  by  Afghanistan's  ruling  Taliban  to  execute  two  Australian  evangelists  have  met  with  little  resistance  back  home.   The  likely  painful  torture  and  murder  of  two  Christians  has  been  viewed  in  Australia  with  a  mixture  of  indifference  and  quiet  support.  Diplomats  have  affirmed  that  there  has  been  very  little  pressure  on  them  to  negotiate  the  pair's  release.  The  missionaries  have  made  a  last  ditch  attempt  to  get  the  charges  of  preaching  Christianity  dropped  by  offering  the  Taliban  leaders  ""Christ's  salvation""  if  they  let  them  go.   Australian  Diana  Thomas  and  Peter  Bunch  were  arrested  by  the  Taliban,  who  objected  to  the  pair's  fanatical  religious  zealotry.  The  two  missionaries  believed  the  Afghans  would  be  less  oppressed  by  following  the  strict  fundamentalism  of  Christianity  than  the  strict  fundamentalism  of  Islam.  The  Taliban  was  able  to  identify  them  as  Christian  evangelists  by  their  numerous  bibles  and  poor  fashion  sense.  The  aid  workers  were  arrested  after  they  were  found  with  6,000  Bibles,  Christian  videos  and  Amy  Grant  CDs  in  the  local  Dari  language.   Both  prisoners  have  repeatedly  proclaimed  their  innocence  to  charges  of  proselytizing,  insisting  that  the  Afghan-translated  bibles  were  for  their  own  personal  use.  They  were  however  found  guilty  on  the  more  serious  charge  of  listening  to  Amy  Grant.The  trafficking  of  holy  Christian  scripture  is  regarded  as  a  highly  serious  offence  in  Afghanistan,  where  sniffer  dogs  now  patrol  the  country's  borders,  checking  for  illicit  gospels.  Many  Christians  have  been  known  to  smuggle  the  Good  News  in  by  concealing  it  up  their  arse,  from  where  it's  still  easily  read  by  most  of  its  believers.

He  abandoned  his  prepared  text  in  favour  of  a  forthright  and  eloquent  off-the-cuff  overview  of  Christianity’s  historic  antisemitism,  the  revolutionary  change  in  its  view  of  Jews  and  the  need  for  a  positive  response  from  the  Jewish  world.   “The  Christians  have  forgotten  about  the  past,”  he  saiid,  “and  the  jews  don’t  know  much  about  the  present.”   Addressing  an  audience  of  600,  including  Archbishop  Pell,  Rabbi   Rosen  focused  on  the  need  for  Christians  of  all  denominations  to  internalise  the  message  of  Pope,Paul  Vi’s  Nostra  Aetate  —  the  1965  declaration  that  discarded  the   dogma  of  Jews  as  the  “murderers  of  God”,  condemned  antisemitism  and  accepted  God’s  continuing  Covenant  with  the  Jewish  people.   “In  looking  at  this  remarkable  transformation,  we  confront  the  first  challenge  of  the  new  millennium  for  the  Christian  partners  in  the  dialogue  [with  Jews],”  he  said.  “These  positions  [in  Nostra  Aetate]  are  not  adequately  known  throughout  the  Christian  world,  they  are  not  adequately  adopted  and  certainly  not  adequately   transmitted.”   While  most  churches  had  recognised  the  eternal  validity  of  the  Covenant  and  considered  it  to  be  incompatible  with  coercive  proselytising  of  Jews,  there  were  still  “plenty  of  places”  where  this  activity  was  endorsed,  he  said.   “Even  in  Australia  you  have  segments,  despite  the  fact  that  the  Archbishop  of  Canterbury  [the  spiritual  head  of  the  Church  of  England]  refused  to  give  his  own  position  of  authority  to  the  so-called  mission  to  the  Jews  of  the  Anglican  communion,  and  has  categorically  stated  that  ‘When  I  meet  with  my  Jewish  brothers  and  sisters  I  recognise  them  as  covenanted  with  God  and  most  loved  by  Him’.  There  are  still  those  who  have  not  understood  the  implications  of  what   Continued  page  28   Rabbi  David  Rosen  delivers  the  B’nal  B’rith  Human  Rights  Oration  In   Sydney  this  week.  Photo:  Amelia  Whitaker   Rabbi,  Archbishop  condemn  proselytising   Continued  from  page  1   that  means  .”   Rabbi  Rosen  did  not  specifically  mention  the  activities  of  the  Sydney  Diocese  of  the  Anglican  Church,  whose  support  for  evangelical  groups  -r-puch  as  Kehilat  Hamashiach  in  St  Ives,  which  is   led  by  an  apostate  Jew,  has  been  a  thorn  in  the  side  of  intercommunal  relations  for  years.  The  diocese’s  stance  is  not  expected  to  change  in  the  short  term,  despite  next  month’s  election  of  a  new  Anglican  archbishop  to  replace  Harry   Goodhew.   Rabbi  Rosen:  “Jews  will  find  it  difficult  to  take  seriously  the  claim  of  a  new,  genuine  relationship  of  mutual  respect  recognising  the  Divine  Covenant  with  Jewry  if  there  is  not  a  clear  rejection  of  the  intrusive  proselytisation  aimed  at  the  Jewish  community.”   Australia’s  leading  Anglican,  Archbishop  n  Camley,  not  only  agreed  with  Rabbi  Rosen,  but   directly  criticised  the  Sydney  diocese.   Speaking  from  Perth,  he  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News:  “They  have  it  in  for  anyone  who  doesn’t  think  like  they  think.  They  would  like  to  convert  even  other  Anglicans  to  their  viewpoint.  It’s  a  broader  issue  than  just  Jews.”   Emphasising  the  radical  change  in  Christian  attitudes  over  the  past  30  years,  Rabbi  Rosen  said  the  sincerity  of  that  change  had  been  doubted  by  many  Jews  until  the  Vatican  established  diplomatic  relations  with  Israel  in  ^  *1993  —  the  result  of  negotiations  in  which  he   played  a  pivotal  role.   He  praised  the  Pope  for  his  commitment  to  Christian-Jewish  reconciliation,  particularly  the  visible  evidence  he  had  given  of  the  Catholic  position  through  his  public  acts.  The  Pope’s   visit  to  Israel  saw  him  at  Yad  Vashem  “in  tearful  solidarity  with  Jewish  suffering”,  and  his  meeting  with  Israel’s  President  was  a  far  cry  from  Pope  Pius  X’s  warning  to  Theodore  Herzl  that  Jews  returning  to  their  homeland  would  be  greeted  by  priests  ready  to  baptise  them.   Rabbi  Rosen  described  Israel  as  the  lodestar  by  which  Jews  measured  the  attitudes  of  the  Christian  world.  He  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  he  supported  “unreservedly”  the  call  by  Australian  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  joint  president  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  on  the  churches  to  speak  out  against  Arab  propaganda  that  spread  lies  about  Judaism  and  Israel.   He  accepted  that  the  churches  were  in  a  complicated  situation  because  many  Palestinian  Arabs  were  Christian,  but  noted  that  bishops  in  the  US  had  condemned  false  claims,  such  as  denial  of  the  existence  of  the  Jewish  Temples  on  the  Temple  Mount.  “The  politically  sensitive  situation  cannot  allow  historical  perversion  and  defamation  to  go  unchecked,”  he  said.   During  the  oration,  however,  he  called  on  Jews  to  respond  to  changes  in  the  Christian  world.  “The  fact  of  [Christianity’s]  transformation  makes  dramatic  challenges  of  the  Jewish  community.  The  Jewish  community  does  not  fully  understand,  let  alone  appreciate,  what  a  dramatic  transformation  has  taken  place,  does  not  understand  anywhere  near  yet  adequately  that  the  Christian  world  abounds  today  with  persons  who  are  genuinely  friends  and  allies  of  the  Jewish  people.   “All  too  often,  we  indulge  in  precisely  the  sins  of  which  we  were  the  victims  —  namely,  the  failure  to  distinguish  between  different  communities,  between  different  approaches  within  those  communities  that  distinguish  those   still  of  the  mind  of  yore  and  those  who  have  adopted  ...  the  implications  of  the  new  relationship  with  the  Jewish  people.   “Surely  this  transformation  calls  us  to  an  examination  which  for  many  is  perhaps  still  too  early  and  too  difficult  to  engage  in.  But  this  is  the  challenge  for  the  Jewish  people,  the  Jewish  partners  in  this  relationship  in  the  new  millennium  ahead—for  us  to  engage  in  our  own  theological  understanding  of  what  this  means.”   Despite  differences  between  the  two  religions,  Rabbi  Rosen  concluded  that  the  values  rooted  in  their  shared  scriptural  heritage  was  not  only  sufficient  for  common  action  in  facing  moral  challenges,  but  made  it  obligatory.   “This  is  the  most  obvious  challenge  for  Jewish-Christian  relations  in  the  new  millennium  —  the  challenge  to  be  able  to  provide  from  the  wisdom,  not  only  of  our  separate  traditions,  but  to  be  able  to  provide  from  that  which  we  share  as  guidance  for  the  world  in  which  we  live.”   Archbishop  Clarney:  “This  is  the  time  for  major  faiths  to  be  in  dialogue,  rather  than  in  competition.  We  have  more  in  common  than  our  secularised  neighbours,  who  have  no  belief  in  God  at  all.  If  anybody  needs  prosyletising,  it’s  the  completely  atheistic  secular  world.”   The  Sydney  Morning  Herald  reported  that  at  a  meeting  at  Mandelbaum  House  after  the  oration,  Archbishop  Pell  had  noted  areas  in  which  Jews  and  Christians  may  be  able  to  “co-operate  effectively”,  such  as  defending  and  promoting  belief  in  God  and  stressing  “the  blessings  that  are  children  and...  importance  of  motherhood”.   Rabbi  Rosen  was  brought  to  Australia  by  the  Australian  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  in  conjunction  with  the  B’nai  B’rith  Anti   Defamation  Commission. ",2001-05-18
"  shITe   Websites  so  bad  you  have  to  visit,  with  Andrew  Hansen.   Visionaries  -  Part  2   A  couple  of  issues  ago  we  had  a  quick  dip  into  the  vast  cesspool  of  webshites  that  managed  to  get  themselves  a  generic  domain  name  back  in  1991  or  whenever  it  was.  We  saw  www.good.com,  www.beer.com,  as  well  as  www.money.com,  and  www.interestlng.com,  along  with  a  few  others.   So  choice  were  those  nuggets,  and  so  few  were  Chaser  readers'  recommendations  this  fortnight,  I  feel  we  should  check  out  some  more.  Let's  go:  www.christ.com  has  not  webmasters  who  created  it,  but  'Christian  Webservants'.  Religious  webshites  are  always  good  for  a  laugh,  or  at  least  a  dry  smirk,  and  christ.com  is  no  exception.  Online  Christ  offers  a  'Bible  verse  of  the  day'  with  instructions  for  putting  it  on  your  own  website,  a  'Churchnews'  section,  a  'Today's  study'  section,  and  even  a  course  in  learning  Biblical  Greek.  The  Earth  is  the  Lord's,  and  the  fulness  thereof;   christ.com  -  God's  greatness  does  not  extend  to  web  design.  Cop  the  introduction  to  your  Greek  course.  It's  honestly  written  by  someone  named  Job:  Welcome  to  our  new  section  on  Biblical  Greek!  Our  first  lesson  is  a  big  one.  The  first  task  is  to  install  the  Greek  fonts  on  your  computer.  This  will  probably  take  anywhere  from  a  few  minutes,  to  a  couple  of  weeks,  depending  on  your  computer  background.  The  link  to  install  the  Greek  fonts  is  listed  below.  The  next  task  is  to  memorize  the  Greek  alphabet  and  pronunciation  guide.  The  last  task  is  optional:  acquire  a  few  good  books  on  Greek  grammar,  a  Greek  lexicon,  and  a  Greek  concordance.  God  bless  you,  and  I  pray  that  studying  God's  Word  in  the  original  language  will  be  a  blessing  to  you.  Yours  in  Christ.  Job.  Over  in  the  Shopping  section,  you'll  find  a  link  to  the  Net's  most  stomach-turning  cavalcade  of  Christian  capitalism,  shopping.crosswalk.com.  The  folks  at  crosswalk.com  have  over  40  categories  of  Christian  consumer  items  to  choose  from,  including  Abundant  Living,  Bible  Study  Guides,  Christian  Jewellery,  Electronics  &amp;  Gadgets,  Holidays,  Prayer  Resources,  Teens,  Toys,  and  Web  Addresses.  Several  of  those  links  take  you  straight  to  a  regular  shopping  site,  such  as  amazon.com,  so  that  crosswalk.com  can  pick  up  advertising  money  through  your  clicks.  God  approves  heartily  of  this  deceptive  commerce.  The  'Web  Addresses'  link  is  perhaps  the  most  astounding.  Want  a  website  for  'your  family?'  (Apply  Californian  accent  here.)

An  animated  advertisement  shows  a  cute  boy  and  girl,  both  white,  beaming  as  they  sit  at  a  computer.  'Our  mom  got  us  our  own  domain  name,'  they  say.  'Now  we  can  build  our  own  website!'  Also,  you  mustn't  miss  the  chance  to  get  your  degree  at  Master's  Divinity  School  -  your  education  will  take  place  entirely  online  at  www.mdlvs.org.  Back  to  the  generic  domain  names.  www.stocks.com  is  a  vastly  confusing  bunch  of  links  to  stockmarket  sites.  Meanwhile,  www.stockmarket.com  has  recently  become  www.stockmarket-casino.com  -  almost  impossible  to  believe,  but  it's  genuinely  an  online  casino  named  after  the  stockmarket.  'Are  you  a  player?'  runs  their  slogan.  Hover  your  pointer  over  the  list  of  games  and  the  text  'All  your  favorite  Casino  Games!'  pops  up.  Go  from  broker  to  broke.  You  might  like  to  head  straight  from  here  to  presumably  the  biggest  bank  on  the  net,  www.bank.com,  which  'searches  the  web  looking  for  the  best  providers  of  financial  products,  saving  you  time  and  money  as  you  manage  your  financial  world.'  bank.com  features  a  Deposit  Center  (yes,  Center),  Loan  Center,  Mortgage  Center,  Insurance  Center,  and  Small  Business  Center.  Each  'Center'  is  just  a  link  to  some  other  site  belonging  to  one  American  financial  institution  or  another.  Bank.com  is  nothing  more  than  an  index  that  gets  paid  by  the  other  sites  for  your  clicks  through  to  them.  Each  and  every  one  of  these  other  webshites  is  extraordinarily  boring  and  irrelevant  to  all  Australians,  so  let's  move  on.  www.muslc.com  is  a  perfectly  normal,  respectable  site  for  downloading  and  buying  music.  It  has  no  place  in  shITe.  www.televlslon.com,  on  the  other  hand,  is  perfectly  welcome  in  this  column.  Television.com  is  'the  definitive  destination  for  all  things  television-related.'  A  sort  of  shrine  to  the  worst  things  ever  created  by  the  human  race.  television.com  can  help  you  to  buy  a  TV  tuner  card  that  will  enable  you  to  watch  TV  on  your  computer  while  surfing  at  the  same  time.  Just  like  Apple  Macs  could  do  about  seven  years  ago.  However,  Television.com  doesn't  sell  lengths  of  rope  with  which  to  hang  yourself,  as  that  would  be  much  cheaper.  You  can  also  watch  TV  shows  on  the  site  using  just  your  regular  RealPlayer.  I  tried  to  watch  a  programme  made  in  India  called  Learn  to  Trade,  and  received  a  'File  not  found'  error.  I  didn't  persist. ",2001-07-09

"  Schools  are  children   Schools  without  children  are  peaceful  refuges,  but  schools  without  children  are  not  schools  at  all.  Schools  are  children.  Schools  should  not  exist  for  the  sake  of  staff,  or  for  the  sake  of  school  councils  and  not  even  for  the  'good  name'  of  the  school.  They  should  exists  to  help  children  make  the  most  of  the  gifts  and  talents  God  has  given  them  and  to  help  each  child  reach  his/her  full  potential.  Every  child,  in  every  class,  in  every  school  deserves  to  feel  important.  At  River  City  Christian  College  children  do  feel  important  and  worthwhile  as  individuals  because  the  school  is  small  enough  to  be  personal,  yet  large  enough  to  provide  the  essentials  for  good  education.  Children  feel  important  at  River  City  because  the  school  ensures  that  children  really  do  come  first.  The  atmosphere  is  student  orientate,  the  curriculum  is  centred  around  the  needs  of  students,  and  all  staff  work  hard  to  provide  a  caring  Christian  environment   with  positive,  personal  motivation,  for  every  child.  That  is  why  it  is  called  'personalised'  education.  'Personalised*  education  starts  with  thinking  of  the  needs  of  all  children  at  the  planning  stage.  Children's  needs  have  constantly  been  borne  in  mind  as  the  school  has  grown  and  planned  for  the  future.  The  new  science  and  home  economics  facilities  are  providing  more  flexibility  and  wider  options  for  students,  particularly  practical  students.  Numeracy  and  literacy  are  so  important,  staff  believe  that  every  student  should  have  a  tailor  made  personal  program  so  that  he/she  can  work  at  his/her  own  level  and  progress  at  his/her  own  speed  in  both  numeracy  (maths)  and  literacy  (English/  spelling).  The  personalised  approach  ensures  real  learning  takes  place.  Students  do  not  move  on  having  only  half-learnt  important  concepts.  Students  cannot  finish  a  year  with  learning  gaps.  Personalised  education  means  choice.  A  wide  choice  of  face-toface  subjects  helps  students  to   mature  spiritually,  to  develop  as  a  person  and  to  grow  socially,  thus  equipping  them  for  life  in  modern  Australian  society.  The  right  staff  are  very  important  if  personalised  education  is  to  be  successful.  The  staff  at  River  City  undertake  additional  training  to  help  them  understand  the  individual  needs  of  students  and  the  implementation  of  the  personalised  education  program.  The  school  atmosphere  and  environment  at  River  City  places  students  first.  Staff  respect  students,  students  respect  staff  and  students  respect  each  other.  At  River  City,  the  playground  as  well  as  the  classroom  is  Christianity  in  action.  Students  are  encouraged  in  their  Christian  faith  and  they  feel  secure  and  accepted  as  people  of  worth  to  God  and  to  people  around  them.  Students  have  freedom  to  develop  leadership  skills  in  a  caring  family  atmosphere,  and  this  same  atmosphere  encourages  students  from  the  youngest  prep  to  the  oldest  secondary,  to  be  responsible  for  the  other.

"  25  to  January  28   Sacred  input;   SOME  sacred  entertainment  will  come.this  way  for  Tunarama.  Sacred  Stone  is  a  five-piece  outfit  from  Adelaide.  The  band  includes  Leana  Cummings  on  lead  vocals,   Jeromy  Green  on  bass,  Mick  Raymondo  on  drums  and  Adrian  Blenkinsop  and  JR  on  guitars.  Sacred  Stone  will  feature  at  the  foreshore  jetty  car  park  at  The  Edge  youth  event  on  Friday  and  Saturday  nights  from  9pm  to  lam.  Sacred  Stone's  CD  Fall  was  received  enthusiastically  by  Christian  radio  stations  across  Australia,  gaining  high  rotation  airplay,  and  in  1998  the  band  won  the  Battle  of  the  Unsigned  Bands  award  on  the  national  Austereo  Radio  Network.  The  band  lias  the  technology,'  and  aside  from  the  crisp,  clear  studio  smarts,  they  have  cornered  the  market  on  ponderous  music.  The  haze-inducing  guitars  and  keyboards  in  Don't  Look  Tb  Me  belie  the  band's  up-to-the-minute  vibes  and  addiction  to  simple  melody  -  low,  mellow  rapping  and  layered  dance  choruses  with  a  street-credible  feel,  downplay  the  song's  social  shunting.  Such  spiels  as  Looking  Sideways  point  to  the  band's  mission  statement:  To  present  young  people  with  the  Christian  message  in  a  positive  and  relevant  way,  encouraging  them  to  find  hope  and  purpose  in  their  lives  through  a  relationship  with  Jesus  Christ.""  Their  rewritten  cover  of  Respect  Yourself  has  a  gritty  personality  which  rambles  along  on  an  underbelly  of  funk  -  a  sound  that  wouldn't  have  appeared  unusual  from  INXS  in  their  heyday.  Then,  the  band's  own  More  Than  Ever  sounds  comfortably  funky  and  authentically  Australian  in  its  urging  conveyance.  The  messages  are  not  for  everyone  but  Sacred  Stone's  music  has  scope  only  half  unveiled.  As  part  of  EP  Alive's  Bridging  the  Gap  program,  Sacred  Stone  will  offer  music  and  dance  workshops  over  the  Tunarama  weekend.

"  Stefan  Bialoguski   CHRISTIANS  need  to  repent  for  their  antisemitic  heritage,  the  Anglican  Archbishop  of  Sydney,  Dr  Peter  Jensen,  has  declared.   “We  need  to  repent  of  antisemitism”  is  the  title  of  an  article  by  the  archbishop  in  the  Anglican  magazine  Southern  Cross.   In  it  he  recognises  centuries  of  Christian  maltreatment  of  Jews,  condemns  Holocaust  denial,  and  cautions  against  “abuse  and  misunderstanding”  of  New  Testament  passages  to  vilify  the  Jewish  people.   “We  Christians  must   learn  to  extend  our  love   to  the  Jewish  people,”  he  said.  “In  particular,  we  must  be  in  the  forefront  of  those  who  condemn  any  attacks  on  Jewish  schools,  synagogues  and  places  of  business,  such  as  those  that  have  occurred  in  our  city  in  the  last  two  years.”   The  article  has  been  welcomed  as  signifying  a  sea-change  for  the  conservative  archbishop   Archbishop  Dr  Peter  Jensen   who,  as  the  previous  principal  of  Moore  Theological  College,  sometimes  had  strained  relations  with  the  Jewish  community,  particularly  on  the  issue  of  proselytising.   NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  past  president  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  —  who  has  decried  the  silence  of  Christian  and  Muslim  leaders  concerning  the  upsurge  in  antisemitic  incidents  in  Australia  over  the  past  14  months  —  welcomed  the  archbishop’s  article  as  a  “valuable  statement  issued  at  the  right  time”.   However,  he  regretted  Dr  Jensen’s  implicit  insistence  that  proselytising  should  continue  as  an  “unfortunate  sting  in  the  tail”.   The  archbishop  wrote  that  “the  discussion  between  Jews  and  Christians  about  God’s   plan  to  bring  us  together  into  the  same  fold   must  continue”.   Rabbi  Apple:  “One  would  have  hoped  that  just  as  we  respect  his  right  to  his  own  conscience  and  convictions,  he  would  acknowledge  and  respect  ours.”   The  archbishop  singled  out  the  Holocaust  as  “the  most  shocking  event  of  [the  20th]  century”  and  “an  unprecedented  act  of  evil”.   “We  must  be  aware,”  he  wrote,  “that  the  attitudes  and  activities  which  helped  to  create  the  Holocaust  are  still  to  be  found  close  at  hand,  even  at  times,  within  our  own  sinful  hearts  —  and  in  our  Christian  churches.”   Anglicans  had  inherited  the  history  of  the  Church  of  England,  which  country  treated  its  Jews  “little  better  than  the  rest  of  Europe”.   “The  tendency  within  us  all  to  sinful  racist  attitudes  has  especially  been  evident  by  Christians  towards  their  Jewish  neighbours   over  the  centuries  ...  We  must  be  numbered   among  antisemitism’s  chief  opponents.”   Contacted  by  the  Australian  Jewish  News,  the  archbishop  declined  to  comment  on  his  continued  support  for  missionising.   Welcoming  the  statement,  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman  said:  “It’s  an  excellent  starting-point  from  which  to  build  a  relationship  of  mutual  respect  and  understanding.   “I’d  rather  take  the  statement  at  face  value  and  recognise  that  it  brings  the  archdiocese  of  Sydney  into  line  with  what  is  our  improving  relationship  with  the  Anglican  Church  and  its  counterparts  elsewhere  in  the  world.”   Archbishop  Jensen  wrote  the  article  in  response  to  an  invitation  by  the  Evangelical  Sisterhood  of  Mary  to  attend  a  service  of  repentance  this  month  for  2000  years  of   Christian  antisemitism.   He  did  not  attend  the  service,  officially  because  of  a  prior  engagement.  Held  at  the  University  of  NSW,  the  service  attracted  about  800  people  (report,  next  week).

"  Candid  account,  unflinching  approach   Title:  The  Devil’s  Greed:  Twelve   Million  Eyes  and  Trillions  of   Tears   Author.  Harry  J  Fransman   Publisher:  Self  Published,  Sydney  2000.   Reviewer:  Ben  Haneman   WITH  an  enigmatic  title,  with  material   perhaps  not  directly  related  to  the  Holocaust,  and  even  with  a  stumble  on  the  issue  of  Nazi  manufacture  of  soap  from  human  bodies,  this  is  a  mighty  book  which  takes  an  honourable  place  besides  the  many  other  books  written  by  Holocaust  sur   vivors.   This  book  stands  out  in  three  areas:  First  there  are  the  detailed,  graphic  descriptions  of  the  horrors  to  which  the  prisoners  were  subjected.   One  admires  the  photographic  memory  of  the  author.  No  doubt  the  events  have  etched  an  indelible  record  in  his  memory.  Throughout  the  book,  we  have  the  over  whelming  impression  that  this  is  how  it  was.  Vicariously,  we,  too,  suffer  the  atrocities  and  the  indignities.  Harry  Fransman  is  absolutely  candid,  and  I  have  faith  in  his  veracity.   The  second  point  is  that  the  book  focuses  on  the  Dutch  experience.  The  author  lived  through  the  hellish  bombardment  of  Rotterdam,  a  characteristic  example  of  German  schrecklichkeit  and  aggression.  He  survived  the  bombardment,  but  narrowly,  and  so  is  able  to  describe  an  event  we  know  happened,  but  of  which  we  had  only  sketchy   details.   Dutch  Jewry,  unlike  Polish  Jewry,  had  vir  tually  no  experience  of  antisemitism  and  lived  in  great  amity  with  their  Christian  neighbours.  It  is  true  that  there  was  a  treach  erous  pro-Hitler  Dutch  party,  the  NSB,  and   some  of  the  Jews’  gentle  Gentile  neighbours  later  revealed  the  hate  that  had  been  hiding  in  their  hearts.  What  happened  to  Dutch  Jewry  —  more  than  100,000  destroyed  —  was  no  less  tragic  than  what  happened  to  Polish  Jewry,  but  in  a  sense,  dare  I  say  it,  arguably  even  more  poignant.   I  will  not  dwell  on  the  day-to-day  occur  rences  in  the  camps,  as  reported  by  Mr  Fransman.  We  read  this  type  of  material  again  and  again,  often  with  reluctance,  but   we  have  a  sacred  duty  to  go  on  reading  and  remembering,  not  only  for  the  Jewish  peo  ple,  but  for  the  family  of  nations.   The  book  describes  the  events  as  libera  tion  was  occurring.  I  did  not  appreciate  that  Holland  was  not  liberated  totally  at  once.  Also  of  interest  is  a  frank  account  of  the  return  of  sexual  desire  once  the  victims  were  out  of  the  jaws  of  hell.   The  third  area  where  this  book  is  out  standing  is  the  author’s  courageous  and  unflinching  approach  to  Christian  culpabili  ty.  Not  all  Christians  behaved  as  beasts  and,  of  course,  there  were  individual  acts  of  kind  ness.  The  noteworthiness  of  these  humane  actions  highlights  the  terrible  overall  defi  ciencies  of  Christian  compassion  in  general.  Who  can  forget  accounts  of  Christian  Nazis  crossing  themselves  before  they  murdered?   Interfaith  dialogue  is  fine,  but  the  memory  of  what  happened  is  hard  to  erase.  In  those  years  Christianity  again  dropped  its  mask  of  charity.  It  is  hard  to  forget  the  face  we  saw   revealed.   Mr  Fransman  seems  harder  on  the  Roman  Catholics  than  on  the  Lutherans.  I  think  it  was  a  close  run  contest  between  the  two   confessions.  I  can  never  forget  the  English  Anglican  primate  who  said  that  if  Nazi  atroc  ities  continued,  “it  would  put  an  almost  intol  erable  strain  on  our  friendship”.  Apparently  what  he  was  saying  was  “kill  Jews  by  all  means,  but  do  it  quietly!”   I  started  by  saying  that  the  book  is  not  per  fect.  Who  is?  So  I’ll  finish  by  saying  it  is  a  powerful  and  valuable  addition  to  Holocaust  literature.   S3  Ben  Haneman  is  a  consultant  physician  and  Sydney  reviewer. ",2001-11-23

"  ?   A  SURE  sign  the  tuna  farming  season  is  about  to  begin  is  the  arrival  of  frozen  feed  fish  from  overseas.  The  bulk  carrier  EW  Everest  docked  at  the  wharf  last  week  with  6300  tonnes  of  frozen  herring  from  the  Swedish  port  of  Walhamn.  It  took  the  stevedores  more  than  a  week  of  10-hour  days  to  unload  the  8400  pallets  of  frozen  fish.  .  Agritrade  managing  director  Christian  Huntington  said  Ids  company  had  brought  fish  to  Port  Lincoln  since  tuna  farming  began,  but  each  year  the  loads  increased  with  this  year's  load  up  on  last  year  by  25  per  cent.  Mr  Huntington  said  the  load  would  meet  about  10  per  cent  of  the  tuna  farm's  requirements.  The  herring  had  a  high  fat  and  protein  content,  which  made  them  perfect  for  diversifying  the  tuna's  diet.  Other  imported  fish  such  as  pilchards  from  North  America  would  arrive  in  shipping  containers  during  the  season,  but  not  in  such  a  large  quantity  as  Agritrade's  single  delivery.   •  Agritrade's  Christian  Huntington  (right)  with  logistics  company  Power  House  supervisors  John  Fahlbusch  and  Janet  Haley  and  a  pallet  of  frozen  herring  from  Sweden.

"  US  ambassador  sought  comfort  at  Canberra’s  Jewish  Centre   Bernard  FMman   NEW  Yorker  Gary  Fellman  was  con  ducting  his  fortnightly  adult  educa  tion  class  on  Judaism  at  Canberra’s   National  Jewish  Centre  last  Sunday  week,  when  an  unexpected  guest   arrived.   American  Ambassador  Tom  Schi  effer,  just  back  from  Washington  where  he  had  witnessed  the  terrorist  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Centre  and  the  Pentagon,  had  come  to  the  centre  with  his  wife  and  son.   As  he  later  told  a  service  of  com  memoration  and  thanksgiving  attended  by  more  than  2,000  people  at  Parliament  House,  Mr  Schieffer  went  to  the  Jewish  Centre  to  seek  comfort  from  a  “higher  being”  in  the  aftermath  of  the  attacks  in  America,  which  claimed  more  than  6,000  lives.   At  the  centre,  Mr  Schieffer  was  served  a  bagel  and  lox  and  apple  and  honey  to  mark  Rosh  Hashanah.  He  described  his  experience  in  Washing  ton  where  he  was  present  during  the  visit  of  Prime  Minister  John  Howard,  telling  the  group  he  had  called  on  Mr  Howard  who  had  been  moved  to  secure  quarters  in  the  Australian  Embassy  after  the  hijacked  aircraft  smashed  into  the  Pentagon.   The  ambassador,  who  spent  about  45  minutes  at  the  centre,  also  visited  the  cheder  which  was  in  progress.   At  the  interdenominational  service   US  Ambassador  Tom  Schleffer,  his  wife  Suzanne,  and  Drs  Alan  and  Anita  Shroot  at  the  Canberra  Jewish  Centre  several  days  after  the  terrorist  bombings  in  America.   at  Parliament  House  attended  by  Gov  ernor-General  Peter  Hollingworth,  the  prime  minister,  Opposition  leader  Kim  Beazley,  parliamentarians,  diplo   “No  Christian,  no  Jew,  no  Muslim  would  have   done  such  a  thing.”   Tom  Schieffer,  US  ambassador   mats  and  members  of  the  public,  Mr  Shieffer  talked  of  why  he  had  visited  the  Jewish  Centre,  attended  a  Catholic  mass,  an  Anglican  service   and  visited  with  the  imam  of  the  Can  berra  mosque  last  Sunday.   “I  am  a  Presbyterian  by  faith,”  he  said.  “But  I  felt  as  the  American  ambassador  it  was  important  to  remember  that  God  is  worshipped  in  many  places  and  in  many  ways.   “In  each  place  I  felt  the  presence  of  God.  In  each  place  I  looked  into  the  faces  of  men  and  women  who  shared  our  pain  ...  at  the  monstrous  acts  that  have  been  committed.   “It  is  important  for  all  of  us  to  remember  that,  just  as  Hitler  was  no  Christian,  those  who  committed  these  horrible  acts  were  not  men  and  women  of  faith.

"  Christian  group  claims  menorah   TWO-and-a-half  years  after  Canada’s  trademark  reg  istrar  legally  protected  a  stylised  menorah  used  by  a  Christian  group  that  proselytises  Jews,  a  Federal  Court  judge  has  reversed  the  decision.   Officials  of  the  Canadian  Jewish  Congress,  which  had  sought  a  judicial  review  of  the  matter  after  the  registrar  gave  the  Chosen  People  Ministries  exclu  sive  right  to  a  menorah  design  in  1999,  expressed  satisfaction  with  the  ruling.   The  congress  said  the  ministries’  claim  to  its  menorah  design  as  an  “official  mark”  was  “scan  dalous,  offensive  to  Canadians  and  deceptive”.   “In  our  view,  the  menorah  is  a  universal  Jewish  symbol,  and  it  is  one  that  should  not  be  claimed  by  any  organisation  in  particular,  and  certainly  not  an  organisation  created  for  the  express  purpose  of  converting  Jews  to  Christianity,”  said  Manuel  Prutschi,  national  director  of  community  relations  for  the  congress.   “Official  mark”  status  grants  extraordinary  pro  tections  even  broader  than  those  of  a  trademark.  It  usually  is  given  to  authorities  who  fulfill  a  public  duty  and  are  under  some  measure  of  government  control.  The  ruling  “ensures  that  no  single  organi  sation  can  claim  the  menorah  as  its  exclusive  prop  erty  and  that  the  menorah’s  use  most  certainly  cannot  be  denied  to  synagogues,  Jewish  organisa  tions  and  Jewish  persons,”  said  Jonathan  Kroft,  national  community  relations  vice-chair  at  the  con   gress.

"  Bridges  for  Peace...  Australian  national  dliector  Ron  Rossf  international  director  Clarence  Wagner  and  Australian  national  administrative  director  Jayne  Harding.   Doing  it  the  Christian  way   Danya  Levy   THEY  have  helped  12,000  people  get  to  Israel  from  the  former  Soviet  Union,  with  another  20,000  being  processed.   They  have  presented  gift  pack  ages  to  500,000  immigrants  to  Israel   since  1990.   They  run  offices  in  Australia,  Hong  Kong,  Singapore,  Britain,  Slo  vakia,  Ukraine,  United  States,  Cana  da,  Japan  and  Brazil.   And  they’re  Christian.   “1  don’t  think  there’s  an  immi   grant  in  Israel  who  doesn’t  know  about  Bridges  for  Peace,”  says  inter  national  director  Clarence  Wagner,  in  Australia  on  a  one-month  tour.   Bridges  for  Peace  was  the  brain  child  of  American  Christian  Zionist  Dr  G  Douglas  Young,  who  saw  a  need  for  a  grassroots  Christian  organisa  tion  to  support  Israel.   With  60  staff  in  Jerusalem,  the  organisation  aims  to  illustrate  to  Christians  the  relationship  between  their  religion  and  Judaism  by  exam  ining  the  roots  of  the  Church.   “The  Church  has  operated  in  Europe  to  disconnect  that  relation  ship,”  Mr  Wagner  said.  “Our  work  is   to  reconnect  it.”   Dispatch  from  Jerusalem  —  a  newspaper  which  publishes  infor  mation  on  agricultural  develop  ments  and  archaeological  finds,  among  other  topics  —  was   launched,  in  addition  to  which  Mr  Wagner  hosts  a  30-minute  weekly  news  magazine,  Jerusalem  Mosaic,  which  screens  three  times  a  week  in  Australia  on  Christian  television.   Bridges  for  Peace  has  also  devel  oped  a  radio  program,  Israel  News  Magazine,  which  is  aired  on  more  than  100  stations  in  Australia  and  will  extend  to  a  further  68  in  New  Zealand  over  the  next  few  weeks.   The  organisation  currently  runs  six  projects  —  four  in  Israel  and  two  in  the  former  Soviet  Union.   “We  cannot  change  the  past,   but  we  can  make  a  better   future.”   Under  its  Operation  Rescue,  it  works  with  the  Jewish  Agency  to  help  people  in  the  former  Soviet  Union  emigrate  to  Israel.  For  those  who  choose  not  to  leave,  it  conducts  Operation  Hope,  which  runs  food  programs  in  the  Ukraine  and  Siberia.   Immigrants  to  Israel  are  wel  comed  with  gifts  of  supplies,  food,  blankets,  school  kits  and  “a  card  from  the  Christian  who  donated  it.   Bridges  for  Peace  operates  Israel’s  first  and  largest  food  bank  under  a  project  known  as  Operation  Ezra.  Almost  two  tons  of  food  passes  through  its  distribution  centre  every   day,  feeding  15,000  people.   Operation  Ezra  works  with  70  social  welfare  agencies  to  distribute  food  to  people  in  need,  from  victims   of  terror  to  battered  women.   The  New  Testament  calls  for  the  rebuilding  of  Zion  and  for  Christians  to  be  the  “repairers  of  the  breach  and  restorers  of  the  streets  with  dwellings”,  Mr  Wagner  pointed  out.  “We  take  that  literally.”   Through  the  Home  Repair  Pro  ject,  rabbis  contact  Bridges  for  Peace  with  houses  needing  repairs.  The  ministry  has  renovated  two  orphanages  and  300  houses,  and  is  the  only  Christian  project  to  be  hon  oured  (twice)  by  the  Mayor  of   Jerusalem.   The  organisation  has  also  helped  to  form  a  lobby  group,  Australian   Christian  Voice  for  Israel  —  an  avenue  to  address  the  media  on  biased  Middle  East  reporting.   Mr  Wagner  gets  his  inspiration  from  his  Israel-born  daughters,  whom  he  accompanied  on  March  of  the  Living  last  year.  While  in  Poland,  his  16-year-old  told  him  “you  have  to  keep  doing  what  you  are  doing”.   “We  cannot  change  the  past,  but  we  can  make  a  better  future,”  he  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.  “We  can  create  alliances,  form  friendships  and  learn  from  each  other.”   Mr  Wagner  addressed  a  luncheon  of  communal  leaders,  hosted  by  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies.

"  Steadfast  support  from  Christian  Right   WITH  Israel  under  fire,  one  interest  group  is  remaining  steadfast  in  its  support  —  the  Christian  Right.  Its  affinity  isn’t  new,  but  it  has  taken  on  fresh  prominence  as  Jews  feel  isolated  in  the  face  of  global  support  for  the  intifada.   Jewish  groups  now  are  more  likely  to  acknowledge  the  evangelicals’  support,  showing  their  appreciation  and  hoping  that  other  religious  groups  might  follow  their  lead.   Just  how  much  things  have  changed  is  illustrated  by  the  Anti-Defamation  League’s  relationship  with  the  Christian  Right.  In  1994  the  ADL  published  a  report  called  The  Religious  Right:  The  Assault  on  Tolerance  and  Pluralism   in  America.   Now  the  ADL  is  running  an  advertisement  that  includes  a  piece  by  former  Christian  Coalition  executive  director  Ralph  Reed,  entitled  We  People  of  Faith  Stand  Firmly  With   Israel.

"  Christian-Jewish  dialogue  —  agreeing  to  disagree   CHRISTIAN-Jewish  dialogue  has  a  long  way  to  go,  Jewish  speakers  told  a  Jewish  Free  University  forum  at  North  Shore  Synagogue.   On  the  other  hand,  Christian  speakers  emphasised  that  great  progress  has  been  made,  with  mutual  respect  growing  between  the  two   faiths.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  for  mer  president  Peter  Wertheim  expressed  concern  that  actions  of  the  Church  in  the  20th  century  had  undermined  efforts  towards  dialogue.   Citing  the  beatification  of  Edith  Stein  and  the  establishment  of  a  church  and  planting  of  crosses  at  Auschwitz,  he  said  “Edith  Stein  went  to  her  death  as  a  Jew.  There  is  some  thing  perverse  in  seeing  her  death  as  Christian  martyrdom.”   He  noted  that  the  doctrine  of  Jewish  guilt  for  the  death  of  Jesus  still  pervades  some  churches,  and  some  Baptist  churches  still  target  Jews  for   conversion.   Claims  of  progress  in  the  dialogue  process  may  be  premature,  he  cau  tioned.  “Dialogue  still  has  a  long  way  to  go.”   Peta  Jones  Pellach,  Director  of  Adult  Education  for  The  Shalom  Institute,  condemned  the  Christian  churches  for  failing  to  respond  to  attacks  on  Israel,  insisting  that  most  attacks  target  Jews,  rather  than  any  political  issue.   The  Pope  had  failed  to  respond  to   Paul  O’Shea,  Aleck  Goldheig,  Peter  Wertheim,  Peta  Jones  Pellach,  Sister  Trish  Madigan,  Rabbi  David  Freedman.   Syrian  President  Bashir  Assad’s  bla  tant  antisemitism  and  continued  to  welcome  him  in  the  Vatican,  while  church  groups  have  been  silent  on  Yasser  Arafat’s  claim  that  the  Temple  never  stood  in  Jerusalem,  she  said.   “When  Judaism  is  attacked,  the  religion  of  Jesus  is  attacked.  When  Arafat  told  a  London  newspaper  that  the  Temple  had  never  been  in  Jerusalem,  where  was  the  Christian  outcry?   “Christianity  is  based  on  the  story  of  Jesus  as  a  Jew  in  Jerusalem.  The  beginning  of  the  Christian-Jewish  diar  logue  ought  to  be  our  common  her  itage:  Jesus  living  as  a  Jew.  If  that  is   taken  away  by  historical  revisionism,  given  tacit  approval  by  the  European  enemies  of  Israel,  the  foundation  for  discussion  is  shaken,  perhaps  removed.”   Sister  Trish  Madigan  and  Paul  O’Shea,  practising  Catholics  engaged  in  dialogue  with  the  Jewish  communi  ty,  both  suggested  that  great  progress  had  been  made  within  Christianity  to  understand  the  princi  ples  of  interfaith  dialogue.  Christianity  no  longer  saw  its  mission  as  proselytising  to  the  entire  world,  particularly  to  Jews,  they  said.   A  spirit  of  mutual  respect  had  emerged  within  which  there  is  room   for  discussion  about  matters  oi  iaiui.   They  reminded  the  audience  that  official  Church  policy  was  not  to  con  demn  Jews  for  the  death  of  Jesus,  which  opened  the  door  to  discussion  about  the  common  roots  of  Judaism  and  Christianity.   Sister  Madigan  —  a  participant  in  the  Women’s  Interfaith  Network  and  the  Australian  National  Dialogue  of  Christian,  Muslims  and  Jews  —  con  ceded  that  while  significant  theologi  cal  issues  would  always  remain  unresolved  between  the  two  faith  groups,  many  matters  of  mutual  inter  est  could  be  tackled  jointly,  including  the  pursuit  of  world  peace  and  con  cern  for  the  oppressed.   She  defined  “dialogue”  as  a  forum  for  the  genuine  sharing  of  ideas,  where  listening  is  more  important  than  speaking.   Mr  O’Shea  described  moments  of  true  dialogue  where  Jews  and  Christians  had  come  together  in  an  atmosphere  of  respect,  each  group  confident  in  its  own  faith  and  accept  ing  of  the  other.   Expressing  optimism  in  the  dia  logue  process,  he  emphasised  that  the  Christian  Church  is  not  monolith  ic,  but  is  divided  about  the  role  of  dia  logue.   Catholic  Church  policy  is  to  pro  mote  reconciliation  between  Christians  and  Jews,  and  Catholics  abhor  the  activities  of  some  Christians  who  regard  dialogue  as  an   uppui  lunity  L[Jciouauc  JCW5  Uie   error  of  their  ways”.   Similarly,  some  Jews  see  dialogue  as  simply  a  venue  to  air  grievances,  rather  than  an  opportunity  to  seek  common  ground.  This,  too,  is  unhelp  ful  in  forging  mutual  respect.   On  the  other  hand,  an  atmosphere  of  dialogue  should  permit  honesty  —  including  the  expression  of  concerns.   ""The  doctrine  of  Jewish  guilt  for  the  death  of  Jesus  still  pervades  some  churches,   and  some  Baptist  churches   still  target  Jews  for   conversion.""   The  audience  included  a  number  of  Christians  who  defended  their  churches  and  described  their  experi  ence  of  dialogue.   A  former  executive  director  of  the  South  African  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  Aleck  Goldberg,  spoke  of   reconciliation  efforts  between  Jews  and  Christians  in  the  old  and  new  South  Africa.   Saying  race  was  a  more  important  issue  than  religion  in  South  Africa,  he  described  the  process  as  “climbing  Jacob’s  ladder—one  rung  at  a  time”.   Kehillat  Masada  Rabbi  David  Freedman  chaired  the  discussion. ",2002-11-29
"  1000  Christian  Zionists  at  Celebration  Shalom   David  Bearman   ABOUT  1000  Christian  Zionists  repre  senting  30  pro-Israel  Christian  organi  sations  held  their  annual  gathering  on  the  Gold  Coast  recently.   The  weekend  included  a  kosher  Friday  night  Shabbat  meal  attended  by  200  people,  including  representa  tives  of  the  local  Jewish  community.   The  festival  marked  Celebration  Shalom’s  22nd  anniversary.   Keynote  speaker  Phil  Hunter  is  the  British-based  international  director  of  Exodus  Project.  Its  “Good  News”  bus  service  has  assisted  70,000  Jews  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  to  make  their  way  to  Israel.   In  fact,  one  in  five  immigrants  to  Israel  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  have  been  funded  and  transported  by  Christian  organisations.   Also  addressing  the  gathering  was  Reverend  Willem  Glashouwer,  the  Dutch-based  president  of  Christians  for  Israel  International—an  organisa  tion  which  rallies  Christians  to  sup  port  Israel  politically  and  financially.   Queensland-based  Jesma  O’Hara  and  board  members  of  the  Australian  chapter  of  the  International  Christian  Embassy  of  Jerusalem  gave  presenta   tions.  She  and  her  husband  recently  returned  from  a  visit  to  Poland  which  included  the  Nazi  death  camps  at  Majdanek,  Treblinka  and  Auschwitz.   Rabbi  Dr  Avrum  Ehrlich,  former  CEO  of  the  University  of  Sydney’s  Mandelbaum  House,  gave  presenta   tions  on  Jewish-Christian  relations.   Holocaust  survivor  Joseph  Hofmanis,  who  has  lived  in  Sydney  since  the  1940s,  gave  the  first-ever  public  account  of  his  harrowing  story  of  survival  when,  from  the  ages  of  13  to  17,  he  survived  ghettos  in  Latvia,  the  Stutthoff  concentration  camp  and  death  marches  in  Germany.   Mr  Hofmanis’  speech  was  greeted  with  a  standing  ovation  and  tears.   The  festival  included  music,  dance  and  theatre  with  an  overwhelmingly  Israel-orientated  theme.  Many  of  the  pro-Israel  Christian  organisations  had  stalls  during  the  festival.   The  Israel  Tourism  Office  also  ran   a  stall  to  promote  tourism  to  Israel   and  to  screen  Israel  tourism  films.   Many  of  the  groups  represented  at  Celebration  Shalom  are  organising  solidarity  tours  to  Israel.   19  Dr  David  Beirman  is  director  of  the  Israel  Tourism  office  in  Sydney.

"  Horny  Christian  reclaims  virginity  for  14th  time   CHERRYBROOK,  Sunday;  A  member  of  the  West  Pennant  Hills  Christian  Youth  Fellowship,  Karen  Long,  has  committed  herself  to  abstaining  from  the  pleasures  of  the  flesh  after  a  torrid  sexual  encounter  with  a  fellow  Churchgoer.  Ms  Long  has  engaged  in  sexual  intercourse  with  13   others  in  the  last  18  months,  reclaiming  her  status  as  a  person  who  has  never  had  sexual  relations  after  each  incident.  ""I've  decided  to  save  myself  until  the  day  I  enter  a  biblical  marriage  relationship"",  Ms  Long  told  a  skeptical  Fellowship  group  on  last  Sunday.  ""I  just  thank  God  that  he  has  such  unlimited  capacity  for  forgiveness.  I'  really  need  it.""  ""We  look  on  virginity  less  as  a  physical  state  but  more  as  a  state  of  mind,""  explained  the  Fellowship's  spiritual  leader  Father  Bob  Dooley,  ""which  is  lucky  for  Karen.  As  long  as  she's  sincere  in  her  commitment  to  sexual  abstinence,  it  doesn't  really  matter  how  many  times  she  has  sex.""  ""I've  seen  the  error  of  my  ways  again"",  Ms  Long  declared  during  a   prayer  session  at  her  local  Church  earlier  this  week,  after  providing  a  graphic  account  of  her  sins.  ""I  have  strayed  from  the  path  of  righteousness  and,  what's  worse,  I've  led  another  member  of  this  Fellowship  into  the  moral  abyss  of  sexual  ecstasy"".  Despite  her  most  recent  transgression,  the  primarily  male  Youth  Fellowship  voted  overwhelmingly  against  expelling  Ms  Long  from  the  prayer  group.  Ms  Long  says  she  is  happy  that  the  Fellowship  did  not  reject  her.  ""The  Church  is  supposed  to  be  for  sinners,  not  saints,  so  I  should  certainly  be  there.""  Long  is  also  happy  to  recover  her  status  as  a  virgin,  saying,  ""In  my  experience,  it's  quite  a  turn  on  for  the  guys"". ",2002-08-09

"  What  I  envy  about  the  Christian  religion   VIEWPOINT   •  Rabbi  John  Levi   HOLY  envy  is  a  challenge.  And   to  be  brutally  honest,  there  are  some  characteristics  in  my  neighbour’s  faith  and  religious  path  that  stir  envy  in  my  soul.   I  have  never  recovered  from  the  shock  I  received  at  a  conference  of  the  Uniting  Church.  Delegates  had  come  from  all  over  Australia  and  the  South  Pacific,  and  all  speeches  were  limited  to  three  minutes.   When  a  bell  rang,  the  speaker  obe  diently  sat  down.  Jewish  meetings   are  not  like  that  —  ever.   We  love  to  argue.  We  talk  and  talk.  I  am  envious  of  such  obedient  silence.   When  I  began  to  teach  Catholic  theological  students  in  Melbourne  many  years  ago,  I  discovered  that  a  very  important  part  of  the  training  of  a  priest  is  contemplation  and  silence.   A  Jewish  rabbinical  training   course  depends  upon  argument  and  discussion.  Just  trying  to  understand  the  question  is  often  enough.   There  is  only  one  place  in  the  world  where  Jews  constitute  a  major  ity:  the  beleaguered  State  of  Israel.   I  am  envious  of  the  Christian  world  because  it  is  a  world.  It  has  the  luxury  of  size.  Nobody  is  going  to  destroy  Christendom,  although  there  is  danger.  Nobody  has  connected  the  dots,  as  the  Jews  would  have  done.   Being  part  of  a  minority  can  deep  en  a  sense  of  identity,  but  it  also  can  be  a  profoundly  discouraging  experi   ence.   A  story  from  Rabbi  Lionel  Blue   illustrates  my  envy:   A  Jewish  boy  telephones  his  mother  to  tell  her  that  he  is  in  love.   “Her  name  is  Mary  Magdalene  O’Murphy,”  he  whispers.   “How  can  you  mention  such  a  name  to  your  Yiddishe  Mama?”  she   sobs  before  hanging  up.   Some  months  later,  he  calls  her  from  America.   “I’m  in  love  again,”  he  sighs.   “What’s  her  name?”  asks  his  mother  suspiciously.   “Miss  Goldberg,”  he  replies.   “Goldberg,  a  fine  Jewish  name!”  cries  his  mother.  “God  has  answered  my  prayers!”   “That’s  nice,  Mum,”  he  says.  “Her  first  name  is  Whoopi.”   A  Jewish  wedding  for  us  is  not  just  a  wedding.  It  is  a  covenantal  affirma  tion  about  the  Jewish  future.  I  am  envious  of  families  in  which  a  wed  ding  is  simply  a  wedding.   I  would  love  to  live  outside  a  big  city.  In  the  country,  by  the  beach.  But  if  we  moved,  we  would  lose  our  reli  gious  community  and  our  congrega  tion  and  our  school  and  the  delicatessen  that  sells  us  bread  for  Shabbat  and  bagels  for  Sunday.   And,  far  more  serious,  we  would  have  robbed  our  children  of  their  sense  of  community.  We  would  have  lost  our  next  generation,  and  that  means  losing  our  immortality.   At  a  wedding  last  Sunday,  the  mother  of  a  10-year-old  told  me  how  her  daughter  came  home  from  school  and  asked  whether  they  could  become  secret  Jews.   “What  do  you  mean?”  her  mother   “Well,  we  should  take  the  mezuzah  off  the  doorpost  and  hide  our  Sabbath  candlesticks.  Nobody   needs  to  know  we  are  Jewish.”   This  10-year-old  Australian  Jewish  girl  didn’t  want  to  be  bombed.   Paranoia?  Well,  yes,  but...   She  had  noticed  that  there  are   guards  at  the  gates  of  her  school  and  a  high  security  fence.  I  am  envious  of  children  who  go  to  schools  that  don’t  have  to  employ  security  guards.   I  am  jealous  of  the  Anglican  Church  near  my  home.  It  rebuilt  its  facade  when  we  rebuilt  our  syna  gogue  two  kilometres  away.  We  had  already  survived  two  Molotov  cock  tail  attacks,  so  we  put  in  bomb-proof  windows  and  a  metal  fence.   The  church  stands  open  to  the  world,  its  glass  face  opening  onto  its  social  hall,  unscathed  for  10  years.  I  am  envious  of  that  glass  facade.   But  the  church  recently  installed  a  security  system.  Does  that  make  me  feel  better?  Absolutely  not.   I  have  attempted  to  list  those  facets  of  Christian  religious  life  of  which  I  am  envious,  with  the  proviso  that  I  know  envy  cannot  be  holy.  It  is   a  list  of  things  that  I  wish  my  tradition  could  claim  without  denying  its  own  authenticity:   The  Beatitudes;  The  Magnificat;  Johann  Sebastian  Bach  and  all  the  other  Bachs;  Mozart’s  Requiem;  The  American  Spirituals  (remember  that  film  Keeping  the  Faith,  when  a  black  choir  burst  into  singing  the  Sabbath  hymn  Ein  Kelohenu  as  a  spiritual);   “I  am  envious  of  children  who   go  to  schools  that  don’t  have  to  employ  security  guards.""   The  Cathedral  at  Chartres;  Handel’s  Zadok  the  Priest,  the  pipe  organ  at  Notre  Dame;  St  Francis  of  Assisi;  King’s  College  Chapel  and  Choir;  Pope  John  XXIII;  the  Salvation  Army;  the  Society  of  St  Vincent  de  Paul;  the  Brotherhood  of  St  Laurence;  the  Christian  belief  in  Heaven;  the  Jesuit  Theilard  de  Chardin.  (I  will  not  men   tion  seafood  cocktails.)   There  is  a  richness  about  Christian  liturgy  that  is  dazzling.  True,  much  of  it  is  based  on  the  litur  gy  of  the  Temple  in  Jerusalem,  but  times  were  tough  and  we  lost  it.  We  write  fantastic  prayer-books,  but  we  are  not  very  good  at  praying.  Sadly,  many  Jews  are  seventh-day  absen   tists!   Danish  philosopher  Soren  Kierkegaard  was  strolling  down  a  street  in  Copenhagen  when  he  saw  a  sign  in  a  shop  window  that  read  “Hats  for  Sale”.  He  entered  and  asked  the  man  behind  the  counter  whether  he  could  see  his  range  of  hats.   The  shopkeeper  replied:  “But  sir,  we  don’t  sell  hats.”   “But  in  your  window  there  is  a  sign  that  clearly  says  ‘Hats  for  Sale’.”   The  shopkeeper  smiled:  “Ah,  yes.  We  don’t  sell  hats;  we  sell  signs.”   Of  course,  I  have  been  talking  about  signs.  Signposts  don’t  seem  to  be  important  until  we  think  of  a  world  without  them  —  no  “Stop”,  no  “Turn  Left”,  no  “Go  Back,  Wrong  Way”.   Without  signs,  we  have  no  sense  of  distance  and  no  sense  of  place.  We  have  to  begin  by  understanding  that  we  are  talking  about  labels.   The  content  and  context  of  reli  gious  behaviour  is  not  the  same  as  the  doctrines  and  dogma  that  we  use  as  signposts  to  religious  behaviour  which  is  the  human,  finite  response  to  the  God  of  Creation,  who  called  forth  the  universes  out  of  nothing,  whose  law  and  power  and  thunder  reverberate  from  Sinai.   ■  Rabbi  John  Levi  is  one  of  the  founders  of  the  Council  for  Christians  and  Jews.  This  is  an  edited  extract  of  a   speech  to  the  Council. ",2002-06-14
"  Ahuvah  Gray   How  an  earthquake  in  LA  converted  a  black  Christian   IT  took  an  earthquake  measuring  a  startling  6.7  on  the  Richter  Scale  to  “shake  me  out  of  my  comfort  zone”,  says  Ahuvah  Gray,  by  way  of  introduction  to  her  remarkable  story.   As  a  sales  representative  for  Continental  Air  lines  with  an  apartment  in  Los  Angeles,  Ms  Gray  —  known  then  as  Delores  and  an  ordained  African-American  Christian  minister  —  had  what  she  describes  as  “a  comfortable  lifestyle”.   But  the  earthquake  on  January  17,  1994  changed  her  life.  It  was,  she  says,  the  first  day  of   the  rest  of  her  life.   At  48,  after  examining  the  destruction  which  the  tremor  caused  to  her  apartment,  she  decid   ed  to  move  to  Israel.   Three  years  later,  her  51st  birthday,  Ms  Gray  converted  to  Judaism.  But  her  journey  towards  Judaism  had  begun  long  before.   Bom  and  raised  in  a  Baptist  household  as  the  grand-daughter  of  Mississippi  sharecrop  pers,  Ms  Gray  came  from  what  she  terms  “a  praying  background”.   Even  as  a  child  studying  the  Bible,  she  would  close  her  eyes  and  pretend  that  Abraham  was  her  great-grandfather.  She  felt  she  had  a  Jewish   soul.   “From  a  very  early  age,  I  felt  an  affinity  to  the  Jewish  people.  You  can  take  a  Jewish  neshama  (soul),  put  it  in  any  vessel  and  it  will  do  whatever  it  takes  to  find  its  way  to   Yiddishkeit.”   Ms  Gray  was  speaking  to  the  Australian  Jew  ish  News  before  embarking  on  a  three-week  lec  ture  tour  of  Australia  to  promote  her  autobiography  My  Sister,  the  Jew.   Her  first  encounter  with  Jews  occurred  when  she  found  a  job  in  a  dress  shop  owned  by  a  Jewish  family.  “The  warmth  and  closeness  I  felt  in  their  home  was  the  exact  same  thing  I  felt  in  my  own  home.”   Graduating  from  university,  she  spent  zb  years  as  a  flight  attendant  and  supervisor  at  Continental  Airlines  before  moving  into  sales   and  marketing.   It  was  then  that  she  became  a  born-again  Christian  and  spent  14  years  as  a  minister.  But   still  her  heart  was  in  Israel.   Opening  a  travel  agency,  she  led  an  organ   ised  tour  to  Israel.  It  was  to  be  the  first  of  14  vis  its  over  the  next  five  years.  “The  first  time  I  vis  ited,  I  knew  I  wanted  to  live  there.  I  felt  I  had   come  home.”   In  1993,  she  was  invited  to  learn  Hebrew  at  Ulpan  Akiva  in  Netanya,  during  which  time  she  stayed  in  Jerusalem  for  Rosh  Hashanah  and  Yom  Kippur.   “It  was  [during]  that  experience  when  I  knew  I  was  converting.  Hearing  Kol  Nidre  for  the  first  time  —  that  did  it.  That  was  one  of  the  most  awesome  experiences  I  had  in  my  life.   “It  was  like  my  neshama  knew  that  niggun  (melody).  It  was  really  like  a  soul  resonance;  there’s  no  question  about  it.”   The  following  year,  she  settled  in  Bayit  Vegan,  a  predominantly  ultraOrthodox  neigh  bourhood  of  Jerusalem.  “I  moved  from  one  black  neighbourhood  to  another  black  neigh  bourhood,”  she  jests.  “It’s  a  lot  different  to  Bev  erly  Hills.”   “Being  raised  an  African-American   black  has  one  set  of  problems.  Being   a  Jew  has  a  new  meaning  of   suffering.  It’s  a  very  painful  thing.”   Her  Jerusalem  neighbourhood  is  far  from  her  grandparents’  and  parents’  roots  in  Mound  Bayou,  Mississippi,  “but  close^  in  spirit  to  the   sentiments  of  my  loving  family”.   “living  in  Eretz  Yisrael,  I’ve  learned  a  deeper  meaning  to  suffering.  Being  bom  and  raised  an  African-American  black  in  America  has  one  set  of  difficulties  and  problems.  Being  a  Jew  has  a  whole  new  depth  and  meaning  of  suffering  because  you’re  hated  for  your  very  existence.   “It’s  a  very  deep,  painful  thing.”   But  she  wouldn’t  change  her  life  for  any  thing.  “The  things  I  gave  up  materially,  I  certain  ly  gained  on  a  spiritual  level.  That  far  exceeds  anything  I  left  behind.”   ffl  Ms  Gray  will  speak  at  the  Jewish  Learning  Cen  tre  in  North  Bondi  on  Monday,  July  22  at  7.30pm.  Tickets  $15  at  the  door.

"  From  red  wine  to  export  abalone   conversation  with  Andrew  Christian   ""Mi  ""y  South  dad  East  had  which  a  farm  ran  in  to  the  the  .sea,  so  I've  been  around  water  all  my  life.  About  as  soon  as  I  could  drag  a  weight  belt  I've  been  diving  and  exploring  the  sea.  I  have  my  ticket  and  dive  about  two  days  a  week  for  commercial  contracts,  mostly  for  maintenance  on  abalone  farm  sea  pipes  but  I  am  also  experimenting  with  my  own  sea-based  abalone  cages.  I  am  28  years  old  and  have  worked  in  three  completely  different  fields  that  have  led  me  to  Port  Lincoln,  to  a  job  and  lifestyle  I  enjoy.  I  work  at  Southern  Australian  Seafoods  as  the  construction  maintenance  manager  setting  up  a  100  tonne  ab  farm.  We  are  almost  there,  with  about  four  hectares  developed.  I  left  school  when  I  was  15  and  did  an  apprenticeship  in  machining,  before  going  to  the  Riverland  and  working  on  Banrock  Station.  That  was  before  it  was  a  winery,  when  it  was  a  spud  and  onion  farm.  I  worked  on  the  machinery  and  tractors,  finishing  my  apprenticeship  and  pursuing  my  fiance.  We  had  started  the  wetlands  work  with  the  help  of  a  US  group  called  Ducks  Unlimited.  About  one  third  of  the  station  was  wetlands,  so  our  work  involved  lining  banks  and  creating  fish  gates.   BRL  Hardy  bought  the  station  and  I  started  in  the  viticulture  trade.  We  put  in  600  acres  of  vines  and  expanded  the  wetlands  project.  I  was  promoted  to  assistant  manager  of  Lake  Cullulleraine,  near  the  Victorian  border  after  BLR  Hardy  bought  that  and  I  put  in  415  acres  of  vineyards  there.  That  was  my  first  management  job.  I  moved  back  to  Kingston  on  the  Murray  for  my  first  private  job  and  set  up  another  vineyard  at  New  Residence.  I  put  in  320  acres  of  vineyard,  there  already  was  100  existing  acres  and  there  was  40  acres  of  citrus  that  I  managed  as  well.  What  I  enjoy  is  project  management  -  putting  something  together.  After  three  years  I  had  the  opportunity  to  come  here  and  help  set  up  an  abalone  farm.  This  was  another  project  where  I  had  responsibility  to  ensure  large  amounts  of  investor  funds  were  wisely  spent.  It  was  literally  a  green  field  development  -  there  was  just  grass  when  I  started  here.  It  was  very  similar  to  establishing  a  vineyard  because  it  involved  pumping  water  and  setting  up  systems  for  the  most  efficient  way  to  handle  the  water  and  grow  the  abalone.  I  enjoy  the  development  side  of  aquaculture,  looking  at  new  techniques.   I  was  able  to  bring  in  technology  that  no  one  had  used  here  in  ab  farms,  because  I  was  familiar  with  it  in  viticulture.  It's  about  thinking  outside  the  circle.  We  have  our  own  generators  and  we  pump  water  24  hours  a  day.  Our  pumps  have  been  running  non-stop  for  about  three  years.  We  pump  around  600  litres  of  water  a  second,  through  tanks  holding  3.5  million  abs.  I  have  done  a  project  management  course  through  TAFE  which  virtually  rubber  stamped  what  I  had  already  done.   When  I'm  not  working  I  spend  time  with  my  family,  wife  Karen  and  sons  Douglass,  6,  Benjamin,  5,  and  Kyron,  2.  My  favourite  pastime  is  diving.   SEA  FARMING  VISION:  Andrew  Christian  enjoys  the  challenge  of  establishing  and  designing  new  projects.  He  is  pictured  with  some  farmed  abalone.  He  hopes  to  establish  sea-based  farms  in  the  future. ",2002-12-03
"  [?]   Supporting  the  President:  The  NRA  and  Christian  Coalitions  Anti-Terrorism  Plan.   By  Charlton  Heston  (NRA  Moses)  and  Rev.  Jerry  Falwell  (Guy  that  called  the  purple  telletubby  gay)   We  support  the  President.  But  we  sup  port  the  president  critically;  let  it  be  known  that  we  will  not  be  silent  when  we  believe  the  President  should  be  doing  more  to  defeat  the  evil  ones.  It  is  important  in  a  free  nation  that  dis  sent  exists  .  Fi?--sf-lv;  rhp  P,hrisrian  Cnnlirinn  believes   that  moral  decay  at  home  and  terror  ism  abroad  are  a  part  of  the  same  problem.  We  are  in  a  religious  war  and  God  said  to  us  at  sll  that  we  were  not  being  as  Christian  and  moral  as  we  could  be.  Thus,  it  is  time  we  con  fronted  the  problems  at  home.  The  President  needs  to  stop  abortion,  de  velop  anti-gay  laws,  and  should  im  prison  mothers  who  have  illegitimate  children.  Only  be  defeating  immoral  -  .  ity  will  we  triumph  against  die  devil's  minions  and  preserve  our  freedom.  The  second  limb  of  our  antiterror  ism  plan  is  from  the  NRA..  We  plan  to  install  metal  detectors  in  every  school  and  office  building  in  this  country.  This  allows  us  to  identify  those  stu  dents  and  workers  who  are  not  armed  and  ready  for  anti-terrorist  action.  Also  we  believe  Bush's  plan  for  armed  marshall's  on  airline  flights  will  'not  work.  Rather,  as  passengers  board  the  plane  they  should  be  handed  head  phones  in  one  hand  and'  a  firearm  in  the  other.  Only  when  we  arc  armed  will  we  be  safe.   Too  often  we  see  Islamic  people  practicing  their  faith  in  public  with  out  scrutiny.  These  people  could  be  spreading  die  word  of  terror.  The  US  government  should  institute  a  'license  to  kick  policy',  where  if  any  good  de  cent  god  fearing  American  sees  any  person  who  is  practicing  their  faith  suspiciously  they  have  a  license  to  lack  these  people,  a  lot.  We  would  like  to  praise  the  president.  Firstly,  the  president  is  in  favour  of  prayer  in  public  schools.  He  recog  nizes  that  only  through  institutional  ized  prayer  can  we  defeat  the  secular  and  Islamic  nations  and  defend  our  freedom.  The  president's  new  civil  lib  erties  laws  are  superb.  Under  the  presidents  laws  the  FBI  can  imprison  anyone  who  looks  suspicious  (not  on  the  basis  of  their  race  :  —  which  is  wrong),  but  on  the  basis  of  their  skin  color  and  facial  characteristics.  The  president  has  ensured  that  the  great  American  justice  principle  of  'innocent  until  proven  guilty'  will  not  operate  to  protect  guilty  terrorists.  In  conclu  sion  all  we  would  like  to  say  is  God  Bless  America.   A  terrorist  in  disguise ",2002-02-01

"  Hard  to  unscramble   fllovie  Review  The  Bi9  Iri/h  Oil   Windtalkers.  Starring  Nicolas  Cage,  Adam  Beach,  Christian  Slater,  Peter  Stormare,  Noah  Emmerich  and  Mark  Ruffalo.  Rated  MA   In  war,  battlefield  communication  is  vital  to  military  success.  In  ancient  times  communications  relied  on  the  speed  of  a  man  and  a  good  steed.   Various  improvements  were  developed  down  the  centuries  until,  eventually,  radio  was  invented.  Radio  broadcast  communications,  while  offering  ease  of  comms  over  varying  distances  and  with  varying  degrees  of  reliability,  were,  and  still  are,  problematic  in  that,  by  their  very  nature,  anyone  tuned  to  the  right  fre  quency  can  hear  every  word.  The  next  evolution  was  encryption.  Add  a  clever  code  to  scramble  the  message  and  Bob's  your  uncle.  Except  it  doesn't  take  a  clever  enemy  too  long  to  crack  even  the  cleverest  code,  by  fair  means  or  foul.  Hence,  more  and  more  elaborate  and  intricate  codes  have  been  developed  —  and  cracked  —  in  the  course  of  war  and  peace.  During  WW2,  the  Yanks  came  up  with  a  clever  counter  countermeasure.  Using  an  ancient,  homegrown  resource  they  made  up  a  fairly  crude  and  simple  code  and  then  translated  it  into  the  native  tongue  of  the  Navajo  nation.  Thus,  no  matter  how  clever  they  were,  the  Japs  would  have  to  be  real  lucky  to  break  that  code.  Therefore,  to  break  this  highly  prized  code,  the  enemy  would  have  to  catch  themselves  a  live  windtalker  as  the  Navajo  soldiers  were  known.  Hence,  the  windtalkers  were  a  highly  protected  species.  But,  from  the  Yankee  view-point,  there  was  no  use  keeping  them  at  home  where  they  couldn't  be  shot  —  windtalkers  needed  to  be  where  the  code  was  needed  —  that  is,  at  the  sharp  end.  So,  to  protect  the  code,  the   windtalkers  needed  protection  —  their  own  personal  bodyguards.  That's  where  Sergeant  Joe  Enders  (Cage)  comes  in.  The  tormented,  bat  tle-hardened  US  Marine  with  some  thing  to  prove  and  a  chip  evenly  bal  anced  on  both  shoulders,  assigned  to  protect  the  code  stored  deep  in  the  young  head  of  Private  Ben  Yahzee  (Beach).  Deployed  with  the  main  assault  on  Saipan  Island  at  the  latter  end  of  WW2,  the  Marines  and  their  code  talkers  faced  a  huge,  well-dug-in  enemy  determined  to  defend  the  outer  vestiges  of  their  own  motherland.  Windtalkers  is  a  blockbuster  movie  from  acclaimed  director  John  Woo,  the  man  who  brought  us  Face  Off  and  Mission  Impossible  II  but,  I  think  it's  fair  to  say,  falls  a  long  way  short  of  living  up  to  its  predecessors  in  this  post  -Saving  Private  /?v««-war-movie  era.  On  the  one  hand,  it  seemed  as  though  Windtalkers  was  trying  hard  to  fit  in  the  ultra-realistic  war-movie  genre  but  let  itself  down  badly  in  key  areas  of  realism.  On  the  other,  realism  was  so  sus  pended  that  it  seemed  the  film  was  try  ing  to  be  a  typical  Hollywood  action  movie.  Throughout  the  movie,  it  was  hard  to  tell  the  source  of  one  explo  sion  from  another.  Hand  grenades  were  delivering  as  much  blast  and  effect  as  225kg  bombs  dropped  from  on  high.  Then  there  was  the  bottomless  Hollywood  magazine,  where  a  single  good  guy  could  mow  down  a  whole   section  of  Nips  with  a  ceaseless  spray  of  magically  lethal  9mm-pistol  rounds.  The  actual  windtalker  code  itself  was  poorly  utilised  as  well.  We  all  know  why  code  is  so  valuable  in  a  military  campaign.  I  think  it's  proba  bly  fair  to  assume  that  we  also  know  that  to  use  code  willy  nilly  in  the  heat  of  battle  is  a  bit  pointless.  When  call  ing  in  indirect  fire,  for  example,  on  to  a  target,  encoding  the  enemy's  coordi  nates  is  probably  a  bit  superfluous.   In  summary,  Windtalkers  tries  to  be  a  true-to-life  war  film  in  the  vein  of  Saving  Private  Ryan  or  Black  Hawk  Down  while  at  the  same  time  trying  too  hard  to  suspend  realism  in  favour  of  the  action-hero  genre,  and  quite  frankly,  fails  in  both  departments.

"  Women’s   Title:  Taking  Up  the  Timbrel:  The   Challenge  of  Creating  Ritual  for  Jewish  Women  Today   Editors:  Sylvia  Rothschild  and   Sybil  Sheridan   Publisher:  Student  christian  Movement   Press,  212  pp,  $  42.95   Reviewer:  Gael  Hammer   THIS  is  a  volume  of  modern  English   techinnes  —  prayers  composed  by   women.   Based  on  a  long  and  venerable  tradition,  techinnes  were  prayers  in  the  vernacular,  usually  Yiddish,  created,  but  infrequently  written  down,  by  women  with  needs  not  addressed  by  the  composers  of  Jewish  prayer-books.   Women  have  long  created  rituals.  The  lighting  of  candles  to  welcome  the  Shabbat  and  Holy  Days  is  not  mandated  by  the  Torah,  but  by  the  rabbis.   To  this  practice  women  added  white  tablecloths,  twisted  challot,  traditional  foods  and  in  some  societies,  Shabbat  table  songs.  There  is  always  opportunity  for  hadar  mitzvot  (beautifying  command  ments).   With  the  title,  Taking  Up  the  Timbrel,  drawn  from  the  passage  in  Exodus  when  Miriam  and  the  women  sang  and  danced  to  celebrate  the  Israelites’  safe  departure  from  Egypt,  this  book  is  edited  by  two  Reform  rabbis  from  suburban  London.   The  15  contributors  are  all  women,  and  all  but  one  have  been  ordained  as  rabbis.   The  needs  they  address  form  an  extraor  dinary  assembly.  “How  to  Pray  When  You  Cannot  Pray”  must  resonate  with  many.  Rituals  for  pregnancy,  infertility,  loss  of  a  baby  and  abortion  are  offered.   How  many  people  might  benefit  from  a  ritual  when  a  relationship  breaks  down?   There  are  prayers  for  depression,  specific  female  conditions  like  mastectomy,  and   even  a  kaddish  to  be  recited  on  the  death  of  a  beloved  pet.   The  Talmud  was  originally  written  by  men  for  men  to  read,  and  so  contains  gap  ing  omissions  in  response  to  women’s  spir  itual  needs.  One  of  its  singular  omissions  is  that  it  does  not  tell  a  woman  how  to  respond  after  safely  giving  birth.   The  blessing  offered  is  the  same  as  that  to  be  recited  when  one  eats  a  new  season  al  fruit  or  wears  new  clothes.  This  inade  quacy  typifies  the  lack  of  rabbinic  aware  ness  of  the  spiritual  space  a  woman  occu  pies  when  she  is  first  given  her  new  baby.   Taking  Up  the  Timbrel  seeks  to  fill  such  gaps,  and  many  women  seeking  spiritual  connection  for  special  situations  will  find  these  prayers  empowering.   ■  Gael  Hammer  is  a  relationship  counsellor  and  Melton  Program  facilitator.

"  North  Eastern  Province:  your  candidates   Christianity  first   Christian  Democratic  Party  (Fred  Nile  Group)  candidate  for  North  Eastern  Province,  Phil  Seymour.  Every  Victorian  has  the  opportunity  to  shape  our  state's  future..  Christianity  comes  first  in  my  life,  even  in  politics.  The  Radical  and  Religious  Vilification  Bill  should  be  removed  ,  as  this  will  create  strife  amongst  different  faiths.  Injecting  rooms  and  street  prostitution  need  to  be  kept  out  of  Victoria.  Our  children  must  be  protected  with  an  active  role  promoting  moral  values  and  ethics.  Remember  God  greated  Adam  and  Eve  (not  Adam  and  Steve)  to  rule  over  the  environment.  If  we  look  after  the  environment,  the  environment  will  look  after  us.  If  we  lock  it  up  and  forget  it,  it  will  self-destruct.  Victoria  needs  the  Christian   Democratic  Party,  who  will  not  sell  out  on  Christian  values/ethics  and  not  just  be  a  rubber  stamp,  but  an  active,  accountable  party.  Think  of  what  the  current  government  has  done.  Please  give  us  a  go,  we  can  only  do  better.   •  Phil  Seymour ",2002-11-27

"  School  site  out   By  Stan  Gorton   DEVELOPMENT  approval  for  a  proposed  Port  Lincoln  Christian  school  has  been  overturned  by  the  environment  and  development  court  in  Adelaide.  The  court  determined  it  was  an  inappropriate  use  and  that  there  had  been  a  lack  of  planning  by  the  council  and  the  school  proponents  in  the  siting  of  the  school  off  Robertson  Road.   School  supporters  and  a  councillor  have  hit  back  saying  the  problem  of  school  crowding  is  ongoing  and  new  locations  on  the  edge  of  the  city  need  to  be  found.  The  Environment,  Resources  and  Development  Court  overturned  the  Port  Lincoln  City  Council's  approval  for  the  proposed  Flinders  Association  for  Christian  Education  school  that  would  have  been  located  on  5.1  hectares  off  Robertson  Road.   Two  Kurura  Street  residents  appealed  the  council's  decision  to  the  court  claiming  a  school  was  not  a  suitable  use  for  the  rural  area  with  extra  traffic,  noise  and  other  concerns.  Danny  Bartlett  represented  the  Kurara  Street  residents  and  said  the  dozen  or  so  people  that  signed  a  petition  did  not  think  a  school  was  an  appropriate  use  for  the  location.  ""I  believe  a  school  has  characteristics  similar  to  commer-   cial  development  with  noise  and  traffic,""  Mr  Bartlett  said.  ""Then  there  was  the  clearance  of  native  vegetation.""  DK  Quarries  is  located  about  300  to  600  metres  away  from  the  proposed  location  and  it  had  some  concerns  about  the  proximity  of  its  activities  to  the  school  but  later  reached  an  agreement  with  the  proponents  that  included  locating  the  school  as  far  away  as  possible  from  the  quarry.  Continued  Page  3   Back  to  drawing  board  for  school  site   From  Page  1  Concerns  about  inappropriate  usage  of  rural  land,  the  lack  of  information  provided  to  the  court  and  clearance  of  native  vegetation  were  among  the  reasons  given  by  the  State's  top  planning  court  for  its  decision  to  overturn  the  approval.  ""The  development  of  a  school  on  the  subject  land,  given  that  the  land  is  likely  to  be  some  distance  from  the  homes  of  many  of  those  who  would  attend  it,  would  appear  to  us  to  fly  in  the  face  of  the  development  plan  for  the  area  of  the  city  of  Port  Lincoln,""  the  court  stated  in  its  findings.   Councillor  Margaret  Tilsner  said  finding  additional  space  for  schools  was  a  challenge  for  the  community,  especially  with  discussions  of  freeing  up  more  space  in  the  central  business  district  by  relocating  existing  schools.  ""We  are  going  to  have  to  find  Space,  not  only  for  the  Christian  school,""  Mrs  Tilsner  said.  Her  view  was  that  schools  could  fit  into  the  fringe  areas  as  they  usually  had  large  areas  of  open  space  for  recreation  and  that  transport  would  have  to  be  looked  at  as  a  way  of  bringing  students  to  more  remote  schools.  The  Flinders  Association  for  Christian  Education  board  chairman  Darryn  Johnston  said  he  was  disappointed  with  the  decision   but  the  board  wanted  to  reassure  the  parents  who  had  signed  on.  ""We  remain  committed  to  building  a  school,""  Mr  Johnston  said.  ""But  we've  looked  at  the  options  and  they  are  fairly  limited  given  the  growth  of  the  town.""  And  he  said  the  board  would  discuss  its  options  as  soon  as  it  could  get  its  members  together.  About  50  students  had  registered  an  interest  in  attending  the  school,  with  Mr  Johnston  saying  there  were  many  more  waiting  to  see  how  the  project  progressed. ",2002-12-31

"  120  years  of  church   ST  Andrews  Anglican  Church  in  Elliston  is  celebrating  120  years  of  Christian  worship  on  Sunday,  December  1  at  11am.  In  1880,  for  the  sum  of  15  pounds  ($30)  allotment  128  of  the  township  of  Elliston  was  purchased  by  the  Society  of  the  Propagation  of  the  Gospel.  This  transaction  was  completed  on  May  4,  and  one  year  later  on  May  26  1881,  at  the  suggestion  of  Archdeacon  Farr,  it  was  decided  by  the  SPG  to  erect  a  school  room  that  could  be  used  for  Divine  Service,  Sunday  School  and  other  purposes.  The  Foundation  Stone  of  this  building  was  laid  in  August  1882  by  Miss  M.  Crowe  and  the  first  service  was  held  in  February,  1883.  In  December  1883  the  Society   agreed  to  allow  the  church  school  building  to  be  used  by  denominations  other  that  the  Church  of  England.  For  a  rental  of  12  pounds,  the  SPG  agreed  to  allow  the  building  to  be  used  for  a  court  room  in  1883.  The  room  was  also  rented  for  use  for  electoral  purposes  when  the  need  arose.  In  1884  the  building  ceased  to  be  used  as  a  court  room.  On  December  7,  1902  Bishop  John  Hamer  dedicated  St  Andrews  Church  of  England  in  Elliston.  St  Andrews  Church  is  in  the  Anglican  Ministry  of  Eyre  and  has  services  once  a  month  on  the  first  Sunday,  which  are  conducted  by  Rev  Lesley  McLean  who  lives  in  Cummins.  Celebrations  planned  for  Sunday  1st  December  are  well   in  hand  and  will  consist  of  a  Eucharist  and  Confirmation  service  at  11am  that  will  be  conducted  by  Bishop  Gary  Weatherill  Bishop  of  Willochra,  Rev  Lesley  McLean  and  visiting  clergy.  Following  the  service,  a  pooled  luncheon  will  be  held  at  the  Sports  Centre.  In  the  afternoon,  Sunday  School  picnic  activities  will  be  held  on  the  oval.  A  memorabilia  display  will  be  available  for  perusal  and  any  former  parishioners  and  visitors  are  very  welcome  to  attend.

"  Vatican  approves  decision   ROME  —  The  Vatican  welcomed  a  decision  by  Israel  to  stop  construction  of  a  mosque  near  the  main  Christian  shrine  in  Nazareth.  Vatican  spokesman  Joaquin  Navarro  Vails  said  Israel’s  decision  “re-established  legality  and  respect  for  holy  places  and  regard  for  the  respective  communities  of  believers”.  In  Nazareth,  however,  a  leader  of  the  Islamic  Movement  described  Israel’s  decision  as  a  declaration  of  war  against  Islam.  “We  defeated  the  Crusaders  800  years  ago,  and  we  will  defeat  the  enemies  of  Islam  today,”  said  Nazareth  Deputy  Mayor  Salman  Abu  Ahmed.  Plans  to  build  the  mosque  in  the  shadow  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Basilica  of  the  Annunciation  have  raised  tensions  between  Catholics  and  Muslims,  with  each  side  pressing  its  demands  on  Israel.

"  The  colour  of  success   Alton  Lee   AFRO-American,  Jewish,  Christian,  best-selling  author,  award-winning  musician,  journalist,  father,  hus  band,  son,  part-time  smoker,  cool  cat,  mensch.   When  James  McBride  enters  a  room,  the  label  appended  to  him  depends  upon  who  is  doing  the  appending.   In  Australia  to  promote  his  new  book,  Miracle  at  St  Anna,  Mr  McBride  made  his  name  with  the  remarkably  successful  1996  book  The  Color  of  Water.   He  wrote  the  latter  as  a  tribute  to  his  Jewish  mother,  who  fled  an  abu  sive  father  (an  Orthodox  rabbi),  married  an  Afro-American,  raised  12  children  on  her  own  and  estab  lished  a  Baptist  Church  in  Harlem.   Such  an  experience  might  lead  a  person  to  question  one’s  identity.  With  a  relaxed  shrug  of  the  shoul  ders,  McBride  dismisses  any  such   confusion:   “I  consider  myself  a  black  Christ  ian,  but  The  Color  of  Water  became  a  success  because  of  Jewish  women,  and  I  saw  the  best  side  of  the  Jewish  community—very  liber  al  and  compassionate  and  giving.”   The  experience  following  The   Color  of  Water’s  success  was  an   interesting  one  for  him,  with  both  black  and  Jewish  groups  wanting  to   claim  him.   Appropriation  by  the  Jewish  community  engendered  jealousy  in   some  black  groups,  for  which  he  makes  no  apology.  “The  Jewish  peo  ple  made  the  book  a  success;  what   can  I  do?”   Close  your  eyes  and  one  would  swear  he  was  almost  levelling  as  he  says  it.   Identity  and  appropriation  of  identity  are  themes  which  reflect  situations  in  which  others  find  themselves,  rather  than  his  own  place,  McBride  insists.   “I’m  still  the  same  guy  I  was  before  I  became  famous,  whether  blacks  or  whites  want  to  claim  me  as  their  own.”   He  laments  the  fact  that  there  is  a  commonality  between  black  and  Jewish  experience  that  does  not  translate  into  everyday  interaction.   The  artistic  history  of  the  Ameri  can  20th  century  is  the  massive  contribution  by  blacks  and  Jews,  often  in  unison.  Both  groups  have  suffered  greatly  and  both  have  a  tra  dition  of  returning  to  either  Africa  or  Europe  to  mitigate  the  experi  ence  of  suffering.   “For  a  while  relations  were  rocky  between  the  two  communities,  but  in  the  last  decade  it  has  changed  for   the  better.”   He  is  convinced  that  tribalism   has  a  key  role  in  creating  humani  ty’s  rich  cultural  tapestry,  although  it  often  ends  up  disen  franchising  people.  “A  society   where  the  divisions  between  groups  based  upon  ‘mine  is  better  than  yours’  or  ‘mine  is  more  impor   tant  than  yours’  can  rip  communi  ties  apart.”   Characterising  his  profession  as  “storyteller”,  McBride’s  first  love  is  music  —  he  plays  the  saxophone  and  used  to  play  in  a  quartet  —  even  though  words  have  been  his  meal  ticket  for  a  long  time,  first  as  a  journalist,  then  as  author.   “Artistically,  I  am  writing  with   words  and  with  music  so  as  to   affect  people  in  a  positive  way.”   Writing  does  this  through  words,  “which  are  often  open  to  greater  negative  misinterpretations  than  music.  But  music  arouses  greater  positive  passions  in  people.”   Miracle  at  St  Anna  is  a  fictional  account  set  during  World  War  II  of  four  American  soldiers  —  two  black,  one  white,  one  Puerto  Rican  —  way  laid  to  an  Italian  village  where  a  mir  acle  and  a  young  boy  lead  them  on  a  journey  of  self-discovery.   “Despite  the  despair  of  war,  mir  acles  can  happen,  and  despite  the  imperfections,  humanity  can  come  out  of  the  most  unlikely  places.  Not  all  Americans  were  good,  not  all  Ital  ians  were  bad,  and  so  on.  As  an  artist  I  am  always  trying  to  find  the  good  in  people.”   Although  he  believes  in  God  —  ”it  helps  get  me  through  the  day”  —  whether  the  belief  is  garbed  in  Christian,  Muslim  or  Jewish  motifs,  is  irrelevant  to  him.  “So  long  as  it  doesn’t  hurt  anyone  else,  so  be  it.  The  older  I  get  the  more  cynical  I  become  about  organised  religion,   James  McBride   but  my  belief  in  people  is  still  con   stant.”   How  does  he  explain  his  suc  cess?  “Luck  is  obviously  involved  but  a  lot  of  it  has  to  do  with  per   spective.  If  you  are  scared  of  change,  no  good  will  ever  come   your  way.   “But  if  you  make  small  choices  in  life,  often  they  add  up  to  big  things.” ",2002-05-03

Qu'ils  acceptent  que  le  Maître  Unique  de  toute  vie  ne  saurait  être  étranger  à  ce  départ  brutal.

Qu'ils  sachent  associer  cette  mort  à  tant  d'autres  aussi  violentes  laissées  dans  l'indifférence  de  l'anonymat.  Ma  vie  n'a  pas  plus  de  prix  qu'une  autre.

J'ai  suffisamment  vécu  pour  me  savoir  complice  du  mal  qui  semble,  hélas,  prévaloir  dans  le  monde,  et  même  de  celui-là  qui  me  frapperait  aveuglément.

Je  ne  saurais  souhaiter  une  telle  mort.  Il  me  paraît  important  de  le  professer.  Je  ne  vois  pas,  en  effet,  comment  je  pourrais  me  réjouir  que  ce  peuple  que  j'aime  soit  indistinctement  accusé  de  mon  meurtre.

Je  sais  le  mépris  dont  a  pu  entourer  les  Algériens  pris  globalement.  Je  sais  aussi  les  caricatures  de  l'Islam  qu'encourage  un  certain  islamisme.  Il  est  trop  facile  de  se  donner  bonne  conscience  en  identifiant  cette  voie  religieuse  avec  les  intégrismes  de  ses  extrémistes.  L'Algérie  et  l'Islam,  pour  moi,  c'est  autre  chose,  c'est  un  corps  et  une  âme.  Je  l'ai  assez  proclamé,  je  crois,  au  vu  et  au  su  de  ce  que  j'en  ai  reçu,  y  retrouvant  si  souvent  ce  droit  fil  conducteur  de  l'évangile  appris  aux  genoux  de  ma  mère,  ma  toute  première  Église,  précisément  en  Algérie,  et,  déjà  dans  le  respect  des  croyants  musulmans.  Ma  mort,  évidemment,  paraîtra  donner  raison  à  ceux  qui  m'ont  rapidement  traité  de  naïf  ou  d'idéaliste  :  «  Qu'il  dise  maintenant  ce  qu'il  en  pense  !  »  Mais  ceux-là  doivent  savoir  que  sera  enfin  libérée  ma  plus  lancinante  curiosité.  Voici  que  je  pourrai,  s'il  plaît  à  Dieu,  plonger  mon  regard  dans  celui  du  Père  pour  contempler  avec  Lui  ses  enfants  de  l'Islam  tels  qu'il  les  voit,  tout  illuminés  de  la  gloire  du  Christ,  fruits  de  Sa  Passion,  investis  par  le  Don  de  l'Esprit  dont  la  joie  secrète  sera  toujours  d'établir  la  communion  et  de  rétablir  la  ressemblance,  en  jouant  avec  les  différences.  Cette  vie  perdue,  totalement  mienne,  et  totalement  leur;  je  rends  grâce  à  Dieu  qui  semble  l'avoir  voulue  tout  entière  pour  cette  JOIE-là,  envers  et  malgré  tout.  Dans  ce  MERCI  où  tout  est  dit,  désormais,  de  ma  vie,  je  vous  inclus  bien  sûr,  amis  d'hier  et  d'aujourd'hui,  et  vous,  ô  amis  d'ici,  aux  côtés  de  ma  mère  et  de  mon  père,  de  mes  sœurs  et  de  mes  frères  et  des  leurs,  centuple  accordé  comme  il  était  promis  !  Et  toi  aussi,  l'ami  de  la  dernière  minute,  qui  n'aura  pas  sur  ce  que  tu  faisais.  Oui,  pour  toi  aussi  je  veux  ce  MERCI,  et  cet  à-DIEU  envisagé  de  toi.  Et  qu'il  nous  soit  donné  de  nous  retrouver,  larrons  heureux,  en  paradis,  s'il  plaît  à  Dieu,  notre  Père  à  tous  deux.  AMEN  !  Inch'Allah  !

"  Jews.  Christians.  Muslims  unite   Alton  Lee   THE  peak  national  representative  bodies  of  the  Australian  Jewish,  Muslim  and  Christian  communities  have  issued  a  joint  statement  encouraging  dialogue  as  “the  way  to  peace”  and  mutual  respect  between  religions  both  locally  and  in  the   Middle  East.   The  statement  also  condemns  “any  form  of  violence  arising  in  Australia  on  account  of  the  emotions   engendered  by  the  conflict  in  the  Middle  East,  including  expressions  of  racism  and  acts  of  vandalism  on  places  of  worship”.   Called  “A  time  for  peace”,  the  statement  is  endorsed  by  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  (ECAJ),  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils   (AFIC)  and  the  National  Council  of  Churches  in  Australia  (NCCA).  Co  signatories  to  the  statement  include  ECAJ  president  Jeremy  jones,  AFIC  chief  executive  officer  Amjad  Ali  Mehboob,  and  NCCA  representa   tives  Archbishops  Peter  Carnley,  Paul  Saliba,  Aghan  Baliozian,  Francis  Carroll  and  Reverend  Zeki  Zitoun  of  the  Syrian  Orthodox  Church.   “No-one  in  Australia  should   be  targeted  because   of  race,  creed  or  colour   and  there  should   certainly  be  no  attacks  on  places  of  worship.”   Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  CEO,   Amjad  All  Mehboob   ECAJ  president  Jeremy  Jones  described  the  statement  as  a  signifi  cant  document  that  reaffirms  the  “undeniable  and  incredible”  reser   voir  of  goodwill  in  Australia  from  people  of  different  backgrounds  to  live  in  peace  and  harmony.   “The  spirit  of  this  statement  is  one  of  compromise  and  doesn’t   make  any  moral  equivalence.  This  is  about  reaffirming  moral  principles.   “We  are  conscious  that  without  a  positive  affirmation  by  representa  tive  bodies  the  situation  can  give  a  free  run  to  people  who  want  to  poi  son  the  goodwill  that  exists  here,  “   Mr  Jones  said.   Of  particular  significance  was  the  involvement  of  AFIC,  which  Mr  Jones  described  as  “the  Islamic  represen  tative  body,  which  works  in  parallel  with  ECAJ  and  NCCA”.   AFIC  chief  executive  officer  Amjad  Ali  Mehboob  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  a  lot  of  problems  between  Australians  were  due  to  “ignorance”  and  “misunder  standings”  which  could  be  dispelled  by  building  better  relations.   “People  don’t  know  each  other  well  enough.  With  better  communi  cation  and  free  from  inhibitions  we  should  be  able  to  talk  like  adults.  It  is  in  this  context  that  we  call  upon  our  communities  to  work  together  and  live  together.”   Mr  Mehboob  said  it  was  impor  tant  that  a  distinction  was  made  in  communities  between  actions  that  offend  and  the  individuals  involved.  “No-one  in  Australia  should  be  tar  geted  because  of  race,  creed  or  colour  and  there  should  certainly  be  no  attacks  on  places  of  worship.”   The  declaration  follows  the  recent  joint  Jewish  and  Arab  state  ment  which,  though  it  called  for  negotiations  and  peace  in  the  Middle  East,  created  controversy  over  its  alleged  moral  equivalence  between  Palestinian  suicide  bombers  and  the  IDF’s  right  to  self-defence.  That  state  ment  was  signed  by  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman,  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  and  Sheikh  Tajedin  al  Hilaly,  well  known  for  his  anti-Israel  rhetoric.   The  NSW  Rabbincal  Council  dis  tanced  itself  from  the  previous  state  ment  and  ECAJ  president  Jeremy  Jones  and  ZFA  president  Ron  Weiser  had  refused  to  comment.   Mr  Rothman  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  it  was  encouraging  that  more  Arab  and  Muslim  bodies   and  figures  were  espousing  the  need  for  tolerance  and  dialogue.   NCCA  acting  general-secretary  Caesar  D’Mello  said  his  organisation  believed  it  was  imperative  to  act  because  of  the  situation  in  the  Middle  East.  “We  were  concerned  to  read  of  eight  Jewish  synagogues  being  spray  painted  with  graffiti.  Nothing  that  occurs  in  the  Middle  East  should  impact  negatively  on  communal  harmony  here,”  he  said.   OPINION:  Sheikh  Hilaly  and  the   peace  statement  —  page  17 ",2002-04-19
"  1550  Yeshiva  supporters  respond  to  September  11   Vi©  Mmd&amp;Sf   A  YESHIVA  College  function  which  honoured  a  Christian  woman  of  Lebanese  descent  —  NSW  Governor  Marie  Bashir  —  “is  a  powerful  response  to  the  evils  of  September  11"",  US  Senator  Joe  Lieberman  declared  last  week.   Speaking  by  satellite  from  Wash  ington,  he  was  addressing  1550  guests  at  the  Yeshiva  fundraiser  at  Darling  Harbour.   The  function  featured  a  thought  provoking  address  by  Rabbi  Chaim  Gutnick,  an  affirmation  of  solidarity  from  Governor  Bashir,  acknowledge  ment  of  benefactor  Harry  Triguboff  and  realisation  of  the  objective  of  raising  $1.2  million,  the  equivalent  of  120  $10,000  scholarships.   “If  everybody’s  pledge  comes  through,  we  will  have  met  the  goal,”  a  gratified  Yeshiva  dean  Rabbi  Pinchus  Feldman  remarked.   US  presidential  candidate  A1  Gore’s  running  mate  in  2000,  Senator  Lieberman  has  reportedly  put  for  ward  his  name  as  the  Democrat  nom  inee  for  the  presidency  in  2004—the  first  Jew  to  do  so.   Acknowledging  the  diverse  com  position  of  the  audience  at  the  func  tion,  he  said  the  Yeshiva  “has  demonstrated  that  the  differences  between  us  are  minimal.  We  are  all  children  of  the  same  God;  all  children  are  created  equal”.   “No  matter  what  our  race  or  reli   gion,  we  must  stand  and  band  togeth   er  to  defend  the  values  we  share  —  humane  values,  the  values  of  toler   ance.   “The  war  on  tyranny  and  terror  is  not  just  about  articulating  what’s  wrong  with  the  enemy’s  values,  but  what’s  right  with  our  own  values  and  the  fundamentals  on  which  we  stand.

Photo:  Nathan  Smith   H  Pictures,  page  29   “Respect  and  understanding  are  critical  to  any  society.  I’m  pleased  to  see  the  broad  support  the  Yeshiva  enjoys  and  its  positive  interaction  with  the  wider  community  ”   In  a  sweeping  address,  Rabbi  Chaim  Gutnick  ranged  from  criticis  ing  government  policy  on  asylum  seekers  to  urging  Australia  to  stand  with  the  US  in  “eradicating  evil”  to  condemning  Chief  Rabbi  Jonathan  Sacks  for  expressing  his  views  in  the   Guardian.   Saying  it  as  his  duty  to  raise  the   issue,  and  that  a  true  friend  respect  fully  points  out  another’s  errors,  he  said  he  had  “the  highest  respect”  for  the  Chief  Rabbi,  “but  nobody  is  infal   lible”.   “Israel  makes  mistakes,  but  it  has  the  right  to  defend  itself,  the  same  as  any  other  country.   “Of  all  the  media  I  know,  no  news  paper  has  been  so  consistently  anti   Israel  as  the  Guardian.  For  a  rabbi  to  allow  himself  to  be  interviewed  by  it  —  knowing  it  would  print  his  criti   cisms,  not  his  support  for  Israel  —  was  foolish.”   Rabbi  Gutnick  echoed  Senator  Lieberman’s  sentiments  in  saluting  the  “people  of  different  backgrounds,  religions  and  political  affiliations”  who  had  come  together  to  support  the  education  of  Yeshiva  students.   “It’s  not  their  responsibility,  yet  they  have  united  in  helping  others.  It  augurs  something  wonderful  for  this  community  and  this  country.   “I’d  like  to  believe  that  under  the   banner  of  the  Australian  flag,  we  lose  our  differences  and  become  one  —  united  as  the  Australian  people,  ded  icated  to  the  betterment  of  all  who  dwell  here,  dedicated  to  tolerate  and  respect  each  other.   “Maybe  then  we  can  eradicate  the  evil  that  dwells  within  us.”   Governor  Bashir  extolled  the  qualities  taught  at  the  Yeshiva  —  compassion,  charity,  empathy  and  acceptance  —  adding,  in  regard  to  September  11:  “It  is  important  not  to  despair,  but  to  raise  our  children  with  those  values”.   Following  her  to  the  podium,  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman  said  he  had  always  admired  Governor  Bashir’s  work  on  behalf  of  indigenous  people  and  racial  tolerance.  “A  person  of  such  erudition  who  spends  her  life  dedi  cated  to  human  rights  is  an  example  to  which  I  seek  to  aspire.”   Mr  Rothman,  who  has  been  assist  ing  the  Yeshiva  in  its  restructuring  in  recent  months,  said  the  college  “is  at  a  crossroads”.   “Without  Yeshiva,  the  community  would  be  significantly  worse  off,  and  we  would  have  a  generation  of  stu  dents  without  the  fundamentals  for  Jewish  continuity.   “But  it’s  time  to  professionalise,  and  Rabbi  and  Rebbetzin  Feldman  recognise  that,  which  is  why  so  many  have  given  of  themselves  to  help  that  process.  It  is  an  honour  to  have  been  asked  to  assist  with  the  alteration,  but  first  we  have  to  provide  educa  tion  for  the  students  already  there.”   The  Yeshiva  also  honoured  bene  factors  Ian  and  Sara  Miller,  Paul  Kommehl  and  administrator  Jim  Jen  nings.

"  Women  take  on  religion   Danya  Levy   MUSLIM,  Christian  and  Jewish  women  are  slowly  changing  their  respective  patriarchal  religions,  but  can  hasten  the  process  through  interfaith  dialogue,  an  international   Jewish  women’s  forum  found.   Representatives  from  New  South  Wales’  Christian,  Muslim  and  Jewish  communities  took  part  in  a  debate  at  the  International  Council  of  Jewish  Women’s  19th  Triennial  Convention  in  Sydney  this  week.   University  of  NSW  and  Sydney  University  comparative  religions  lecturer  Ruth  Lewin   led  the  forum.   “When  social  structures  break  down,  women  are  the  first  victims,”  she  told  the  convention.  “Social  structures  might  imprison  us  in  roles  and  positions  that  are  no  longer  valued  for  how  we  see  each  other  in  the  21st  century.”   Accepted  thinking  was  changing  and  now  depicted  religion  as  more  biological  than  cultural,  she  said.  “This  is  because  we  can  not  find  any  people  with  no  religion.”   Advances  in  women’s  rights  is  often  slow,  Peg  McEntee  of  the  Catholic  Women’s  League  said.  “We  want  everything  to  happen   at  once.”   Last  year  women  from  every  diocese  in  Australia  were  given  the  opportunity  to  make  a  statement  to  the  Catholic  Church  and  the  womens’  submissions  led  to  the  for  mation  of  the  Commission  of  Catholic  Women.   For  the  past  10  years  Muslim  and  Jewish  women  in  Sydney  have  been  communicating  after  communal  representatives  participat  ed  in  interfaith  dialogue  set  up  by  the  Uni  versity  of  Sydney.   Muslim  and  Jewish  women  worked   together  with  the  Family  Law  Court  last  year  on  an  understanding  of  women’s  religious  marriage  rights,  Jamila  Hussain  of  Sydney’s  University  of  Technology  explained.   “Consent  to  marry  is  essential  in  Islamic  law.  However,  there  are  a  number  of  igno  rant  men  still  following  cultural  laws.  They  are  the  people  forcing  their  daughters  to  marry.  The  right  to  divorce  has  always  been  there.”   Often  ignorance  is  the  biggest  problem  between  interfaith  relations,  she  said.  “We   need  to  help  others  to  understand  our  reli  gions.  We  need  to  exchange  ideas  and  work  together  on  prominent  issues.”   The  three  religions  have  a  lot  of  common  interests,”  Ms  Hussain  said.  “It’s  silly  for  three  people  to  do  the  same  thing  independ  ently  when  they  can  work  together  and  get  a  better  result.”   The  Koran  says  heaven  is  under  the  feet  of  mothers,  Wafa  Zaim  of  the  Muslim  Women’s  Association  said.  “She  is  moving  the  world  in  her  hand.”   Religion  is  often  confused  with  culture,  she  said,  citing  the  example  of  arranged  mar  riages,  which  is  a  cultural  matter,  not  an   issue  of  Islamic  law.   Wafa  Za!m  of  the  Muslim  Women's  Association,  convention  co-convenor  Miriam  Stein,  Jamlia  Hussain  of  Sydney’s  University  of  Technology.   The  association  works  with  schools  and  families  to  educate  both  students  and  teach  ers  about  women’s  rights.  “We  don’t  defend  people  culturally  -  we  don’t  defend  the  Lebanese,  Turkish  or  Egyptian  cultures.”   Women  have  a  substantial  role  to  play  in  interfaith  dialogue,  Rebbetzin  Leah  Berger  of  Chabad  Double  Bay  said.  “In  the  Torah  it  says  that  women  have  the  higher  form  of  understanding.  Everyone  has  a  different  make  up.  Physically  our  make-up  is  different  to  men’s  and  it’s  the  same  with  our  spiritual  make-up.”   Human  beings  are  more  important  than  rules  or  dogma,  Sydney  University  religion  department  associate  Dr  Colette  Rayment   said.   “Who  leads  religious  services  is  half  as  important  as  the  esoteric  values  of  religion.  If  we  get  into  the  esoterics  of  faith,  we  will  find  so  much  more  to  enrich  us  than  who  does  what.”   If  women  can  overcome  their  own  preju  dice,  they  will  take  a  huge  step  towards  changing  the  world,  she  said.  “If  we  as  women  go  about  condemning  divorced  women,  we  are  joining  the  male  hierarchy.  Embrace  women  who  dare  to  break  the  rules.”   All  three  religions  believe  women  have  a  role  in  creating  and  caring  for  the  universe,  independent  scholar  and  Reform  movement  teacher  Michelle  Stein-Evers  said.  “But  we   live  in  a  religious  society  which  says  some  thing  different.  It  says  that  if  you  don’t  have  that  chromosome  you  can’t  speak  from  a  pul  pit  or  give  a  dvar  Torah  if  you  are  in  a  mixed  company.  That  is  the  struggle  we  all  face.”   The  Progrerssive  tradition  is  just  as  opposed  to  change  in  some  quarters  as  the  Orthodox,  she  said.  “There  are  crazy  people  in  every  tradition.  Women  talk  to  each  other  and  find  out  whom  to  avoid.  We  must  remember  to  talk  to  each  other.”   There  is  much  to  learn  from  each  other,  Ms  Zaim  summarised.  “If  we  can  always  keep  our  mind  and  hearts  open  to  each  other,  we  can  listen,  respect  and  understand  each   other.” ",2002-05-31
"  College's  mission   River  City  Christian  College  is  on  a  mission  to  achieve  its  vision  of  100  students  enrolled  by  August  2.  College  principal  Alan  Beasy  said  it  was  a  challenge  to  the  community  to  look  at  what  the  school  offered,  and  try  to  achieve  the  impossible.  The  impossible  challenge  aims  to  enrol  30  new  students.  The  college  is  prepared  for  the  new  enrolments  with  renovations  to  the  school,  completed  at  the  beginning  of  the  year.  The  school,  which  has  70  students,  received  $75,000  through  a  Victorian  Government  Grant  initiative  to  help  needy  schools  unable  to  fund  repairs  and  maintenance  of  their  buildings.  The  new  refurbished  block  of  four  class  rooms,  which  was  started  in  early   January  and  finished  in  the  first  week  of  school,  was  freshly  painted  inside  and  out  and  now  has  a  new  verandah,  airconditioning  and  central  heating.  Another  dimension  of  the  refurbishment  was  the  new  roof  on  the  corridor  between  the  classrooms.  The  roof  was  lifted  and  glass  windows  were  added  to  let  more  sunlight  and  warmth  into  the  classrooms  that  were  previously  quite  dark.  ""I'm  absolutely  thrilled  with  the  outcome,  the  place  has  been  totally  transformed,""  Mr  Beasy  said.  The  college  has  also  recently  applied  for  another  grant  to  help  with  the  cost  of  extending  their  basketball  court.

In  his  speech  in  the  NSW  Parlia-  ment  (Nov  20),  Reverend  Nile  asked:  “Is  it  a  fact  that  the  Islamic  female  terrorists  in  Hamburg,  Ger  many,  and  in  the  recent  Muslim  ter  rorist  attack  in  Moscow,  Russia,  wore  the  black  chador  body  cover-  ing  of  Iran  and  Saudi  Arabia?”   This  was  omitt  ed  from  your  arti-  cle  on  the  subject.  As  was,  referring  to  the  Moscow  theatre,  “female  Muslim  terrorists  carried  explo-  sives  strapped  to  their  bodies.  Is  it  a  fact  that  many  Muslim  women  in  Turkey,  Egypt,  Indonesia  etcetera  only  wear  discreet,  Western-style  clothing  and  not  the  chador?”   These  comments  putting  the  rev-  erend’s  opinion  in  context  were  also  left  out  of  your  article.   Most  Christian  Australians  are  thinking  people,  ready  to  swoop  on  their  enemies  before  their  enemies  can  do  harm;  willing  to  stand  up  and  be  counted,  and  point  the  fin-  ger  at  possible  terror  threats.   This  is  precisely  why  both  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Premier  refused  (yes,  refused)  to  contradict,  let  alone  condemn,  the  good  rev-  erend’s  comments.   It’s  time  the  so-called  leaders  of  the  Jewish  community  exhibited  the  same  commitment  to  the  con-  tinuation  of  their  faith  that  our  Christian  neighbours  show  to   theirs.

Photo:  ingnd  shakenovsky   *  Report,  more  pictures,  next  week   Has  the  dialogue  broken  down?   HAS  the  Christian-Jewish  dialogue  broken  down?  This  issue  will  be  the  topic  of  a  Jewish  Free  University  forum  at  North  Shore  Synagogue  on  Sunday  evening.   Two  members  of  the  Catholic  religion  promi  nent  in  interfaith  dialogue  will  participate  in  the  discussion  —  Sister  Trish  Madigan  and  Paul  O’Shea,  both  of  whom  have  long  connections  with  the  Jewish  community.   Sister  Madigan  is  an  executive  member  of  the  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews,  a  mem  ber  of  the  Women’s  Interfaith  Network  and  a  delegate  to  the  Australian  National  Dialogue  of  Christians,  Muslims  and  Jews.   Mr  O’Shea  is  senior  religious  co-ordinator  at  St  Patrick’s  College,  StratMeld,  and  has  taught  courses  on  the  Holocaust  in  The  Shalom  Institute’s  Mosaic  program.  He  is  completing  a  doctorate  on  Pope  Pius  XII  and  the  Holocaust.   The  topic  has  been  prompted  by  trends  in  Jewish-Christian  relations,  including  the  Pope’s  failure  to  respond  adequately  to  antisemitic  statements  by  Syrian  President  Assad  two  years   ago.  It  has  also  been  asserted  that  the  Church  has  not  expressed  outrage  at  terrorist  attacks  on  Israeli  civilians,  especially  in  the  Pesach  mas  sacre  in  Netanya  which  claimed  29  lives.   Furthermore,  Jewish  and  Christian  leaders  differ  on  stem-cell  research  and  other  matters  of  medical  ethics,  and  this  is  another  point  which  will  be  explored.   Peter  Wertheim,  past  president  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  and  Peta  Jones  Pellach,  director  of  Adult  Education  at  The  Shalom  Institute,  will  take  part  in  the  debate.   Also  participating  will  be  the  former  execu  tive  director  of  the  South  African  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  Aleck  Goldberg,  who  recently  pub  lished  a  book  on  the  history  of  South  African  Jewry  and  will  sketch  the  state  of  Jewish  Christian  relationships  in  South  Africa.   Rabbi  David  Freedman  of  Kehillat  Masada  will  moderate  the  discussion,  which  will  be  held  in  the  Victor  Smith  Hall,  North  Shore  Synagogue.  The  synagogue  is  a  joint  sponsor  of  the  function,  which  will  be  on  October  20. ",2002-10-18
"  Close  finish  tipped  for  golf  classic   By  BRENDAN  ZANONI   Victorian  Nick  Dastey  and  New  South  Wales  golfer  Christian  McGill  were  tied  for  the  lead  at  the  halfway  mark  of  the  prestigious  PGA  Trainee  Professional  Golf  Classic  at  Rich  River  Golf  Club  Resort.  With  as  many  as  20  golfers  in  contention  at  the  halfway  mark  on  Wednesday,  today's  final  round  should  prove  a  thrilling  finale.  Results  from  round  three  of  the  tournament  played  yesterday,  were  unavailable  at  time  of  going  to  print.  Dastey  swept  to  the  lead  with  a  fantastic  round  in  tiring  conditions  on  Tuesday,  shooting  a  67  to  give  him  a  two  round  total  of  138,  six  under  par.  McGill  shot  a  one  under  round  71,  helping  him  to  a  share  of  the  lead,  as  he  had  after  the  first  round.  Dastey  is  a  third  (final)  year  trainee  from  Melbourne's  Long  Island  Golf  Club,  while  22-year-old  McGill,  a  former  state  level  baseball  pitcher,  is  a  first  year  trainee  at  Terrey  Hills  Golf  Club  in  Sydney.  Amazingly  18  golfers  were  within  five  shots  of  the  lead  pair,  and  53  of  the  126  competing  were  within  10  shots.  PGA  Australia  national  training  coordinator  Nick  Mooney  said  the  quality  of  golf  had  been  impressive  so  far.  ""Dastey  shot  a  67  (on  Tuesday)  in  tough  conditions.""  Mooney  said.  ""(It  was)  hot  and  blustery.  ""Scores  have  been  very  impressive  so  far  considering  the  conditions  and  it's  a  very  difficult  course.""  Co-leader  after  round  one,  Victorian  Sean  Charleston  was  unable  to  handle  the  conditions,  however,  shooting  a   79,  tied  in  32nd  position  after  round  two.  Last  year's  winner  Denny  Vera  had  carded  rounds  of  69  and  71,  and  sat  two  shots  off  the  pace.

"  OBITUARY   A  Life  Full  of  Unrealised  Potential  Stem  Cell  R475  4  February  2001  -  7  April  2002   Members  of  the  Christian  community  are  devastated  today  by  the  loss  of  one  of  Australia's  most  promising  stem  cells.  Cell  R475  was  disposed  of  after  refusing  to  participate  in   ground-breaking  medical  research.  ""It's  so  devastating  when  young  lives  are  lost  like  this.  It  had  so  much  potential""  said  Linda  Shellings,  President  of  the  Christian  Coalition  for  Life,  which  opposes  the  use  of  human  embryos  for  stem  cell  research.  ""It  could  have  become  anything  -  a  great  artist,  a  lawyer,  or  even  spleen  tissue.  Now  we'll  never  know.""  R475's  death  brings  to  an  end  a  brief  and  sad  potential  life.  Generated  in  early  2001  as  a  part  of  the  IVF  program,  the  stem  cell  had  no  real  contact  with  its  biological  father,  a  cash-strapped  university  student  who  donated  his  sperm  in  return  for  a  small  amount  of  cash  and  easy  access  to  low  grade  pornography.  From  the  start,  the  cell's  existence  was  marked  by  division.  Reared  in  a  cramped  test  tube,  its  early  home  life  was  unstable  and  subject  to  constant  change.  R475's  family  would  have  outgrown  their  humble  environment  had  they  not  been  stifled  by  freezing  conditions  that  stunted  their  growth.  They  spent  most  of  2001  and  early  2002   in  permafreeze  with  fellow  embryo  cells.  Things  had  looked  up  for  R475  in  2002  when  it  was  recruited  from  a  competitive  field  of  around  60,000  possible  entrants  to  participate  in  medical  research  that  saw  it  finally  broken  free  from  its  nucleus  family.  Unfortunately,  R475's  devout  Christian  faith  wouldn't  allow  it  to  take  part  in  the  ground-breaking  research,  meaning  almost  certain  disposal.  R475  shared  its  confusion  with  reporters  moments   before  its  execution,  ""'This  research  is  completely  immoral.  But  refusing  to  participate  in  it  is  akin  to  suicide  and  suicide  is  also  sin,  so  I'm  not  exactly  sure  what  to  do.  This  is  a  pretty  heavy  ethical  dilemma  for  a  unicellular  organism.""  It  was  survived  by  a  plethora  of  identical  siblings  and  a  grieving  embryo.  ""It's  terrible  when  you  outlive  your  progeny""  the  distraught  embryo  said  at  a  memorial  service  attended  by  only  a  few  other  cells. ",2002-04-12

"  Learning  about  law   FACE  To  Face,  the  accused  front  the  victims.  As  part  of  Law  Week  our  Year  11  Legal  Studies  class  took  part  in  a  mock  Family  Conference.  The  conference  was  directed  by  Eric  Kaseru  a  Youth  Justice  Coordinator  from  the  Adelaide  Youth  Court.  Other""  participants  included  Deanie  Roach,  a  court  companion  supporting  one  of  the  victims  and  Senior  Constable  Hans  Minchin  from  the  Port  Lincoln  Police:  .  Family  Conferences  involve  the  accused,  the  victims,  relevant  witnesses,  police  representatives,  a  Youth  Justice  Coordinator  and  parents.  The  police  refers  youths  to  a  Family  Conference  only  if  they,  have  admitted  to  committing  the  crime.  If  they  deny  the  crime  the  case  goes  directly  to  court.  Our  mock  trial  involved  us  taking  roles  of  juveniles  who  had  admitted  to  a  minor  indictable  offence.  In  our  case,  four  teens  were  accused  of  ill  treating  three  horses.  We  were  given  statements.  that  •  the  accused  and  victims  had  made  ;  at  the  time-of  the  offence  and  when  they  were  interviewed  later  by  police.  ;  From  these  statements  we  had  to  act   out  the  roles  of  the  people  involved  in  the  conference.  As  a  result  of  participating  in  the  simulation  we  found  that  the  Family  Conference  was  often  more  emotional  and  personal  than  a  court  case,  due  to  the  accused  coming  face  to  face  with  the  distressed  victims.  During  the  conference  we  expressed  our  thoughts  about  the  incident  and  how  we  thought  the  people  involved  would  have  felt  at  the  time.  The  Youth  Justice  Coordinator  asked  questions  about  the  crime.  The  accused  then  had  the  opportunity  to  apologise  to  the  victims  and  show  remorse  for  the  suffering  they  caused.  The  victims  were  then  able  to  state  how  they  would  like  to  be  compensated  for  their  loss  and  an  agreement  was  made  between  both  the  accused  and  the  victims.  In  total  around  $25,000  was  paid  to  the  victims  by  the  accused.  After  completing  our  conference  we  were  informed  that  the  crime  we  had  acted  out  had  actually  occurred.  It  was  quite  ironic  how  close  our  reenactments  were  to  the  real  case.  It  was  hard  to  imagine  how  a  bit  of  fun  turned  out  to  be  a  very  serious  and  expensive  offence  for  those  involved.   Overall  the  class  thought  it  was  a  great  opportunity  to  learn  more  about  the  process  taken  when  a  juvenile  commits  a  crime.  It  appears  to  be  a  valuable  process  as  the  victims  have  involvement  in  the  penalties  set.   and  Ebony  Christian.

"  World  Vision  changes   tune  on  anti-Israel  stance   Alana  Rosenbaum   WORLD  Vision  has  backed  away  from  its  anti  Israel  stance  that  caused  a  rift  between  the  Christian  agency  and  the  Jewish  community.   In  an  interview  with  the  Australia/Israel  and  Jewish  Affairs  Council  publication,  the  Review,  World  Vision  Australia’s  chief  executive  Lynn  Arnold  criticised  a  parliamentary  submission  on  Israel  that  the  organisation  issued  in  2000.   The  submission  advocated  Palestin  ian  right  of  return  —  widely  held  to  mean  the  destruction  of  Israel.  It  also  claimed  that  settle  ments  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  were  illegal,  and  that  Israel  denied  Pales  tinians  free  religious  expression.   “There  are  many   Rabbi  John  Levi   flaws  in  this  submission,”  Mr  Arnold  admitted.  “There  are  a  number  of  statements  that,  by  themselves,  without  counterbalancing  state  ments,  create  not  unreasonably  the  sorts  of  reactions  we  have  heard  from  a  number  of  people  in  the  Jewish  community.   “It  is  not  actually  our  business  to  be  involved  in  the  politics  of  this  matter.”   World  Vision  and  the  Australian  Jewish  community  have  been  feuding  since  the  1980s.  Relations  were  at  their  lowest  in  1990,  when   World  Vision  lobbied  the  government  to  impose  economic  sanctions  against  Israel.   Temple  Beth  Israel  Rabbi  John  Levi  responded  with  a  call  to  Australian  Jewry  to  boycott  World  Vision.   Asked  about  the  organisation’s  history  of  hostility  to  Israel,  Mr  Arnold,  a  former  South  Australian  premier,  said:  “I  acknowledge  that  within  World  Vision  there  are  people  who  have  strident  personal  views  on  the  Middle  East  on  both  sides  of  the  debate.  I  am  aware  of  docu  ments  that  have  been  the  cause  of  concern.”   However,  Mr  Arnold  assured  that  World  Vision  believes  in  Israel’s  right  to  exist,  and  does  not  support  Palestinian  right  of  return.   Also  at  issue  is  the  World  Vision  website,  which  provides  a  link  to  the  Palestinian  Authority  website,  without  including  a  link  to   the  Israeli  Government.  Mr  Arnold  said  he  was  “very  concerned”  over  the  omission.  “We  should  have  both  official  views  or  neither.”   World  Vision  assists  developing  communi  ties.  It  provides  aid  to  Palestinians  and  has  a  history  of  advocating  on  their  behalf.   However,  Mr  Arnold  denied  that  it  was  hos  tile  to  Jews.  “People  don’t  believe  we  hear  the   tears  of  the  families  of  the  kids  killed  in  the   pizza  bar  or  on  the  school  bus  ...  They  don’t  believe  we  hear  the  fears  of  ordinary  citizens  in  a  democracy,  which  Israel  is,  fearing  for  their  lives  and  their  security,”  he  said.   “There  was  a  fabulous  story  of  World  Vision  staff  working  with  rabbis  in  Israel  to  replant  olive  trees  in  Palestinian  land.  I  thought,  why  didn’t  World  Vision  talk  about  that?” ",2002-03-15

In  1971  a  choir  from  the  church  went  to  Israel  on  a  concert  tour.  At  one  of  the  concerts  Anne  Frank’s  father,  Otto,  was  in  the  audience.   Impressed  by  the  performance  Mr  Frank  gave  the  group  several  specially-bred   rose  bushes  called  Souvenir  d’Anne  Frank.   In  honour  of  Anne  Frank’s  hope  for  peace,  JCFI  —•  which  was  established  in  1946  —  built  a  church  in  Nishinomiya  in  1980.   Special  memorial  rooms  at  the  church  are  filled  with  memorabilia  from  Anne  Frank  donated  by  her  father,  together  with  photo  graphs  and  documents  of  the  Holocaust.   The  garden  has  as  its  centrepiece  a  bronze  statue  of  Anne  Frank  which  is  surrounded  by  a  mass  of  beautiful  roses.   During  the  past  30  years  more  than  10,000  Souvenir  d’Anne  Frank  roses  have  been  plant  ed  throughout  Japan.

With  a  budget  approaching  zero  he  has  opted  for  Barbie  doll  performers,  which   works  surprisingly  well.  There's  also  no  denying  the  quality  of  Bush's  voice  or  the  innovation  of  some  of  his  concepts  such  as  the  curiously  compelling  Jesus  pinata.  But  there  are  only  so  many  amputee  jokes  out  there  and  whatever  that  number  is  Bush  has  stuck  a  zero  next  to  it.

"  CÉRÉMONIES  DU  11  NOVEMBRE.   Cette  année  les  cérémonies  du  11  Novembre  avaient  un  cac  particulier.  En  effet  les  Anciens  Combattants  Français  d'Adé  avaient  avec  eux  le  Sénateur  Christian  Cointat,  arrivé  la  veille  effectuait  une  visite  Officielle  en  Australie,  ainsi  que  leur  Délé  au  CSFE,MadameJeannine  Sandmeyer.   En  ce  i  1  Novembre  la  chaleur  ai  registrée  38o  n'avait  pas  découragé  plus  de  1000  personnes  de  toutes  nationalités  civils  et  militaires  qui  se  pressaient  devant  ce  magnifique  Mémorial  qui  représente  si  bien  la  reconnaissance  et  l'amour  dû  à  tous  ceux  qui  sont  morts  pour  que  vive  la  liberté.  Un  détachement  de  deux  cents  hommes  des  forces  de  l'ONU  renforçait  sensiblement  les  forces   àtiH  c  u  militaires  habituelles.  Après  le  dépôt  de  gerbes  à  laquelle  participèrent  le  Sénateur  Christian  Cointat  et  notre  Consul  Honoraire,  Madame  Anne  Levy,  la  cérémonie  principale  terminée,  le  groupe  des  français  se  dirigea  vers  le  Monument  Français  où  Monsieur  Christian  Cointat  accompagné  de  Mesdames  jeannine  Sandmeyer  et  Anne  Levy,  et  de  Messieurs  Daniel  Lys  et  William  Corneloup,  déposa  une  couronne  au  nom  de  la  Section.

"  VISITE  INTENSIVE  DU  SENATEUR  COINTAT  EN  AUSTRALIE   Le  sénateur  Christian  COINTAT,  représentant  depuis  le  10  oc  2001  au  Palais  du  Luxembourg  les  Français  établis  à  l'étranger  (  avait  entrepris  l'été  dernier  de  rendre  visite  à  la  communauté  fran  çaise  du  Japon  (5221  immatriculés),  partie  d'une  région  du  mon  que  le  sénateur  affectionne  (2).   ésenfaire  Ce  projet  fut  relevé  lors  de  la  55ème  session  plénière  du  Conseil  Supérieur  des  Français  de  l'Etranger,  à  Paris  début  septembre  (3),  par  notre  «  déléguée  CSFE  »  du  Victoria,  Mme  Janine  Sandmayer,  membre  du  groupe  UFE-R  (4),  laquelle  fit  aussitôt  une  suggestion  :  à  son  retour  sur  Paris,  M.  le  Sénateur  se  devait  de  «  passer  par  l'Australie  »  !  Certes,  l'on  ne  parlait  pas  de  la  Lorraine,  mais  assurément  des  mêmes  longitudes,  donc  des  mêmes  fuseaux  horaires  :  tout  au  plus,  l'équateur  à  franchir...  Sitôt  pensé,  sitôt  décidé,  d'autant  plus  que  le  nombre  d'immatriculés  dans  notre  belle  Australie  ne  cesse  d'augmenter-  près  de  14  400  à  ce  jour  «Monsieur  Cointat?»  Pour  beaucoup  de  nos  compatriotes,  de  plus  en  plus  jeunes  semble-t-il,  ce  nom  disait  quelque  chose,  mais  qui  se  souvenait  de  Michel  Cointat,  ministre  UDR  (5)  de  l'agriculture  du  président  Pompidou  (2ème  gouvernement  Chaban-Delmas)  de  janvier  1971  à  juillet  1972  ?...  De  cette  personnalité  gaulliste  qui  avait  participé  à  un  chapitre  décisif  pour  l'Union  européenne,  celui  de  l'élargissement  de  l'Europe  des  Six  à  l'Europe  des  Neuf?  ...  Les  limbes,  pour  beaucoup  !...  «  Hé  oui  !  le  fils  de  son  père  »  -  mais  le  sénateur  a  un  autre  prénom  :  Christian.  Né  en  1943,  il  connaît  bien  la  Nouvelle  Calédonie  où  il  dirigea,  dans  sa  jeunesse,  une  exploitation  forestière,...  avant  de  reprendre  ses  études  -  en  droit  -  et  de  se  faire  une  carrière  dans  les  institutions  européennes  :  admis  fonctionnaire  du  Parlement  de  Luxembourg.  Christian  Cointat  y  gravir  tes  ecneions  pour  en  devenir  directeur  général.  Marié  à  une  Italienne,  elle-rriine   fonctionnaire  européenne,  père  de  deux  enfants,  Christian  Cointat  s'intéressa  à  ses  compatriotes  du  Luxembourg.  Il  s'occupa  d'eux,  et  ceux-ci  lui  en  surent  gré.  En  1983,  ils  le  déléguèrent  au  CSFE,  puis  l'an  dernier,  au  Sénat,  pour  y  reprendre  le  siège  de  Paul  d'Ornano,  démissionnaire  pour  raisons  de  santé  (6).  Dans  ce  contexte,  la  tournée  australienne  de  M.  Cointat  ne  pouvait  que  commencer  par  Adélaïde  (10-  12  novembre),  où  Mme  Sandmayer  s'en  fut  l'accueillir  aux  côtés  de  M.  William  Corneloup,  président  de  la  Fédération  des  anciens  combattants  d'Australie  et  délégué  général  en  Australie  de  la  FACS  (7).  M.  Corneloup  organisait  le  lendemain  11  novembre,  en  liaison  ave  la  RSL  d'Australie  méridionale,  les  cérémonies  du  Souvenir,  et  attachait  un  prix  particulier  à  pouvoir  compter  sur  la  présence  du  sénateur  (voir  par  ailleurs).  Cette  visite  à  Adélaïde  allait  aussi  permettre  à  M.  Cointat  de  rencontrer  nombre  de  Français  expatriés  (à  l'Alliance  Française,  accueillis  par  le  nouveau  directeur,  M.  Jean-François  Duclos).  Mme  Ann  Levy,  Consule  honoraire  de  France,  recevrait  pour  sa  part  à  dîner  en  son  honneur  diverses  personnalités  franco-australiennes.  Ce  schéma  fut  répété  pour  la  seconde  étape,  celle  de  Melbourne  (12-14  novembre),  où  le  programme  établi  par  Janine  Sandmayer  permis  au  sénateur  d'apprécier  les  «  piliers  »  de  la  communauté  française  :  la  chambre  de  commerce  FACCI  (déjeuner  avec  la  communauté  d'affa  l'Alliance  Franca^  Je  Melbourne  (visite  des  nouveaux  locaux  avec  le  Sirecteur  adjoint,  Hélène  Raimundo)  et  la  Petite  Ecole  Française  de  Caulfield  (présentation  des  classes  par  la  directrice,  Marie-Christine  Serey),  et  le  lendemain,  nombre  de  nos  com-   ?   patriotes  du  monde  combattant  et  associatif  invités  par  notre  déléguée  pour  un  dîner  campagnard.  La  Consule  Générale  Honoraire  de  France,  Mme  Patricia  Polites,  avait  quant  à  elle,  en  tant  que  personnalité  notable  de  la  ville,  offert  la  veille  au  sénateur  un  somptueux  dîner  au  Melbourne  Savage  Club.  Lieu  réservé  aux  membres  des  professions  libérales  de  la  City,  ce  «  club  »  date  des  années  de  moralisme  presbytérien  prévalant  au  début  des  années  1900's,  lorsque  les  débits  de  boissons  étaient  interdits  après  18heures:  pour  la  consommation  hors  de  ce  créneau  horaire,  il  fallait  donc  être  «discret»  -  connaître  cette  bonne  adresse  (pas  de  plaque  côté  rue),  et  montrer  patte  blanche  avant  d'être  admis...  L'endroit  abrite  en  outre  des  objets  insolites:  des  oeuvres  d'art  mélanésien  et  océanien,  des  trophées  de  chasse  et  autres  dépouilles,  et  tout  un  décor  prisé  par  les  plus  joyeux  briscards  (fumoir,  bar...),  sans  omettre  quelques  portraits  en  pied  de  beautés  locales,  -  blanches,  et  dans  leurs  plus  beaux  atours...  Une  bonne  initiation,  somme  toute,  à  une  mé-   tropole  réputée  pudibonde.  La  troisième  étape  ,  a  Canberra  (14  novembre)  fut  plus  classique  :  déjeuner  de  finegastronomie  offert  à  la  résidence  par  l'ambassadeur  de  France  et  Mme  Pierre  Viaux,  suivi  d'une  visite  de  l'école  franco-australienne  de  Telopea  Park,  et  d'un  dîner  enfin  avec  M.  Peter  Curtis,  ancien  ambassadeur  australien  à  Paris  et  président  fédérai  de  l'Alliance  Française  en  Australie.  Puis  ce  fut  au  tour  de  Sydney  (15  et  16  novembre),  avec  notamment  un  dîner  offert  à  leur  résidence  par  le  consul  général  de  France  et  Mme  Marc  Finaud  :  une  pause  de  travail  au  terme  d'une  lourde  journée  pour  le  sénateur,  toujours  accompagné  de  Mme  Sandmayer,  et  aussi  désormais  par  notre  «  délégué  CSFE»  du  NSW,  M.

Le  groupe  des  députés  RCV  (Verts,  Citoyens  et  Radicaux  de  gauche)  a  déposé  une  proposition  de  loi  choisissant  la  date  du  19  mars  comme  journée  nationale  du  souvenir  pour  les  victimes  Civiles  et  Militaires  de  la  guerre  d'Algérie,  du  Maroc  et  de  Tunisie.  Ce  texte  repris  par  le  gouvernement  pour  devenir  un  projet  de  loi  est  actuellement  très  controversé,  une  seule  association  le  soutien.  Dans  une  lettre  expédiée  à  tous  les  députés,  Hugues  Dalleau  Président  Général  de  l'UNC  expose  le  pourquoi  du  NON  catégorique  prononcé  non  seulement  par  l'UNC  mais  aussi  par  toutes  les  Associations  sauf  une.  Pour  nous  cette  date  insulte  la  mémoire  de  ceux  qui  sont  morts  pour  la  France  et  non  pour  l'indépendance  de  l'Algérie.  Nous  avons  encore  dans  nos  pensées  les  massacres  après  le  19  mars  des  haïkis  ou  autres  supplétifs  engagés  sous  notre  drapeau  et  des  civils  français  égorgés  ou  disparus.

"  LA  BIERE  :  ALIMENT  DE  SANTE  ?   Comme  l'explique  le  Pr  Christian  Brohet  (UCL),  a  l'inaug  tion  d'un  centre  d'information  sur  la  bière  réalisé  a  l'initiati  des  Brasseurs  belges  (1),  les  études  récentes  menées  sur  un  to  de  quelque  300.000  sujets  montrent  que  l'effet  ""cardioprote  teur""  de  la  bière  est  comparable  a  celui  du  vin.   Si  le  jus  de  la  treille  peut  tabler  sur  des  composes  tels  que  le  resveratrol  ou  la  quercetine,  la  bière  recèle  des  phyto-oestrogenes,  des  flavonoides  et  même  quelques  vitamines  du  groupe  B  qui  exercent  aussi  une  action  bénéfique  pour  le  coeur  et  les  vaisseaux.  Pour  le  cardiologue,  ce  n'est  pas  tant  le  type  de  boisson  alcoolisée  qui  importe  mais  la  façon  dont  elle  est  consommée  :  au  cours  des  repas,  dans  un  esprit  de  convi-   vialité  et  avec  modération  (soit  1  a  2  verres  par  jour  pour  les  femmes,  2  a  3  pour  les  hommes).  S'il  y  a  bien  une  spécificité  dans  les  ingrédients  mis  en  oeuvre  pour  la  fabrication  de  la  bière,  c'est  le  recours  au  houblon.  Cette  plante  est  utilisée  depuis  des  siècles  pour  parfumer  le  breuvage.  Elle  fait  l'objet  d'un  regain  d'intérêt  depuis  la  découverte  de  molécules  dotées  d'une  activité  biologique  qui,  selon  le  Pr  Vincent  Castronovo   (Ulg),  semblent  prometteuses  dans  le  domaine  du  cancer.  Ainsi,  la  8-prenylnaringenine  du  houblon  favorise  l'adhésion  des  cellules  en  vue  de  maintenir  une  architecture  normale,  ce  qui  permet  de  ""séquestrer""  les  cellules  cancéreuses  susceptibles  d'envahir  d'autres  tissus.  Elle  n'empêche  pas  la  survenue  de  cellules  cancéreuses  mais  réduit  leur  dangerosité.  Un  autre  compose  du  houblon,  l'humulone,  serait  a  même  d'inhiber  l'angiogenese,  c'est-à-dire  le  développement  d'un  nouveau  réseau  de  vaisseaux  destine  a  alimenter  une  tumeur.  Ce  ""blocus  alimentaire""  de  la  tumeur  limite  ainsi  son  aptitude  a  se  développer.  La  8-prenylnaringenine  fait  partie  des  phyto-oestrogenes,  des  composes  qui  se  fixent  sur  les  récepteurs  aux  oestrogenes  pour  reproduire,  avec  une  puissance  nettement  moindre,  les  effets  des  oestrogenes  humains.  Cela  signifie  qu'avant  la  ménopause,  lorsque  ces  hormones  sont  pressentes,  ces  phyto-oestrogenes  diminuent  l'im-  ées  ond  ien   prégnation  hormonale,  puisqu'elles  sont  moins  actives  mais  occupent  les  récepteurs,  limitant  l'effet  des  œstrogènes  de  l'organisme.  Or,  l'imprégnation  en  hormones  femelles  est  avancée  comme  un  mécanisme  clé  dans  le  développement  du  cancer  du  sein  et  celui  de  la  prostate,  poursuit  le  Dr  Castronovo.  C'est  en  partie  a  la  richesse  de  l'alimentation  en  phyto-oestrogenes  du  soja  que  l'on  attribue  la  faible  prévalence  du  cancer  du  sein  dans  les  pays  asiatiques.  Mais  jusqu'à  présent,  rien  de  tel  n'a  été  observe  chez  les  buveurs  de  bière  !  Contrairement  a  l'effet  cardioprotecteur,  qui  repose  sur  un  socle  solide  d'arguments  issu  d'études  humaines,  l'effet  anticancerigene  de  la  bière  relève  pour  l'heure  exclusivement  du  laboratoire  et  il  serait  hasardeux  d'en  tirer  la  moindre  conclusion  chez  l'homme.

"  J  ^  ^  QPMTOMS   i  l  T  1  BY  3»™  —  J   For  CENTURIES  the  Christian  Church  has  condemned  homosexuals,  but  there  has  been  no  suggestion  from  the  bible  of  how  to  'deal'  with  this  problem.  While  there  have  been  many  movements  that  attempt  to  convert  homosexuals  to  heterosexuals,  reality  has  been  disagreeing  with  the  ex-gay  movement  for  a  long  time.  Many  studies  have  shown  that  'ex-gays'  are  in  fact  frauds  and  that  the  movement  itself  is  a  proponent  of  that  fraudulence.  In  the  book  The  Third  Sex,  the  author  Kent  Philpott,  makes  claims  that  people  have  successfully  changed  their  sexuality,  with  his  Love  in  Action""  program.  One  of  the  people  featured  in  the  book,  John  Evans,  very  publicly  stated  that  he  is  in  fact  gay,  in  his  book  entitled  Ex-Cays,  There  Are  None.  The  Ex-Gay  Movement  and  their  Christian  counterparts  have  been  around  since  the  late  70's  and  can  be  seen  as  a  conservative  response  to  the  Queer  movement  in  that  era.  Famous  ex-gay  activist,  artist  Anita  Bryant  and  her  group  'Save  Our  Children'  was  able  to  repeal  a  gay  rights  ordinance  in  Florida  in  1977.  She  stated  publicly  that  gay  people  were  'wicked  and  Godless'  and  that  they  wanted  to  recruit  the  children  of  America.  The  Queer  movement  was  quick  to  respond  to  her  homophobic  message,  and  were  responsible  for  her  losing  her  position  as  the  [American]  Citrus  Commission's  spokesperson  and  the  rapid  decline  of  her  singing  career.  But  more  sinister  organisations  would  soon  pop  up  such  as  'God  Hates  Fags'  with  their  Reverend  Father  Phelps,  pride  themselves  on  how  they  disrupted  the  funeral  of  M  a  t  t  h  e  w   Shepard,  a  murdered  young  gay  man,  telling  the  funeral-goers  that  would  burn  in  hell.  Some  followers  Christian  groups  justify  the  hatred  and  violence  of  gays  based  on  scriptures  from  the  Bible,  written  in  the  Old  Testament.  The  two  individual  scriptures  are  both  in  Leviticus  (18:22,  20:13),  a  chapter  that  codes  behavior,  also  condemning  the  cutting  of  a  male's  hair  around  the  temples,  and  allows  for  the  sale  of  one's  daughter  to  slavery.  But  unlike  the  latter,  the  rules  regarding   homosexuality  have  not  been  ruled  irrelevant  to  the  modern  world.  It  makes  one  ask  why  the  ban  against  homosexuality  is  the  only  thing  still  preached?  Is  it  because  of  a  fear  of  homosexuals  or  is  it  just  the  church  persecuting  people  they  don't  like  or  that  are  different?  In  the  New  Testament  the  only  time  homosexuality  is  mentioned  is  in  the  letters  to  the  Romans  and  then  by  Paul  (Romans  1:18-32):  ""For  the  wrath  of  God  is  revealed  from  heaven  against  all  ungodliness  and  wickedness  of  men  who  by  their  wickedness  suppress  the  truth.  /.../  For  this  reason  God  gave  them  up  to  dishonourable  passions.  Their  women  exchanged  natural  relations  for  unnatural,  and  the  men  likewise  gave  up  natural  relations  with  women  and  were  consumed  with  passion  for  one  another,  men  committing  shameless  acts  with  men  and  receiving  in  their  own  persons  the  due  penalty  for  their  error.""  There  is  a  lot  said  about  this  rejection  of  homosexuality,  butas  Reverend  Greg  Smith  states:  'most  reputable  scholars  believe  that  Paul  was  referring  to  the  homosexual  temple  prostitution  which  was  performed  by  various  cults.'  (See  'Homosexuality  is  not  a  Sin'  by  Rev.  Greg  Smith).  Up  until  the   19  th  Century  the  social-psychological  relationship  to  homosexuality  was  not  discovered,  so  it  is  unlikely  Paul  was  referring  to  homosexual  love,  but  rather  heterosexual  men  engaging  in  homosexual  acts   for  money.   Furthermore,  there  are  three  classic  examples  of  homosexual  love  described  in  the  Bible.  The  clearest  was  that  between  David  and  Jonathan.  Jonathan  was  the  heir  and  son  of  King  Saul,  David  went  on  marrying  Saul's  daughter  Michal.  There  is  evidence  in  the  Bible  text  that  they  had  a  relationship  much  deeper  than  friendship,  maybe  even   as  far  as  a  sexual  one.  However  when  translators  interpret  the  Holy  Scripture  they  sometimes  omit  it,  or  sometimes  just  choose  other  words  for  it.  An  example  of  this  is  when  Saul  contemplates  the  benefits  of  marrying  David  off  with  Michal,  and  he  says  that:  ""Thou  shalt  this  day  be  my  son  in  law  in  the  one  of  the  twain""  (King  James  Version).  In  the  King  James  Version  the  sentence  seems  to  relate  to  Saul's  older  daughter,  rather  than  to  Jonathan,  but  B.A.  Robinson  claims  that  this  sentence  was  misinterpreted  and  that  the  translators  even  added  words  that  did  not  exist  in  the  Hebrew  original.  King  Saul  seems,  according  to  Robinson,  on  the  contrary,  to  acknowledge  the  relationship  between  David  and  Jonathan.  There  are  lots  of  things  in  the  Bible  that  are  not  followed  word  for  word  in  our  modern  society  and  to  understand  the  Bible  there  are  a  lot  of  rules  and  restrictions  for  reinterpretation.  Priests  from  all  over  the  world,  from  all  dominions  of  Christianity,  are  slowly  starting  to  rethink  the  tenets  of  Christianity  and  its  standpoint  against  homosexuality.  There  are,  of  course,  dangers  with  this  too!  Some  churches  (e.g.  Church  of  Sweden)  accept  homosexuals  as  individuals  within  the  ch  urch,  and  allow  them  to  partake  of  communion  as  long  as  they  are  not  sexually  active  with  partners  of  the  same  sex.  The  message  is  clear,  to  be  homosexual  is  okay,  as  long  as  the  homosexual  does  not  build  meaningful  relationships,  or  lead  something  close  to  a  healthy  life.   Fortunately,  there  are  Christian  dominions  out  there  who  welcome  eating,  breathing,  proud  homosexuals.  If  you  are  a  Christian  homosexual  it  is  not  the  end  of  the  world.  You  will  just  have  to  shop  around  a  bit  more.  In  Sydney  there  are  currently  at  least  three  churches  that  openly  invite  homosexuals,  and  priests  from  all   dominions  who  have  a  nore  liberal  understand-   ing  of  homosexuality.  The  fight  for  ^cognition  within  the  C  h  urch  has  just  toted  and  the  Church  remains  ,!le  last  great  bastl  Q  n  of  homophobia  in  the  Western  World.   Dear  Blessed  Pope,   Thank  you  for  doing  so  much  to  educate  people  regarding  God's  Lav.  I  have  learned  a  great  deal  from  you  and  try  to  share  that  knowledge  with  as  many  people  as  I  can.  When  someone  tries  to  defend  the  homosexual  lifestyle  for  example,  I  simply  remind  them  that  leviticus  18:22  clearly  states  it  to  be  an  abomination.  End  of  debate!  I  do,  however,  need  some  advice  from  you  regardtag  some  of  the  other  specific  laws  and  how  to  follow  them.  When  I  burn  a  bull  on  the  altar  as  a  sacrifice,  I  know  it  creates  a  pleasing  odour  for  the  Lord  (lev.  1:9),  the  problem  is  my  neighbours.  They  claim  the  odour  is  'not  pleasing  to  them.  Should  I  smite  them?  I  would  like  to  sell  my  daughter  into  slavery,  as  sanctioned  in  Sxodus  21:7  ,  in  this  day  and  age,  what  do  you  think  would  be  a  fair  price  for  her?  I  know  that  I  am  allowed  no  contact  with  a  woman  while  she  is  in  her  period  of  menstrual  cleanliness  (Lev.  15:19-  24),  the  problem  is,  how  do  I  tell?  I  have  tried  asking,  bu  most  women  take  offence.  Lev.  25:44  states  that  I  may  indeed  possess  slaves,  both  male  and  female,  provided  they  are  purchased  from  neighbouring  nations.  A  friend  of  mine  claims  that  this  applies  to  Tasmanians  but  not  New  Zealanders,  can  you  clarify?  Why  can't  I  own  New  Zealanders?  I  have  a  neighbour  who  insists  on  working  on  the  Sabbath.  Exodus  36:2  clearly  states  he  should  be  put  to  death,  am  I  morally  obligated  to  kill  him  myself?  A  friend  of  mine  feels  that  even  though  eating  shellfish  is  an  abomination  (Lev.  11:10),  it  is  a  lesser  abomination  than  homosexuality.  I  don't  agree.  Can  you  settle  this?  Lev  21:20  states  that  I  may  not  approach  the  altar  of  God  if  I  have  a  defect  in  my  sight.  I  have  to  admit  that  I  wear  reading  glasses,  does  my  vision  have  to  be  20/20,  or  is  there  some  wiggle  room  here?  Most  of  my  male  friends  get  their  hair  trimmed,  including  the  hair  around  their  temples,  even  though  this  is  expressly  forbidden  by  Lev  19:27.  How  should  they  die?  I  know  from  Lev.  11:6-8  that  touching  a  pig  makes  me  unclean,  but  may  I  still  play  football  if  I  wear  gloves?  My  uncle  has  a  farm,  he  violates  Lev  19:19  by  planting  different  crops  in  the  same  field,  as  does  his  wife  by  wearing  garments  made  of  two  different  kinds  of  thread  (cotton/polyester  blend).  He  also  tends  to  curse  and  blaspheme  a  lot.  Is  it  really  necessary  that  we  go  to  all  the  trouble  of  getting  the  whole  town  together  to  stone  him  to  death  (Lev  24:10-16)?  Couldn't  we  just  burn  them  to  death  at  a  private  family  affair  like  we  do  with  people  who  sleep  with  their  in-laws?  (Lev  20:14)  Awaiting  your  enlightenment,   Fred  N.

"  Newcastle  presents  cheque,  orthopaedic  school  benefits   Money  raised  throughout  the  year  will  go  towards  new  sun  shelter   By  LEUT  MJ  Baxter   The  ship's  company  of  HMAS  Newcastle  (CAPT  Gerry  Christian)  has  been  busy  re-establishing  ties  with  residents  of  their  ship's  namesake  city.  Newcastle  's  company  has  been  involved  in  both  char-   ity  work  and  goodwill  visits  while  the  ship's  refit  period  draws  to  a  close.  On  October  15,  the  ship's  helicopter  flew  to  two  high  schools  in  the  area  in  support  of  the  local  ADF  Recruiting  staff.  The  visits  to  Warners  Bay  High  School  and  Lambton  High  School  proved  a  great  success.  The  students  were   particularly  interested  in  the  crew's  involvement  in  The  Gulf  and  how  the  helicopter  was  employed.  Each  school  was  left  with  the  crew  from  Newcastle  flight  promising  to  return  soon.  On  November  20  CAPT  Christian  and  a  number  of  his  junior  officers  visited  the  ship's  chosen  charity,  Hunter  Orthopaedic  School.  The  CO  took  the  opportuni-  ty  to  present  a  cheque  for  $3600  representing  money  made  through  fund-raising  events  throughout  the  year.  This  money  will  be  going  towards  the  building  of  a  new  sun  shelter  behind  the  school.  HMAS  Newcastle  returns  to  the  region  in  January  next  year  to  support  the  Newcastle  Maritime  Festival.

"  The  oaradox  of  the  Church   Title:  Constantine's  Sword:  the   Church  and  the  Jews,  a   Historv   Author.  James  Carroll   Publishers:  Houghton  Mufflin  Co,  Boston   New  York  2001   Reviewer:  Zelman  Freeman   IN  312CE  the  Roman  Emperor  Constantine   became  a  Christian  for  political  and  reli  gious  reasons.  Soon  after,  Christianity  became  the  state  religion  of  the  Roman  Empire.   James  Carroll’s  book  is  unique  in  that  as  a  devout  American  Christian  who  gained  the  Catholic  priesthood,  he  has  dealt  with  a  his  torical  record  of  the  Church’s  abuse  of  the   Jews  in  an  open  and  fearless  manner,  relying  in  part  upon  Catholic  documentation.   This  subject  has  been  addressed  in  the  past  by  many  Jewish  and  other  scholars.  One  of  the  latter  was  a  Catholic  theologian  in  Munich,  Johann  von  Dollinger,  who  in  1890  drew  the  connection  between  antisemitism  and  the  Christian  pursuit  of  power.   The  author’s  interest  in  the  Catholic  Church’s  persecution  of  Jews  was  given  impetus  by  the  example  of  Pope  John  XXIII  when,  as  the  papal  legate  to  Turkey  in  World  War  II,  he  counterfeited  baptismal  certifi  cates  for  Jews  fleeing  Hitler.   As  Pope  John,  he  convened  Vatican  II  in  an  attempt  to  liberalise  the  Church.  He  removed  the  words  “faithless”  and  “perfidi  ous”  as  applied  to  Jews  in  the  Good  Friday  liturgy,  and  the  Council  absolved  Jews  from  the  blame  of  Christ’s  death.   Carroll  quotes  Hannah  Arend’s  account  of  how  John  XXIII  answered  a  question  about  what  he  should  do  against  Hochhuth’s  indictment  of  Pope  Paul  XII’s  indifference  to  the  Jews  during  the  war  as  portrayed  in  his  play  The  Deputy.  John  replied  “do  against  it?  What  can  you  do  against  the  truth?”   This  work  from  a  personalised  beginning   deals  with  the  New  Testament  origins  of  Jew  hatred;  among  them,  Constantine  and  Saint  Augustine’s  attitude  to  the  Jews.   Carroll  is  fearful  of  a  deteriorating  beam   in  the  foundations  of  the  Church’s  edifice.  In  his  view  one  treatable  element  of  this  corro  sion  is  the  need  to  acknowledge  the  harm  the  Church  has  done  to  the  Jews.   Although  the  author  denies  the  Church’s  responsibility  for  the  Shoah,  others  may  not   be  so  convinced.   This  book  is  a  mine  of  information  about  Church-Jewish  events.   What  have  the  Jews  done  that  generation  after  generation  they  are  treated  the  way  they  have  been?  This  is  a  question  some  times  asked  by  intelligent  people.  This  high  ly  recommended  book  will  help  answer  that  question  in  a  paradoxical  manner.   H  Zelman  Freeman  is  a  retired  physician  and  Sydney-based  reviewer. ",2002-01-25

"  Historic  alliance  in  the  making   As  Australians  observed  a  day  of  mourning,   Christians  across  the  United  States  showed  a  historic  solidarity  with  Israel.   FOR  millions  of  American  Christians,  this  was  no  ordinary  Sunday.  In  an  unprecedented  show  of  support,  nearly  20,000  churches  across  the  United  States  joined  in  a  “Day  of  prayer  and  solidarity”  with  Israel  and  the  Jewish  people.   From  Maine  to  California,  some  five  million  Christians  were  expected  to  take  part  in  special  services,  where  they  would  raise  their  voices  in  prayer  on  behalf  of  the  State  of  Israel,  listen  to  inspirational  ser  mons,  and  express  their  love  and  admiration  for  the  people  of  Israel.   This  remarkable  event  is  the  brainchild  of  Rabbi  Yechiel  Eckstein,  chairman  of  the  International  Federation  of  Christians  and  Jews,  and  Ralph  Reed,  former  head  of  the  Christian  Coalition,  who  earlier  this  year  joined  forces  to  create  Stand  for  Israel  (www.standforisrael.org)  as  a  means  of  mobilising  grassroots  Christian  support  for  the  Jewish   State.   In  promotional  material  that  was  distributed  to  churches  throughout  America  prior  to  the  event,  the  group  said,  “This  crisis  is  one  of  the  worst  Israel  has  ever  faced,  and  its  future  as  a  nation  hangs  in  the  bal  ance.  As  Christians  we  have  an  obli   gation  and  a  calling  to  pray  for   Jerusalem  and  stand  with  the  Jewish  people  in  defending  their  historic   homeland.”   The  response,  it  appears,  has  been  overwhelming.  As  Eckstein  noted,  the  large  number  of  churches  that  agreed  to  participate  “reflects  the  bonds  that  have  been  forged  between  Christians  in  America  and  Israel,  especially  since  September  11.  There  is  a  greater  recognition  that  we  must  stand  united  as  we  face  a  common  battle  against  internation  al  terrorism.”   The  fact  that  large  numbers  of  Christians  gathered  to  pray  for  the  safety  and  wellbeing  of  Israel  is  all  the  more  extraordinary  when  one  considers  the  painful  record  of  Christianity’s  treatment  of  the  Jews  over  the  centuries.  Forced  conver   sions,  pogroms,  the  Crusades,  and  the  Inquisition  are  but  some  of  the  horrors  which  Christians  inflicted  on  Jews  in  Europe  and  elsewhere.  As  the  late  Joshua  Trachtenberg  noted   in  his  seminal  study  The  Devil  and  the  Jews,  Christians  systematically  demonised  Jews  throughout  the  Middle  Ages,  accusing  them  of  poi  soning  Christian  wells,  ritually  mur  dering  Christian  children,  and  using  sorcery  and  magic  in  alliance  with  the  devil.  Indeed,  as  some  historians  have  argued,  it  was  this  thorough  and  methodical  delegitimisation  that  laid  the  intellectual  groundwork  for  the  persecution  of  the  Jews  in  the   modem  era  as  well.   It  should  come  as  no  surprise,  then,  that  many  Jews  remain  wary  of  Christian  support  for  Israel.  Centuries  of  harassment  and  dis  crimination  are  not  easily  shaken,  after  all.  And  compounding  the  prob  lem  is  the  expressed  desire  of  some  pro-Israel  Christian  groups  to  prose  lytise  among  Jews  in  an  effort  to  con  vert  them,  which  naturally  casts  a  shadow  of  suspicion  over  other  Christian  organisations  too.  Last  week,  it  was  reported  that  the  Chief  Rabbinical  Council  has  decided  to  look  into  the  question  of  religious  Israeli  institutions  accepting  money  from  Christian  groups  abroad  in  light  of  the  possible  links  some  may  have  to  missionary  activities.   “American  Christians  are   playing  an  increasingly   important  role  as  backers  and  supporters  of  Israel.""   While  thwarting  attempts  at  mis  sionary  activity  is  vital,  it  would  nev  ertheless  be  wrong  to  condemn  all  Christians  as  surreptitious  soul   snatchers.   Undoubtedly,  some  pro-Israel  Christians  are  motivated  by  the  belief  that  reaching  out  with  political  support  is  an  easy  way  to  gain  entry  to  a  Jew’s  heart  and  thereby  capture  his  soul.  But  the  vast  majority  of  American  Christians  prayed  for  Israel  for  far  less  sinister,  and  emi  nently  more  noble,  reasons.  They  did  so  out  of  a  sincere  and  abiding  commitment  to  the  welfare  of  the  country  and  its  people,  and  out  of  a  deep  sense  of  gratitude  to  the  Jews   2500  Christians  recently  participated  In  the  Jerusalem  March  to  demonstrate   solidarity  with  Israel.  Photo:  isranet   for  their  contributions  to  western  civilisation,  such  as  monotheism  and  morality.   Thus,  to  paint  all  pro-lsrael  Christians  with  the  brush  of  “mis  sionary”  seems  neither  fair  nor  accu  rate,  and  one  would  hope  that  more  Jews  will  begin  to  realise  this.  Similarly,  Christian  groups  need  to  be  made  more  aware  of  the  Jewish  people’s  justified  opposition  to  serv  ing  as  targets  of  proselytisation,  which  by  its  very  nature  is  both  patronising  and  offensive.   As  recent  months  have  shown,  American  Christians  are  playing  an  increasingly  important  role  as  back  ers  and  supporters  of  Israel.  More  and  more,  they  are  making  their  voices  heard  in  the  halls  of  power,  thanks  to  the  efforts  of  groups  such  as  Stand  For  Israel  and  Esther  Levens’s  National  Unity  Coalition  for  Israel.  Christian  America  is  reaching  out  to  Israel  and  the  Jews,  and  it  would  be  wrong  to  reject  the  gesture  out  of  hand.  A  historic  alliance  is  in  the  making,  one  which  could  go  a  long  way  toward  healing  the  wounds  of  the  past  and  forging  a  united  front  of  Jews  and  Christians  in  the  strug  gle  for  a  safe  and  secure  Middle  East.  And  to  that,  one  can  only  say,  amen.   H  This  was  published  as  an  editorial   in  the  Jerusalem  Post ",2002-10-25

"  Church:  Jews  also  wait  for  Messiah   RulhE@ruber   BUDAPEST  —  Jews  involved  in  interfaith  dialogue  are  praising  a  new  Vatican  document  that  appears  to  represent  a  turning  point  in  the  way   Roman  Catholic  doctrine  views  the  Hebrew  Bible.   One  of  the  key  points  of  The  Jewish  People  and  the  Holy  Scriptures  in  the  Christian  Bible  is  that  the  Church  believes  the  Old  Testament  retains  its  moral  value,  not  just  its  lit  erary  appeal,  Rabbi  Arthur  Schneier  said  by  telephone  from  New  York.   Schneier  is  the  president  of  the  Appeal  of  Conscience  Foundation,  a  group  that  promotes  religious   freedom.   Released  quietly  two  months  ago,  the  document  also  explicitly  states  that  “the  Jewish  wait  for  the  Messiah  is  not  in  vain”.   Jews  and  Christians  share  the  wait  for  the  Messiah,  it  says,  but  Jews  are  waiting  for  the  first  coming,  and   Christians  for  the  second.   “The  difference  consists  in  the  fact  that  for  us,  he  who  will  come  will  have  the  same  traits  of  that  Jesus   who  has  already  come,”  wrote  the  Vatican’s  chief  theologian,  Cardinal  Joseph  Ratzinger,  who  signed  the   document.   The  document  also  expresses  regret  that  certain  passages  in  the  Christian  Bible  condemning  individual  Jews  have  been  used  to   justify  antisemitism.  Nowhere  in  the  Christian  Bible,  it  said,  can  one  find  passages  reflecting  “an  attitude  of  scorn,  hostility  or  persecution  of   Jews  as  Jews”.   Jews  involved  in  interfaith   dialogue  welcomed  the  document.  “It  seems  to  be  another  significant,  positive  step  in  the  process  of  increasing  Catholic  appreciation  of  Jews  and  Judaism,”  said  Stanislaw  Krajewski,  the  Warsaw  consultant  of  the  American  Jewish  Committee  and  a  longtime  activist  in  Catholic-Jewish  dialogue.   The  fact  that  Ratzinger,  who  is  regarded  as  a  conservative,  signed  the  document  also  is  seen  as  significant.   It  seems  to  be  another   significant,  positive  step  in  the  process  of  increasing   Catholic  appreciation  of  Jews   and  Judaism""   Stanislaw  Krajewski,  American  Jewish  Committee   A  document  he  released  last  year  called  Dominus  lesus  appeared  to  challenge  the  idea  that  “one  religion  is  as  good  as  another”.   Vatican  chief  spokesman  Joaquin  Navarro  Vails  said  the  new  document  now  is  part  of  official  church  doctrine.   The  Catholic  News  Agency  wrote,  “Commission  members  said  their  document  was  meant  to  contribute  to   Jewish-Christian  understanding  by  explaining  the  importance  of  the  Jewish  Scriptures  for  Christian  faith  and  providing  a  context  for  Christians  reading  references  to  Jews  in  the  New  Testament”.   The  document  has  been  making  news  not  just  for  its  message,  but  because  it  was  published  with  almost  no  fanfare.   The  document  appeared  in  some  Rome  bookshops  two  months  ago  as  a  210-page  volume.  But  it  was  released  in  French  and  Italian  only,  and  was  not  publicised.   The  Vatican  usually  announces  major  documents  and  presents  them  officially  at  press  conferences.  A   Polish  translation  was  released  last  week  to  coincide  with  the  “Day  of  Judaism”  marked  annually  by  the  Roman  Catholic  church  in  Poland  on  January  17,  but  no  full  English  text  has  yet  been  released.   Krajewski  said  the  Polish  transla  tion  of  the  document  was  carried  out  by  the  Rev.  Ryszard  Rubinkiewicz,  a  professor  in  Lublin,  who  also  was  a  member  of  the  commission  that  researched  and  wrote  it.   “I  am  sure  that  the  influence  of  that  trip  was  very  positive,”  Krajewski  said.  “He  told  me  how  impressed  he  was.”   Other  Jewish  commentators  also  praised  the  Vatican  document,  but  some  called  it  less  of  a  breakthrough.   The  document  is  a  positive  statement,  but  not  a  marked  departure  from  Church  views  in  recent  years,  according  to  Rabbi  Charles  Arian,  the  Jewish  staff  scholar  at  the  Institute  for  Christian  and  Jewish  Studies.   The  legitimacy  of  the  Jewish  reli  gion  has  been  implicit  in  church  doc  trine,  but  this  document  makes  it  more  explicit,  Arian  said.   But  the  document  does  come  close  to  a  full  rejection  of  the  concept  that  Christianity  replaced  Judaism,  said  Eugene  Korn,  director  of  Interfaith  Affairs  for  the   Anti-Defamation  League.

"  More  magic  from  Makor   Title:   My  Mother’s  Child   Author  Helen  Gardner   Publisher:  Makor,  208  pages,   2001  $27.50   Reviewer:  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Cohen   MAKOR  is  the  Jewish   Communal  Library  in  Melbourne  which  has  cre  ated  an  interesting  series  known  as  “Write  your  Story”,  which  has  enabled  many  to  put  on  paper  their  story.  To  be  honest,  I  resisted  reading  this  book  and  in  retrospect  I  was  wrong  for  this  is  a  book  which  should  be  read  for  its  insights  are  important,  especially  for  those  of  us  brought  up  in  the  Anglo-Jewish  tradition.   Helen  Gardner  was  born  just  prior  to  World  War  II  in  Melbourne  and  spent  her  early  years  raised  in  a  non-Jewish  milieu  which  shaped  her  in  ways  which  she  only  would   come  to  understand  much  later  in  life.  She  had  in  early  life  two  fami  lies,  a  Baptist  family  who  shaped  her  early  life  and  later  her  return  to  Judaism.  As  a  young  child,  even  though  she  had  returned  to  the  family  of  her  birth  which  was  Jewish,  she  would  have  preferred  to  have  remained  in  her  Baptist  world.  As  she  reflects,  “I  also  began  to  understand  that  although  I  had  thought  that  I  had  given  up  being  Christian  and  become  Jewish,  I  had  actually  done  neither,  and  that  my  Christian  background  sabotaged  my  Judaism  with  subtle  beliefs  and  values  whose  genesis  I  often  didn’t  recognise.”   Dr  Garner  tells  of  the  tension  in  the  Passover  Haggadah  which  recounts  the  story  of  the  five  rab  bis  who  were  in  reality,  Pharisees.  Against  that  is  the  way  that  the  Christian  world  sees  the  word  “Pharisee”  in  such  negative  terms.  Having  heard  the  phrase  in  her   early  life  used  so  negatively,  she  had  to  readjust  her  concepts  when  discovering  that  these  Pharisees  were  the  very  saviours  of  Judaism.   Her  family  of  origin  was  not  easy.  Her  brother  was  significantly  older   and  her  father  died  when  she  was   young.  Her  mother  was  rarely  sup  portive  in  Helen’s  growing  up,  and  I  suspect  many  others  would  res  onate  with  her  journey.  Many  would  criticise  Helen  for  “airing  dirty  washing  in  public”,  but  her  retelling  her  journey  does  not  strike  me  as  such.  Those  who  have   a  working  knowledge  of  family  sys  tem’s  theory  would  be  fascinated  by  her  story.  There  is  a  strong  sense  of  healing  in  reading  this   book.   “Although  I  had  given  up   being  Christian  and  become  Jewish,  I  had  actually  done   neither,  and  that  my  Christian  background   sabotaged  my  Judaism  with   subtle  beliefs  and  values.”   Author  Helen  Gardner   She  is  honest  as  she  reflects  how   that  struggle  impacted  on  her  chil  dren,  their  identity  and  their  affilia  tion  with  the  Jewish  people.   Makor  must  be  complimented  for  creating  this  series  and  Dr  Helen  Gardner  thanked  for  being  prepared  to  offer  so  much  of  her  self  in  this  book.  This  is  a  book  which  should  be  read  and  reflected  upon.   ■  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Cohen  is  AJN’s  literary  editor. ",2002-01-18
"  Tribute  service  for  Queen  Mum   Plans  for  a  special  memorial  service  giving  thanks  for  the  life  and  witness  of  the  Queen  Mother  will  be  held  at  Echuca  Anglican  Church  today  at  2pm.  Echuca  Anglican  rector,  Canon  Graeme  MacRobb  said  the  community  was  welcome  to  pay  tribute  to  the  Queen  Mother.  ""It  is  fitting  that  our  community  pays  tribute  to  this  grand  lady  who  played  a  significant  role  in  not  only   Great  Britain  during  the  past  century  but  also  in  Australia,""  he  said.  ""She  was  a  faithful  Christian  and  an  active  member  of  her  own  Christian  tradition,  the  Anglican  Church.  ""She  had  a  passionate  faith  in  God  and  publicly  acknowledged  her  belief  that  it  was  their  Christian  commitment  that  led  her  husband  George  VI  and  herself  to  step   forward  to  serve  their  country  and  the  British  Commonwealth  at  one  of  the  most  difficult  times  in  British  and  Commonwealth  history.""  Canon  MacRobb  said  she  was  an  example  of  moral  and  spiritual  leadership  and  great  community  service.  '  'It  is  easy  for  recent  generations  to  think  of  her  as  simply  a  pampered  member  of  royalty  as   parts  of  the  Australian  press  maliciously  inferred  in  recent  days,""  he  said.  ""Those  making  such  tasteless  comments  seem  totally  ignorant  of  the  fact  that  she  and  her  husband  George  were  unwillingly  thrust  into  a  public  role  and  a  lifetime  of  community  service  at  the  very  moment  when  the  British  people  and  indeed  the  whole  British  Commonwealth  most  sorely  needed  moral  and  spiritual  leadership.""

"  THE  postponement  of  an  interfaith  Holocaust  remembrance  service  in  Sydney  because  of   violence  in  the  Middle  East  has  been   condemned  as  “disturbing”  and  “offensive”  by  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies.   The  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  put  the  annual  service  at  St  Mary’s  Cathedral  on  hold  one  day  before  it  was  scheduled.  A  decision  is  yet  to  be  made  when  it  will  take  place.   The  Council  considered  it  “unwise”  to  hold  the  service  at  this  time,  president  Mayor  Graham  Harris  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.  “It  is  a  tragedy  that  the  place  where  Christians  believe  the  Prince  of  Peace,  Jesus  Christ,  was  born,  has  become  a  place  of  war,  bloodshed  and  fighting.”   However,  the  Catholic  Church  is  supportive  of  Holocaust  Awareness  and   continues  to  be  “a  warm  and  willing  host”  of  the  service,  Board  of  Deputies  Holocaust  Remembrance  Committee  chairman  David  Knoll  said.   “During  recent  years,  many  Christians  have  come  to  appreciate  the  significance  of  this  annual  joint  service  commemorating  the  victims  of  Nazi  genocide.   “At  a  time  when  the  Christian  world  has  attempted  to  achieve  reconciliation  with  the  Jewish  people  over  antisemitism  which  reached  a  peak  in  the  Holocaust,  there  is  a  need  for  events  such  as  the  service  during  Holocaust  Awareness  Week  to  enable  Christian  regret  to  be  expressed.”   Israeli  Consul-General  Ephraim  Ben  Matityahu,  who  was  to  have  addressed  the  service,  said:  “Anything  that  takes  place  in  the  Middle  East  shouldn’t  impact  on  reconciliation  or  understanding  between  the  Jewish  world,  Israel  and  the  Christian  world.” ",2002-04-12
"  From  the  Editor   PETER  Olszewski  has  a  story  to  tell.  He  isn’t  Jewish,  yet  he  is  a  target  of  antisemitic  abuse.  He  happens  to  be  blessed/burdened  with  a  Jewish-sounding  surname  and  a   hawk-like  nose.   A  Communications  lecturer  at  the   University  of  the  Sunshine  Coast,  he  relates  his  experiences  with  feeling  and  wry  humour  in  a  column  titled  “Demonised,  even  though  I’m  not  Jewish”  (page  19).   Complementing  each  other  on  our  Opinion  pages  are  two  thought-provoking  articles  —  “What  I  envy  about  the  Christian  faith”  and  “Why  I  am  jealous  of  the  Dalai   Lama”.   The  first  is  by  Rabbi  John  Levi,  who  offers  a  sober  analysis  —  also  tinged  with  humour  —of  the  differences  between  the  Jewish  and  Christian  faiths,  ranging  from  the  Christian  ability  to  respect  three-minute  deadlines  on  speeches  to  the  fact  that  a  church  can  stand  open  to  the  world  for  ten  years  and  remain  undamaged  and  unthreatened.   On  a  different  tack,  Rabbi  Laibl  Wolf,  known  for  his  mind-yoga  workshops,  exam  ines  why  members  of  the  Jewish  faith  and   tradition  seek  and  find  fulfillment  in  other  faiths  and  traditions.   He  doesn’t  direct  the  blame  at  individuals,  but  at  the  institutions  and  teachers  of  Judaism,  questioning  how  relevant  and  meaningfully  spiritual  they  make  it  The  arti  cles  are  on  pages  18  and  19.   “Teens  once  used  marijuana;  now  it’s  cocaine  and  ecstasy”  is  the  next  in  our  series  on  drug  abuse.   Simone  Abel  has  canvassed  several  exp  erts,  all  of  whom  agree  that  a  zero-tolerance  approach  is  counterproductive  (page  IT).   Next  week,  we  will  publish  a  frank  account  by  a  former  dayschool  student  who  experi   mented  with  LSD.   Finally,  the  IPO  is  coming.  As  we  report  on  page  3,  a  band  of  aficionados  has  been  at  work  in  the  back  rooms,  raising  the  consid  erable  amount  needed  to  bring  the  Israel  Philharmonic  Orchestra  to  Australia.   Those  who  are  fortunate  enough  to  hear  their  music  will  be  the  richer  for  the  experi   ence.   Vic  Alhadeff ",2002-06-14
"  Not  a  priest   HE  marched  in  a  pro-Palestinian  demonstration  through  Sydney  the  other  week.  He  bore  a  placard:  “They  killed  the  Prince  of  Peace,  so  what  do  you  expect  from  them?   He  wore  a  clerical  collar.  He   appeared  to  be  a  priest  calling  on  Christians  to  rise  against  the  Jews.   I  suspect  he  was  not  a  real  priest,  but  a  dressed-up  actor.  A  real  priest,  whatever  his  view  of  the  Middle  East,  would  not  peddle  such  anti  Christian  sloganism.   “Anti-Christian”?  Surely  the  name  for  this  is  antisemitism!   It  ignores  the  fact  that  after  cen  turies  of  Jewish  suffering,  Church  statements  unambiguously  repudi  ated  the  accusation  of  deicide.   It  takes  no  account  of  the  fact  that  Christian  scholarship  rejects  the  claim  that  it  was  Jews  who  killed  Jesus.  (One  might  add  that  whoever  did  kill  Jesus,  Christianity  believes  his  death  removed  sin  from  the  world,  so  what  would  have  hap  pened  to  sin  without  his  death?)   No  real  priest  would  shoot  him  self  in  the  foot  by  denigrating  the   Jews.   To  be  fair,  he  would  have  to  deny  himself  the  benefit  of  all  the  ongoing  Jewish  contributions  to  civilisation.   He  would  have  to  rewrite  history,  leaving  out  Einstein’s  theory  of  rela  tivity,  as  well  as  treatments  for  syphilis,  diabetes,  convulsions,  mal  nutrition,  infantile  paralysis  and  tuberculosis,  discovered  by  Jews.   He  would  have  to  live  without  the  movements  in  art,  music,  litera  ture,  philosophy,  science,  medicine,  law,  media,  education  democracy  and  commerce  developed  by  Jews.   He  would  have  to  manage  with  out  the  Scriptures  and  Ten  Com  mandments;  without  monotheism,  love  of  God,  love  of  the  stranger;  without  the  dignity  of  all  human  beings;  the  concept  of  the  Messiah.   And  to  go  in  for  really  serious  denigration  of  Jews,  he’d  have  to  give  back  the  Jew  Jesus  too  —  and  Christianity  itself.  Whoever  he  is,  he  can’t  be  a  real  priest,  and  what  he  says  can’t  be  Christianity.   Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  Great  Synagogue ",2002-05-24
"  Digging  down  to  the  roots   Whose  Promised  land?   The  Continuing  Crisis  Over  flsraei  and  Palestine   Colin  Chapman   Lion  Publishing,  2002,  352  pages  (revised  edition),  $29.95   Reviewed  by  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Cohen   I  APPROACHED  this  book  with  some  trepidation  as  the  author  has  been  a  lecturer  in  Islamic  studies  at  the  Near  East  School  of  Theology  in  Beirut  sine  1999.   It  deals  with  the  decades-old  Israeli  Palestinian  conflict.  Written   by  someone  who  has  spent  signifi  cant  amounts  of  time  in  the  Middle  East  and  first  published  after  the  1982  Israeli  invasion  of  south  Lebanon,  it  is  even  more  relevant  today.   The  conflict  between  Israel  and  the  Palestinians  has  profoundly  affected  the  whole  of  the  Middle  East  for  more  than  50  years  and  no  doubt  contributed  to  the  anger  and  resent  ment  which  led  to  the  terrorist  out   rages  of  September  11,2001.  Can  this  conflict  ever  be  resolved?   The  book  provides  a  brief  yet  comprehensive  historical  back  ground  to  the  people  who  have   inhabited  the  land  of  Palestine  over  the  centuries.  Zionism,  its  roots,  ideals  and  implementation  are  analysed  as  are  the  Arab  and  Israeli  claims  to  the  land  of  Palestine.  The  Bible  and  those  parts  which  pertain  to  the  Zionist  claims  are  also  exam  ined.   This  text  digs  beneath  the  Israel  and  Palestine  conflict  to  examine  the  roots  of  the  two  cultures.  Chapman   explores  the  history  of  the  two  peo  ples  and  of  Jewish  settlement  in  the  region.  He  acknowledges  the  reli  gious  roots  of  the  feelings  on  both  sides  and  looks  to  the  Bible  to  han  dle  modem  events.   This  edition  is  substantially  revised  and  includes  new  chapters  on  the  crisis  of  Zionism,  the  role  of  the  USA,  and  Zionism  and  Islam.  It  also  explores  the  theme  of  land  in  the  Bible  (both  Jewish  and  Christian),  highlighting  legitimate  and  illegitimate  ways  of  using  the  Bible  in  relation  to  the  conflict.   There  is  a  short  section  analysing  the  relationship  between  Zionism  and  Islam.  Chapman  then  follows  with  a  segment  on  possible  solutions   between  Israel  and  the  Palestinians.   One  of  my  teachers,  Lionel  Blue,   argues  that  the  solution  to  the  Israeli  Palestinian  problem  must  be  a  reli  gious  one  rather  than  a  political  one.  Given  the  events  of  the  past  decade,  perhaps  he  is  correct.  Chapman  touches  on  this  theory,  but  fails  to  develop  it  beyond  a  passing  men   tion.   “He  acknowledges  the   religious  roots  of  the  feelings   on  both  sides  and  looks  to  the  Bible  to  handle  modern   events.”   The  second  part  of  the  book  pres  ents  some  of  the  more  recent  think   ing  from  various  perspectives.  Much  -*  has  been  written  over  the  past  few  years  about  Christian  fundamental  ist  support  for  Israel.  Most  readers  will  know  this  intellectually,  but  few  of  us  understand  its  basis  within  Christian  theology.  On  the  other  hand,  many  of  the  more  liberal  churches  choose  to  criticise  Israel  using  the  same  texts.  Unfortunately  Chapman  does  not  resolve  this  issue   for  outsiders.   The  book  challenges  many  assumptions,  including  those  of   Christian  Zionists,  before  presenting  *  Chapman’s  own  personal  answers  to   the  crisis.  It  leaves  the  reader  to  decide  to  whom  Palestine  is  the  promised  land.   H  Jeffrey  Cohen  is  the  AJN’s  literary   editor. ",2002-08-09

"  Lack  of  Jewish  support  for  interfaith  body  deplored   LACK  of  support  from  the  Jewish  communi  ty  for  the  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  has  been  deplored  by  the  president  of  the  interfaith  organisation.   While  “we  have  extremely  staunch  repre  sentation  from  some  sections  of  the  Jewish  community,  it  is  not  in  proportion  to  that  which  comes  from  the  Christian  side  of  the  table”,  Salvation  Army  Major  Graham  Harris  told  the  Council’s  annual  general  meeting.   “The  Council’s  charter  to  educate  Christians  and  Jews  to  appreciate  each  oth  ers’  distinctive  beliefs  specifically  directs  us  to  achieve  this  through  awareness  of  their  common  ground  and  to  respect  their  indi  viduality,”  Major  Harris  continued.   “We  can  only  accomplish  this  by  encour  aging  dialogue  between  the  faiths  to  engen  der  understanding  and  eradicate  much  of  the  mis-teaching  of  history  in  past  eras.”   A  member  of  the  Salvation  Army’s  educa  tional  arm,  Major  Harris  said  the  Council  needs  greater  recognition  from  members  of  the  Jewish  community  of  the  importance  of  its  objective  of  stamping  out  antisemitism.   “I  appeal  to  our  Jewish  friends  to  recog  nise  this  imperative  and  the  significance  of  dialogue.   “1  appeal  to  them  to  open  their  hearts  and  recognise  that  their  Christian  neighbours  are  no  longer  their  Christian  enemies  and  to  join  them  to  benefit  from  their  commonalities,  as  indeed  we  benefit  from  our  individualities.”   Major  Harris  voiced  appreciation  to  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  for  distribut  ing  the  Council’s  newsletter  to  members.   Any  member  of  the  Jewish  community   NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  president  Major  Graham  Harris.   who  would  like  to  receive  the  publication  free  of  charge  should  contact  Council  secre  tary  Sister  Marianne  Dacy  at  9351  4162  or  email  mdacy@library.usyd.edu.au,  he  added.   “The  next  step  will  be  for  members  of  the  Board  who  agree  with  the  aims  and  charter  of  the  Council  to  act  as  multipliers  —  to  make  the  members  of  the  organisations  they  represent  aware  of  the  Council  and  to  encourage  them  to  participate  in  its  activi   ties  and  its  debates.   “Their  participation  at  our  functions  or  as  nominees  for  the  Council’s  executive  will  be  warmly  welcome.” ",2002-09-13
"  Sheer  terror  of  attack   Pakistan  shooting   By  Liz  Walsh   Twas  in  the  dining  room...(when)  we  a  heard  what  seemed  like  shots.  We  went  outside  to  check  and  then  saw  the  terrorists  coming  up  from  the  tennis  court  area.  I  crawled  along  the  floor  to  the  other  end  of  the  dining  room.  I  was  the  only  one  there.  There  were  four  big  rolls  of  carpet  laying  on  the  floor,  so  I  rolled  myself  up  in  one  -  and  prayed.  I  wondered  if  I  would  ever  see  Ann  again  and  how  many  mutilated,  damaged  bodies  of  kids  we  would  have  to  treat  -  and  whether  I  would  hear  footsteps  down  the  hallway.  THIS  is  part  of  an  email  Kimba  Anglican  missionary  Barry  Lock  sent  to  friends  and  family  on  Eyre  Peninsula  on  Tuesday  following  Monday's  terrorist  attack  on  Murree  Christian  School  in  Pakistan  where  he  was  working  as  the  school  boarding  manager.  Mr  Lock  and  his  wife  Ann  were   unharmed  in  the  attack,  but  four  Pakistanis  died  including  three  fellow  school  employees.  Ann  was  teaching  one  of  her  learning  disabled  students  in  another  part  of  the  school  and  had  to  take  cover  in  the  room.  Mr  Lock  managed  to  lock  a  door  which  prevented  the  attackers  from  entering  the  hostel.  He  has  been  hailed  a  hero  for  his  quick  actions  which  helped  save  the  lives  of  the  students.  In  his  email  he  described  the  attack  as  ""terrifying"".  The  attackers  worked  calmly  without  rushing  around  as  they  moved  up  through  the  campus  and  handling  their  guns  professionally,""  Mr  Lock  wrote.  ""Our  bedroom  had  about  four  shots  fired  through  the  window.  ""They  moved  to  the  back  of  the  school  and  climbed  over  the  lowest  part  of  the  fence.  ""Unfortunately,  this  is  where  they  saw  a  couple  of  our  Pakistani  staff  hiding  in  the  trees  and  shot  them.""  Continued  Page  4   ££  I  wondered  if  I  would  ever  see  Ann  again  and  how  many  mutilated,  damaged  bodies  of  kids  we  would  have  to  treat  -  and  whether  I  would  hear  footsteps  down  the  ^  hallway.  //   Terror  of  attack   ((  It  is  a  miracle  that  it  wasn't  a  killing  field,  but  tragic  with  the  loss  of  our  Pakistani  friends  and  employees  ??   From  Page  1  Mr  Lock  said  he  had  feared  for  his  life  after  the  attack  began.  He  said  after  the  shooting  had  stopped,  he  emerged  from  hiding  to  check  for  injuries.  ""It  is  a  miracle  that  it  wasn't  a  killing  field,  but  tragic  with  the  loss  of  our  Pakistani  friends  and  employees,""  he  said.  ""We  are  amazed  at  God's  protection.  ""If  it  had  been  10  minutes  earlier  there  would  have  been  students  and  staff  outside  -  moving  back  to  classrooms.""  A  spokesperson  for  the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade  said  four  unknown  and  masked  terrorists  opened  fire  with  automatic  rifles  at  the  school  on  Monday  afternoon  South  Australian  time.  ""Sixteen  Australian  staff  and  students  were  present  at  the  time,""  the  spokesperson  said.  ""No  Australians  were  injured,  but  four  Pakistanis  were  unfortunately  killed  and  up  to  four  others  were  injured.  ""So  far,  no  one  has  claimed  responsibility.""  Christian  Missionaries  Services  (CMS)  Australia  federal  secretary  John  Thew  said  the  attack  occurred  shortly  after  the  morning  break.  He  said  masked  and  armed  men  shot  dead  a  guard  on  the  main  gate  and  a  bystander,  forced  their  way  into  the  main  school  campus  and  over  the  next  10  to  15  minutes  fired  indiscriminately,  before  making  their  escape  over  the  fence  at  the  rear  of  the  property.  Kimba  resident  and  close  family  friend  of  the  Locks,  Relda  Beinke  said  the  couple  was  in  the  hearts  and  minds  of  everyone  in  Kimba.  ""This  is  a  very  serious  situation  they  are  in  and  Kimba  people  are  very  concerned  for  them,""  Mrs  Beinke  said.  She  said  a  meeting  was  being  held  yesterday  to  determine  whether  the  Locks  would  leave  Pakistan.  But  this  is  not  the  first  time  the  Kimba  missionaries  have  had  to  face  the  decision  of  whether  or  not  to  return  to  Australia,  she  said.  ""Last  year  they  had  to  get  out  (following  the  War  on  Terrorism),""  she  said.  ""They  came  back  to  Australia  and  went  back  to  Pakistan  again  a  few  months  later.""  Mrs  Beinke  said  she  had  regular  contact  with  the  59-year  old  Mr  Lock.  ""Barry  and  Ann  love  it  (in  Pakistan),""  she  said.  ""They  are  very  happy  over  there.""  Mrs  Beinke  said  the  couple  left  Kimba  for  Pakistan  in  1989  and  Mr  Lock's  brother  Grant,  also  left  Kimba  to  become  a  missionary  and  an  English  teacher  in  Islamabad,  Pakistan  in  1984.  Anglican  Bishop  Garry  Weatherill  said  Barry  and  Ann  had  been  missionaries  for  about  15  years.  ""They  are  people  of  real  faith  and  courage,""  he  said.  Bishop  Weatherill  said  the  fate  of  the  Christian  School  in  Pakistan  would  be  decided   soon,  but  even  if  the  decision  was  made  to  close  down  the  facility,  the  Locks  would  find  other  ways  of  being  missionaries  in  Pakistan.  ""That  is  the  sort  of  people  they  are,""  he  said.  The  congregation  of  the  Kimba  Anglican  Church  comprised  of  only  about  eight  or  10  regulars,  but  many  other  people  in  the  congregation  had  also  become  missionaries  overseas'  in  places  like  Egypt,  Bishop  Weatherill  said.  CMS  federal  secretary  John  Thew  said  he  knew  Mr  Lock  quite  well,  along  with  the  other  staff  at  the  Murree  Christian  School  and  three  of  his  children  had  attended  the  school.  Mr  Thew  said  he  had  heard  four  or  five  accounts  of  what  took  place  on  Monday  and  said  it  was  clear  that  a  series  of  miracles  had  saved  the  staff  and  students.  He  said  that  since  the  September  11  terrorist  attacks  on  the  United  States,  the  school  had  put  in  place  a  number  of  protocols  to  ensure  the  safety  of  Australians  in  the  event  of  a  terrorist  attack.  ""Pakistan  is  inherently  unstable,  and  since  911  (September  11,  2001),  it  has  been  more  unstable  with  incidents  happening  all  over  the  place,""  he  said.  Mr  Thew  said  one  of  the  protocols  had  been  a  'lock-down  procedure',  which  taught  the  staff  and  students  to  lock  all  the  doors  behind  them  in  the  event  of  an  attack.  This  was  the  procedure  implemented  by  Mr  Lock,  which  ultimately  saved  the  lives  of  him  and  the  several  staff  and  children  in  the  building.  ""There  were  five  or  six  incidents  on  the  morning  of  where  the  'lock-down  procedure'  worked,  along  with  the  kindness  of  God,""  Mr  Thew  said.  The  staff  and  students  at  Murree  Christian  School  are  currently  receiving  counselling  for  the  trauma  that  they  suffered  as  a  result  of  the   attack,  he  said.  ""You  don't  whistle  through  that  sort  of  thing,""  he  said.   UNDER  ATTACK:  Former  Kimba  farmers  Barry  and  Ann  Lock  have  been  Christian  missionaries  to  Pakistan  for  about  15  years.  Mr  Lock  was  caught  up  in  Monday's  terrorist  attack  on  the  Murree  Christian  School,  where  he  is  the  school-boarding  manager. ",2002-08-08

"  Moulin  Rouge  +   DVD  release   Part  three  in  Baz  Luhrmann's  red  curtain  trilogy  (Strictly  Ballroom,  Romeo  and  Juliet)  comes  the  theatrical,  musical  spectacular,  Moulin  Rouge.  Four  years  in  the  making,  Moulin  Rouge  was  filmed  in  Australia  with  an  Australian  crew  and  numerous  Australian  cast  members  including  actors  Nicole  Kidman,  Richard  Roxburgh,  David  Wenham  (Seachange)  performers  Caroline  O'Connor  and  Lara  Muicany  (Mamma-Mia)  and  Australian  singers  Kylie  Minogue,  Natalie  Mendoza  and  Christine  Anu.   Moulin  Rouge  tells  the  story  of  Christian  (Ewan  McGregor),  a  pennyless  play  writer  in  Paris  at  the  turn  of  the  century.  Amidst  the  Bohemian  revolution  Christian  falls  in  love  with  Satine  (Nicole  Kidman),  a  beautiful  courtesan  at  the  Moulin  Rouge  and  so  begins  their  illfated  romance.  Embarking  on  their  journey  in  a  world  of  corruption,  grandeur,  deceit,  and  fantasy  with  the  Bohemian  beliefs  of  Truth,  Beauty,  Freedom,  and  Love,  this  all  singing,  dancing,  comedic  yet  tragic  spectacular  is  a  feast  for  the  eyes.  The  DVD  is  fantastic,  it  features  a  bonus  disk  with  over  three  hours  of  special  features:  Interviews  with  the  cast,  Nicole  Kidman  (Satine),  Ewan  McGregor  (Christian),  Richard  Roxburgh  (The  Duke),  John  Leguizamo  (Toulouse   Lautrec)  and  Jim  Broadbent  as  the  eccentric  Harold  Zidler.  Also  included  are  a  variety  of  dance  sequences,  outtakes,  documentary  footage  on  the  history,  screenwriting,  production  and  the  making  of  Moulin  Rouge,  rare  footage  of  early  dancing  and  singing  rehearsals,  interviews  with  crew  members  about  lighting,  visual  effects,  construction  and  much  more.  There  is  on  going  commentary  by  the  ever  fabulous  director  Baz  Luhrmann  and  discussion  on  his  four  year  expedition.  Academy  Award  winning  designer  Catherine  Martin  takes  us  behind  the  scenes  with  the  designing  of  sets  and  the  thousands  of  costumes  that  make  the  Moulin  Rouge  come  alive.  What  really  makes  Moulin  Rouge  shine  is  the  music.   Who  ever  knew  Nicole  Kidman  and  Ewan  McGregor  could  sing?  The  film  features  the  lyrics  to  Marilyn  Monroe's  ""Diamonds  are  a  Girls  Best  Friend"",  Elton  John's  ""Your  Song"",  Police's  ""Roxanne""  and  the  hilarious  performance  of  Madonna's  ""Like  a  Virgin"".  As  well  as  the  top  10  singles  ""Come  what  May""  and  ""Lady  Marmalade""  amongst  many  more,  forming  a  sensational  soundtrack.  Moulin  Rouge  on  DVD  is  a  worthwhile  investment,  worth  watching  over  and  over,  each  time  taking  you  on  a  roller  coaster  ride  that  has  you  giggling,  gasping,  crying  and  screaming  out  for  more.  An  unforgettable  and  unmissable  Australian  movie.  I  give  this  tragic  love  story  4  out  of  5. ",2002-04-15
"  Community  receives  confession   Staff  Reporter   MORE  than  700  Christians  came  together  at  the  University  of  New  South  Wales  recently  to  offer  a  collective  confession  for  “the  crimes  and  injustices  perpetrated  against  the  Jewish  people  through  the  centuries,  for  which  the  Christian  Church  bears  heavy  responsibility”.   On  behalf  of  the  Jewish  community,  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel  Rabbi  Richard  Lampert  received  a  copy  of  the  confession  from  Sister  Simone,  head  of  the  Australian  branch  of  the  Evangelical  Sisterhood  of  Mary.  The  original,  signed  by  30,000  Christians  around  the  world,  is  in  the  archives  of  the  State  of  Israel.   Last  week,  Rabbi  Lampert  presented  the  confession  to  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  executive  director  Sheila  Faktor.   £  In  deep  shame  and  contrition  ~  we  come  before  the  almighty  and  merciful  God  to  confess  the  crimes  and  injustices  perpetrated  against  the  Jewish  people  down  through  the  centuries,  for  which  the  Christian  Church  bears  heavy  responsibility.   We  confess  that  we  and  our  Christian  forefathers  often  showed   prejudice  and  antagonism  towards  our  elder  brother  Israel,  instead  of  loving  God’s  chosen  people.   Throughout  the  centuries,  the  Jewish  people  have  been  defamed  by  Christians  as  murderers  of  God;  and  to  this  day  the  teaching  persists  that  God  has  finished  with  His  covenant  people  Israel,  despite  the  clear  evidence  of  Scripture  to  the  contrary.   God’s  people  have  been  accused  of  well-poisoning  and  ritual  murder,  as  well  as  being  humiliated,  deprived  of  their  rights,  held  in   contempt  arid  persecuted.  The  horrific  murder  of  six  million  Jews  in  the  Holocaust  —  the  climax  of  a  long  history  of  flagrant  injustice  —  hangs  over  us  like  a  dark  cloud  to  this  day.   We  therefore  repent  and  plead  with  Almighty  God  that  He  might  have  mercy  upon  us  and  forgive  us  for  what  we  and  our  forefathers  have  done  to  His  chosen  people.   We  pledge  ourselves  to  work  tirelessly  against  antisemitism  in  all  its  forms  and  to  make  every  effort  to  ensure  that  respect  and  consideration  will  be  shown  on  the   part  of  the  Church  of  Jesus  Christ  towards  the  Jewish  people  in  the  light  of  God’s  everlasting  covenant   with  them.   We  seek  God’s  blessing  upon  His  covenant  people  in  Israel  and   worldwide.  Amen.  ^   ■  This  is  the  teat  of  the  confession.

"  Board  of  Deputies   condemns  Nile  remark   THE  leader  ship  of  the  New  South  Wales  Jewish  community   has  con  demned  last  week’s  call  by  Christian   Democrat  MP  Reverend  Fred  Nile  for  tradi  tional  Islamic  dress  to  be  banned  as  “inappropriate  and  misdi  rected”.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of   Fred  Nile   Deputies  Stephen  Rothman  con  demned  the  implicit  assumption  in  Reverend  Nile’s  statement  that  a  ter  rorist  would  have  a  particular  appear  ance  “or  would  dress  in  accordance   with  a  particular  religious  or  ethnic  grouping”.   “The  vast  majority  of  Muslims  in  Australia  are,  like  all  non-indigenous  Australians,  immigrants  or  the  descendants  of  immigrants  who  are  here  for  a  better  life  and  are  no  more  terrorists  than  is  Reverend  Nile,”  Mr  Rothman  said.   “It  is  not  the  experience,  even  in  Israel,  for  terrorists  to  be  dressed  in  traditional  Muslim  clothing,  and  any  form  of  clothing  could  conceal  suffi  cient  explosive.   “More  fundamentally,  govern  ments  in  Australia  must  be  vigilant  to  ensure  to  that  their  actions  and  law  secure  the  very  democracy  that  Reverend  Nile  purports  to  protect.   “Australia  is  one  of  the  most  toler   ant  and  inclusive  democracies  in  the  world;  Reverend  Nile’s  call  would  destroy  the  very  tolerance  and  demo  cratic  principles  that  he  says  he  seeks  to  protect.”   Protection  from  terrorism  includes,  “quintessentially,  the  battle  for  tolerance  by  and  for  all  faiths,  races  and  ethnic  groups  and  the  recognition  that  all  human  beings  are  entitled  to  have  their  beliefs  respected”,  Mr  Rothman  said.   Reverend  Nile’s  call  “is  an  exam   ple  of  throwing  the  baby  out  with  the   bathwater”.   “The  banning  of  cultural  clothing  —Muslim,  Jewish,  Sikh  or  Scottish—  is  unprincipled,  undemocratic  and   un-Australian.”   The  leader  of  the  Uniting  Church  expressed  concern  that  Reverend  Nile’s  comments  “may  give  the  false  impression  that  the  Australian  Christian  community  supports  intol  erance  toward  the  beliefs  and  prac  tices  of  Australian  Muslims”.   “We  support  the  right  of  Muslim  women  to  wear  whatever  clothing  they  feel  is  appropriate  in  accordance  with  their  beliefs,”  said  Reverend  Professor  James  Haire,  president  of  the  Uniting  Church.   Professor  Haire  also  expressed  concern  at  the  linking  of  religion  and  ethnicity  with  violent  acts,  pointing  out  that  terrorism  has  been  con  demned  by  Muslim,  Jewish  and  Christian  religious  leaders.   “The  Uniting  Church  is  committed  to  Australia  as  a  multicultural  country  in  which  the  beliefs  and  practices  of  people  of  all  faiths  are  respected.   “Now  more  than  ever,  it  is  vital  that  we  live  in  peace  and  with  understand  ing.” ",2002-11-29

"  Second  coming  ends  prematurely:   Jesus  shot  dead  in  Bethlehem   An  Israeli  tank  has  the  Messiah  in  its  sights   BETHLEHEM,  Monday:  The  second  coming  has  ended  prematurely  after  Jesus  Christ  become  the  latest  casualty  of  fighting  in  the  Middle  East.  Jesus  was  killed  after  he  returned  to  his  birthplace  of  Bethlehem  during  an   onslaught  by  the  Israeli  army.  It  is  believed  he  was  preparing  to  hand  out  retribution  to  sinners  and  end  the  world.  Eyewitnesses  claim  that  Jesus  was  killed  by  Israeli  tank  fire  while  seeking  shelter  in  a  local  Church.  An  Israeli  spokesperson  described  the  killing  as  ""easier  than  the  first  time"".  Jesus's  father,  God,  and  close  relative,  the  Holy  Spirit,  have  both  expressed  grief  at  the  death.  ""I  told  him  that  Bethlehem  was  too  dangerous  nowadays,""  said  God.  ""But  do  you  think  he  would  listen  to  his  father?  I'm  never  wrong  about  things  like  this,  or  anything  in  fact.""  Leaders  of  Christian  nations  all  over  the  world  have  called  for  an  end  to  the  fighting  as  a  result  of  the  death.  ""I  don't  mind  a  few  hundred  Palestinians  dying,  but  killing  a  Christian,  let  alone  Christianity's  founder,  is  taking  it  too  far,""  said  US  President  George  W.  Bush.  There  are  reports  that  Jesus  may  have  risen  from  the  dead  three  days  after  being  shot.  Unfortunately  he  was  killed  again  by  a  suicide  bomber  while  enjoying  a  coffee  in  Jerusalem. ",2002-04-12
"  schmundamentalist   Dear  Woroni,  Why  don't  you  ever  speak  out  about  Murdoch,  USA  killings  of  10,000  civilians  in  Afghanistan!!  I  love  China  very  much  and  have  seen  first  hand  how  Chinese  au-  thorities  treat  religious  organisa-  tions  such  as  Buddhist  Groups,  Hindu  groups,  Moslem  groups   and  Christian  groups.  I  am  writ-  ing  to  tell  you  that  the  West  is  mis-  representing  your  ban  of  the  Falung  Gong  organisation.  I  am  an  expert  in  religion  and  the  New  Age  movement  and  lived  in  Beijing,  China,  for  a  year  in  1999  to  tell  your  government  about  the  worldwide  New  Age  movement  and  how  important  it  is  and  how  it  directly  affects  China  and  its  fu-  ture.  While  in  Beijing  I  saw  no  re-   ligious  persecution.  There  is  no  doubt  that  some  religious  groups  are  extremely  EVIL.  Christian  fundamentalists  are  very  evil.  I  truly  believe  that  fundamentalism  of  any  kind  is  evil.  Buddhist  fun-  damentalism,  Hindu  fundamen-  talism,  Moslem  Fundamentalism,  Jewish  fundamentalism  and  Chris-  tian  fundamentalism.  I  strongly  advise  your  government  that  religious  fundamentalism  is  extremely  dangerous  for  your  country.  I  am  a  very  strong  social-  ist  who  has  a  very  spiritual  side  and  am  deeply  involved  in  the  New  Age  movement  in  the  West.  Even  in  the  New  Age  movement  there  is  fundamentalism  and  it  makes  me  sick.  I  have  seen  first  hand  Chris-  tian  fundamentalism.  It  is  far  worse  than  the  Falong  Gong  movement.  If  you  think  the  Falong  Gong  movement  is  bad  you  should  examine  the  funda-  mentalist  Christians  who  make  me  sick.  They  are  rightwing  and  sup-  port  human  rights  abusers  around  the  world.  I  strongly  believe  that  a  spiritual  life  cannot  be  achieved  without  a  good  socialist  infrastruc-  ture  first  which  is  what  China  is  trying  to  provide.  I  have  written  to  the  China  Daily  many  times  with  my  research  in  physics  which  explains  much  paranormal  phe-  nomenon.  China  is  the  most  important  coun-  try  in  the  world  but  is  not  under-  stood  well.  I  have  seen  religious  fundamentalist  organisations  cause  great  harm  and  evil.  I  now  believe  that  the  Falung  Gong  organisation  may  certainly  be  trying  to  be  dis-  ruptive,  especially  by  being  con-  trolled  by  foreign  organisations.  You  as  a  government  and  a  coun-  try  must  make  your  case  clear  and  outline  to  the  rest  of  the  world  that  you  ARE  tolerant  of  religions  as  long  as  they  do  not  become  ex-  tremist  and  threaten  social  order.  I  urge  you  to  gather  as  much  in-  formation  on  this  and  present  a  book  to  the  world  explaining  how  religious  freedom  is  certainly  tol-  erated.  I  know  some  major  Chi  Gong  masters  are  in  fact  promoted  by  your  government  and  many  martial  artists  are  promoted  such  as  the  spiritual  Shaolin  Buddhist  Monks  of  the  Hernan  Province.  I  urge  your  government  and  coun-  try  to  be  extremely  careful  as  no  doubt  you  are.  You  know  that  the  western  media  is  terribly  unfair  to  China  because  of  their  capitalist  bent.  I  am  on  the  side  of  China  very  much  and  I  hope  this  can  be  sorted  out  as  soon  as  possible.  It  is  not  good  for  China's  interna-  tional  reputation.  I  urge  you  to  show  how  tolerant  of  religions  you  are.  You  certainly  showed  me  when  I  lived  in  Beijing  that  spir-  itual  tolerance  is  there.  I  believe  at  present  that  NO  religion  should  be  more  powerful  than  the  state  because  all  the  religions  we  have  at  the  moment  are  corrupt.  I  cer-  tainly  agree  that  many  religions  cause  great  harm.  But  as  I  stress  I  am  a  committed  spiritual  person  doing  a  PhD  in  the  philosophy  of  physics,  a  meditation  teacher  who  has  been  in  many  Eastern  sects  in   Buddhism  and  Hinduism.  I  follow  Sai  Baba  in  India  very  closely  and  most  Sai  Devotees  are  socialists  first  then  spiritual  second  -  or  many  are  socialist  and  spiritual  at  the  same  time,  which  is  what  I  am.  I  want  to  stress  that  spirituality  is  very  important  to  my  life  but  it  should  certainly  not  become  a  threat.  Yours  sincerely,  Michael  Dargaville ",2002-04-01

"  Helping  hand  from  Christian  school   AVIVA  BARD   A  CHRISTIAN  school  has  lent  a   helping  hand  to  Yeshiva  College  -  sending  it  a  truckload  of  fresh  food  for  its  beleaguered  teachers.   Responding  to  the  Yeshiva  parents’  financial  woes  and  the  unpaid  salaries  owed  to  staff,  Penrith-based  St  Paul’s  Grammar  sent  “extraordinary  amounts”  of  fresh  fruit  and  vegeta  bles,  toiletries  and  groceries,  Yeshiva  acting  principal  Alida  Markovics  said.   “There  were  baskets  filled  with   groceries.  We  were  a  bit  embarrassed,   but  it  was  greatly  appreciated.  The  staff  of  the  preschool,  high  school  and  primary  school  sent  a  letter  of  thanks,  and  gave  them  honey  cakes,  explain  ing  the  custom  of  Rosh  Hashanah.”   St  Paul’s  Grammar  principal  John   Collier:  “Our  staff  saw  teachers  in  another  school  in  need.  We’re  a  Christian  school  and  it  seemed  a   compassionate  thing  to  do.   “We  were  flattered  by  the  expres  sions  of  gratitude.  It  was  a  way  of  sup  porting  fellow  educators.  If  we’re  able  to  provide  some  relief,  then  we’re  very  pleased.” ",2003-10-03
"  DIONNE  MOSKOW   IT'S  quite  unusual  that  a  group  of  non-Jewish  women  profess  to  be   Zionistic.   Forming  a  link  between  non  Jewish  and  Jewish  women  in  Australia,  Kesher  Friends  of  Women's  International  Zionist   Organisation  (WIZO)  was  formed  by  Brisbane  resident  Rose  Toms,  who  said  she  ""just  wanted  to  help  Israel"".   They  have  a  strong  dedication  and  desire  to  help  women  arid  chil  dren  in  Israel,  similar  to  the  objec  tives  of  WIZO.   Totalling  175  members  Australia  wide,  including  Queensland,  South  Australia  and  recently  established  on  the  north  shore,  Kesher  works  in  tan  dem  with  WIZO  Australia.   ""Kesher  means  'link'.  This  is  what  we  are  conveying  in  our  love,  sup  port  and  involvement  with  the  Jewish  people,""  Toms  said.   In  1990,  Toms  visited  Yad  Vashem  in  Israel.  After  walking  through  the  Avenue  of  Trees  —  a  path  that  pays  homage  to  the  Righteous  Among  the  Nations  who  helped  save  the  lives  of  many  Jews  during  the  Holocaust  —  she  realised  that,  like  many  other  non-Jewish   Kesher  Friends  of  WiZO  founder  Rose  Toms.   Back:  WIZO  Leah  president  Bertha  Meyerson,  didgeridoo  player  John  Hunter,  Kesher  Friends  of  WIZO  North  Shore  president  Pamela  Ogaard,   Aboriginal  guest  speaker  Marie  Melito,  Kesher  members  Jan  Figgis  and  Jack  Henderson,  WIZO  North  Shore  co-ordinator  Bonita  Levy,  Kesher   member  Carole  Koroknay.

""There  were  many  people  who  had  shown  genuine  love  and  had  given  their  lives  to  helping.   ""  It  was  at  that  place  that  I  made  a  promise  that  with  god's  help  I  would  do  everything  I  could  to  help  Jewish  children,""  she  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.   When  Toms  returned,  she  learned  about  the  work  of  WIZO  and  decid  ed  that  by  being  involved,  she  could  fulfil  her  desire  to  help  Jews.  ""Here  was  an  opportunity  to  show  support   and  love  and  to  break  down  fears  and  misunderstandings  between  Christians  and  Jews,""  she  said.   Toms  joined  WIZO  Aviva  and  in  1994  she  was  appointed  president  of  Kesher  Friends  of  WIZO  Brisbane,  which  currently  stands  at  157  mem  bers  spanning  Cairns,  Lismore,  Casino  and  the  Sunshine  Coast.   In  June  last  year  Kesher  spread  to  Sydney.   North  shore  resident  Pamela  Ogaard  was  introduced  to  Toms  at  a  Christian  prayer  group.  After  spend  ing  seven  months  volunteering  in  Israel,  Ogaard  felt  that  she  wanted  to  continue  her  support  for  Israel  and  decided  to  establish  her  own  Kesher  group.   Ogaard  inspired  members  from  her  local  Christian  prayer  group  to  join  Kesher,  and  in  the  one  year  it's  been  operating,  she  has  built  the  group  to  20  members.   ""Being  part  of  Kesher  is  about  standing  beside  our  Jewish  sisters  and  being  aware  of  the  history.  If  we  can  make  a  difference  then  I  think  that's  good,""  Ogaard  said.   Working  in  tandem  with  WIZO  North  Shore  co-ordinator  Bonita  Levy  and  WIZO  federal  president  Rony  Bognar,  the  groups  raise  funds  for  women  and  children  in  Israel,  partic  ularly  focusing  on  Ahuzat  Yeladim  —  a  school  in  Haifa  for  emotionally  dis   turbed  children.   WIZO  NSW  president  Gilla  Liberman:  ""They  [Kesher  members]  are  genuine,  supportive  and  lovely  women.  The  funds  are  wonderful  but  having  the  support  from  non  Jewish  members  is  even  more  impor  tant  to  lift  awareness  in  the  general  community  about  the  Israeli  situa   tion.""   Bognar:  ""I  admire  members  of  Kesher  for  their  vast  knowledge  of  Israel  and  Zionism.   ""They  are  always  willing  to  be  totally  supportive  of  Israel  and  Jews  alParound  the  world.  We  could  use  all  the  friends  we  can  get.""   Levy  agreed:  ""As  Jewish  people,  we  need  all  the  friends  we  can  possi  bly  have.  The  people  from  Kesher  feel  so  passionately  about  Israel  and  about  Jewish  people  and  it's  won   derful  to  have  friends  like  that.   They  are  the  most  inspirational   group  of  women  that  anyone  could   ever  come  across"".   Last  year,  Kesher  joined  WIZO  North  Shore  at  their  annual  Succot  and  Chanukah  functions.   At  Kesher's  inaugural  function  in  June  last  year,  former  Israeli  consul  general  Effi  Ben-Matityahu  attended.   ""It  was  great  to  have  an  Israeli  attend,  especially  someone  who  knows  what  the  current  situation  is  like  for  women  and  children  in  Israel,""  Ogaard  said.   |  “Being  part  of  Kesher  is  I  about  standing  beside   l  our  Jewish  sisters  and   l   being  aware  of  the   history.  If  we  can  make  a  difference  then  I  think  that's  good.”   PAMELA  OGAARD   Kesher  Friends  of  WIZO  president   Kesher's  most  recent  function,  which  was  co-organised  by  Ogaard  and  WIZO  Leah  president  Bertha  Meyerson  (Levy's  mother),  Jewish,  Christian  and  Aboriginal  women  spent  the  morning  informing  mem  bers  from  other  faiths  through  spo  ken,  written  and  performance  dialogue.   In  an  effort  to  collect  more  funds,  Toms  opened  an  opportunity  shop  in  November  last  year  in  the  main  street  of  Nambour,  Brisbane.   Generous  prayer  group  communi  ty  members  have  donated  products  and  have  also  given  their  time  to  work  in  the  store.   Toms:  ""The  generous  donations  of  goods  we  have  received  from  community  members,  the  steady  flow  of  customers  and  the  dedica  tion  of  their  volunteers  means  we   cannot  help  but  be  successful.""

"  Risque  cocktail  names  trouble  Christian  barmaid   Williams...  believes  God  doesn't  want  her  serving  Hard  Ons   MELBOURNE:  A  local  barmaid  has  called  for  a  host  of  cocktails,  including  such  as  Hard  Ons,  Sex  on  the  Beach  and  Orgasms,  to  be  renamed  in  order  to  accommodate  her  wholesome  Christian  beliefs.  ""As  a  Christian  I've  promised  God  I'll  save  myself  for  the  man  I   marry,  so  being  asked  for  a  Quick  Fuck  every  night  causes  me  extreme  discomfort,""  admitted  Emily  Williams,  24,  in  the  middle  of  her  shift  at  a  Melbourne  bar.  ""Especially  when  I  have  to  say  'yes'  every  time.""  Williams  usually  deals  with  embarrassing  orders  by  ducking  under  the  counter  to  perform  a  series  of  rapid  fire  Hail  Marys.  ""I  was  prepared  to  overlook  the  vending  machine  in  the  toilet  that  distributes  contraceptive  devices,""  she  says,  ""but  this  is  a  bit  much.  I'm  devoted  to  the  word  of  the   Lord,  and  I'm  pretty  sure  that  word  doesn't  include  69ers  and  Cocksucking  Cowboys.""  Bar  Manager  Hamish  Greig  says  he  sympathises  with  Williams's  dilemma,  but  he  is  not  willing  to  accommodate  the  alternative  cocktail  names  she  favours.  ""I  can't  really  see  'Marital  Love  on  the  Beach'  driving  up  sales,""  he  says.  ""And  no  matter  how  good  it  tastes  I'd  never  order  a  Christ-  loving  Cowboy.""  But  while  Williams  confesses  she  is  ""always  on  the  lookout  for  a  career  that's  slightly  less  likely  to  send  her  to  hell"",  she  admits  her  current  job  is  preferable  to  her  preview  place  of  work,  Big  Phil's  Adult  Bookshop.  ""Dear  Lord,""  she  says,  rolling  her  eyes,  ""If  I'd  had  to  explain  to  one  more  person  how  a  Four  Pronged  Anal  Probe  works,  I  think  I  would  have  died."" ",2003-03-21

Reviewer:  PTE  Simone  Heyer   Being  a  winner  in  the  Berlin  film  festival  doesn't  guarantee  a  good  film.  But  this  film  is  unforgettable.  The  Experiment  is  about  Tarek  Fahd   (Bleibtreu),  who  wants  to  earn  a  bit  of  extra  cash  and  replies  to  a  newspaper  ad  looking  for  people  to  take  part  in  a  simu  lated  prison-style  experiment.  The  job  pays  well  for  two  weeks  in  solitary  confinement.  Tarek  was  a  print  journalist  until  it  became  too  stressful,  so  he  began  driving  taxis.  He  goes  into  the  experiment  with  a  view  to  write  a  winning  story  with  photos  acquired  from  Bond-style  glasses.  What  ensues  is  a  Lord  of  the  Flies-  typo.  scenario  where  a  group  of  ordinary  '  men  are  separated  in  two  -  the  guards  and  the  prisoners.  It's  interesting  to  see  how  they  take  to  their  roles  in  the  prison,  where  in  ciwie  street  they'd  co-exist.  People  with  normally  weak  natures  are  put  into  a  guard  role  and  their  sense  of  self-worth  increased  with  their  exer  tion  of  power  over  the  prisoners.  One  particularly  sick  guard  coerces  the  rest  of  the  guards  to  his  way  of  think  ing  and  before  long  the  experiment  esca  lates  out  of  control.  It's  left  to  Tarek  and  his  Air  Force  cell-mate  to  end  the  experiment  and  re  store  order.  This  brilliant  film  will  make  you  sick  to  the  stomach  and  your  palms  sweat.

"  From  the  board  walk  to  the  catwalk  (a  seamless  segue)  Christian  Dior's  Fall  collection  was  revealed  in  Paris  this  week.  Euro-trash  Queen,  John  Galliano,  revealed  his  Asian  inspired  collection  that  will  set   the  benchmark  for  the  fashionable  and  the  victim.  Media  releases  stated  Galliano  had  really  ""embraced  the  Japanese  inspired  kimono,  this  season""  -  which  surprised  everyone,  especially  considering  how  influential  the  Bulgarian  inspired  Kimono  has  been.  But  tautological  PR  errors  aside,  Gallie  has  grabbed  the  kimono  by  both  oversized  lapels  and  thrown  it  firmly  up  on  stage.  To  successfully  look  Diorable  this  season  you  will  need  to  be  6  foot  5,  apply  a  thick  layer  of   acrylic,  white  wall  paint  to  your  face  (preferably  with  a  roller),  and  don  a  kimono  made  from  material  left  over  from  the  interior  of  space  shuttle  Challenger.  ""Must  have""  accessories  this  season  include  small,  Chinese  female  acrobats  who  somersault  and  leap  through  the  air  beside  you.  Galliano  apparently  got  this  idea  after  mistakenly  watching  a  documentary  on  Chinese  female  infanticide.  When  he  discovered  it  was  cheaper  to  buy  three  female  acrobats  than  it  was  to  have  a  handbag  made  from  an  Ostrich  Egg,  a  new  fashion  was  born.  The  small  acrobats  fold  up  neatly  after  use  and  can  be  stored  in  your  cupboard  for  up  to  three  months.   Who?  John  Galliano  and  Christiona  Dior  Where?

"  Reverend  Phillip  Jensen...  All  non   Christian  religions  are  “monstrous  lies”.   Leaders   condemn  dean’s   outburst   ALLOW  LEE   JEWISH  religious  leaders  have  condemned  Sydney  Anglican.  Dean  Phillip  Jensen’s  comments  that  all  non-Christian  religions  are  “the  monstrous  lies  and  deceits  of  Satan  devised  to  destroy  the  life  of  the  believers”.   Speaking  at  St  Andrew’s   Cathedral  at  his  induction  as  the  11th  dean  of  Sydney,  Reverend  Jensen  launched  a  scathing  attack  on  political  correctness,  secular  ism  and  religious  relativism  for  denying  Christians  the  right  to  speak  publicly  about  their  belief  in  the  uniqueness  of  Jesus  and  Christianity.   “If  one  view  is  right,  the  others  must  be  wrong.  We  must  stop  the  stupidity  of  stretching  social  tol  erance  into  religious  or  philo  sophical  relativism,”  he  said.   He  acknowledged  that  there  were  many  “lovely  wonderful  Hindus  and  Muslims  and  Jews  and  atheists”,  “but  their  different  religions  cannot  all  be  right.  Some  or  all  of  them  are  wrong.  And  if  wrong,  [they]  are  the  monstrous  lies  and  deceits  of  Satan  -  devised  to  destroy  the  life   of  the  believers.”   Interfaith  activist  Great   Synagogue  Senior  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  condemned  Reverend  Jensen’s  language  as  “inflammatory,  extreme  and  inap  propriate”  for  a  religious  leader.   “He  claims  he  wasn’t  particu  larly  attacking  Jews  and  Muslims,  but  the  media,  and  the  notion  that  every  philosophy  is  equally  valid.   “But  if  the  rest  of  us  get  caught  up  in  this  attack  on  the  media,  and  mud  sticks,  that  is  not  acceptable.”   While  the  Anglican  Church  participates  in  interfaith  dialogue,  Rabbi  Apple  lamented  the  fact  that  there  was  no  direct  dialogue  between  Anglicans  and  Jews.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  said  he  was  heart  ened  by  the  number  of  Anglicans  “who  contacted  me  to  express  outrage  at  the  comments.  That  is  a  good  indication  of  how  most  Australian  Christians  feel  about  other  faiths.”  There  is  “a  very  good  level  of  interfaith  dialogue”  in  Australia,  which  is  “all  the  more  reason”  why  there  should  be  direct  dialogue  with  Anglicans,   he  added.

"  THE  Jewish  community  needs  to  understand  fully  “the  dramatic  changes  which  have  occurred  within   the  Christian  churches  in  recent  years  in  their  positive  stance  towards,  and  relations  with,  the  Jewish  world”,  Henry  Mendelson  has  urged.   “The  Jewish  community  needs  to  be  aware  of  the  transformation  which  has  taken  place,”  the  past  president  of  the  NSW  Council  of   Christians  and  Jews  said.   “It  needs  to  appreciate  that  the  Christian  world  today  abounds  with  persons  who  are  genuine  friends  and  allies  of  the  Jewish  people.   “These  facts  seem  hardly  known  within  the  Jewish  community,”  he  pointed  out,  suggesting  that  “this  is  because  the  way  we  have  viewed  Christianity  has  been  the  result  of  the  way  we  have  been  received  by   it”.   Mendelson  appealed  to  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  for  greater  acceptance  of  the  Council’s  work  by  the  Jewish  community,  and  for  more  active  participation  in  the  Council’s  activities  “in  order  to  understand  our  commonalities  and  respect  our  differences”.   “If  we  insist  on  sitting  in  a  corner,  refusing  to  speak  to  the  other,  how  can  we  ever  understand  what  they  have  to  say?

In  a  brief  ceremony  at  the  muse  um’s  annual  general  meeting,  the  Council  president,  Salvation  Army  Major  Graham  Harris,  said  his  exec  utive  had  for  many  years  been  aware  of  the  outreach  which  the  museum   achieves  from  a  Jewish  perspective  into  the  broader  community.   “The  work  of  the  museum  in  pre  senting  the  Jewish  community  to  its  Christian  neighbours  dramatically  parallels  the  work  of  the  Council  in  striving  for  mutual  understanding  between  the  faiths”,  Major  Harris  said.   In  presenting  the  Certificate  of  Appreciation  to  museum  president  John  Roth,  Council  past  president  Henry  Mendelson  stressed  the  importance  of  the  museum’s  posi  tive  impact  on  the  younger  genera   tion.   “The  Jewish  community  needs  to  be  aware  of  the  dramatic  transformation  which  has  taken  place.”   He  pointed  out  that  the  Council  was  in  the  process  of  establishing  a  younger  age  group  on  university  campuses,  aimed  at  ensuring  “that  the  prejudices  and  mis-teachings  of  the  past  are  put  to  rest  and  that  the  next  generation  can  gain  a  true  understanding  of  the  commonalities  between  the  Christian  and  Jewish  faiths  and  a  respect  for  their  differ   ences”.   “The  museum  is  highly  successful  in  this  direction  every  day  of  the  week,  and  for  this  the  Council  recog  nises  its  proud  history  of  achieve  ments,”  he  added.

Good  parents  know  that  each  child  has  to  be  allowed  to  develop  in  their  own  unique  way.   The  nations  of  the  world  are  all  God’s  children.  He  doesn’t  treat  them  all  the  same  because  they  aren’t  all  the  same.  He  wants  each  nation  to  develop  in  its  own  way.   So  each  nation  has  a  different  path  to  reach  their  full  potential.  To  the  Jewish  nation  he  gave  the  Torah   as  our  way  of  expressing  our  souls.  But  Judaism  is  not  for  everyone.  We  don’t  believe  that  a  non-Jew  needs  to  become  Jewish  to  find  God.   Just  like  a  musically-talented  child  shouldn’t  be  forced  to  play  soc  cer.  Anyone  is  welcome  to  convert,  but  that  is  up  to  them.  In  fact,  it  is  for  this  reason  that  unlike  other  reli  gions  that  encourage  conversion,  Judaism  attempts  to  persuade  potential  converts  not  to  adopt  that  path  unless  they  have  a  really  good  reason  for  doing  so.   God  created  different  nations   because  each  has  a  unique  contribu  tion  to  offer  the  world.  Maybe  your  “mission”  should  be  to  ensure  that  your  nation  fulfils  that  purpose.

"  Melbourne  takes  charge   By  LEUT  Matt  Carroll   Commander  Vern  Dutschke  and  his  ship's  company  in  HMAS  Melbourne  have  relieved  CAPT  Gerry  Christian  and  his  team  in   HMAS  Newcastle  on  Operation  Catalyst  duties  in  the  Arabian  Gulf.  Newcastle  is  returning  to  Australia.  HMAS  Melbourne  did  a  fuel  stop  in  Diego  Garcia  on  November  13  while  en-route  to  the  area  of  opera  tion.  The  fuel  stop  was  delayed  by  a  day  because  of  the  closure  of  the  US   Navy  port  as  a  precaution  against  an  approaching  cyclone.  After  embarking  fuel  and  stores  Melbourne  travelled  ""at  speed""  to  make  up  the  lost  day  and  rendezvous  with  her  sister  FFG.  Four  days  and  2000  nautical  miles  later,  Melbourne  arrived  on  time  to  conduct  a  dual  ""replenish  ment  at  sea""  with  USNS  Pecos  and  relieve  Newcastle.  The  FFGs  then  conducted  officer  of  the  watch  manoeuvres  and  per  sonnel  transfers  for  hand-over  brief  ings  before  Melbourne  bid  farewell  to  Newcastle.  Along  with  the  hand-over  briefs   an  opportunity  arose  for  some  fam  ily  reunions  between  members  of  the  two  ship's  companies.  These  included  a  de-facto  couple,  two  sets  of  brothers  and  two  cousins.  As  Newcastle  faded  from  the  radar  screens,  Melbourne  looked  ahead  to  the  Straits  of  Hormuz  and  the  Arabian  Gulf.  Melbourne  has  now  officially  taken  over  as  the  sea  bome  presence  of  the  Navy  in  the  Middle  East.  Operation  Catalyst  will  see  the  ship  and  her  ship's  company  away  from  their  families,  friends  and  loved  ones  over  Christmas  and  early  2004.

"  11CSSB  drive   By  Cpl  Christian  Frost   IN  THE  past  18  months  11CSSB  has  seen  a  steady  flow  of  reserve  members  transfer  to  ARA.  The  unit's  dedication  to   interesting  and  relevant  training  activities  has  demonstrated  to  these  members  what  a  full-time  career  in  the  Army  can  offer.  Since  January  2002,  there  have  been  around  25  transfers  by  ORs,  SNCOs  and  officers,  from  many  corps  and  trades.  Additionally,  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  the  num  bers  of  members  transferring  from  the  ARA  to  the  reserve.  This  is  due  to  increased  pres  ence  of  the  units  ,  recruiting  staff  at  the  local  transition  seminars.  The  obvious  benefits  to  the  Army  are  the  retention  of;  trained  personnel.  Members  receive  ongoing  training  and  promotion  courses  and  if  required  they  maintain  the  option  of  transferring  back  to  the  ARA  rather  than  having  to  go  through  the  process  of  re-  enlistment.

Which  is  precisely  what  a  Sydney  Muslim,  Christian  and  Jew  are  attempting  to  do  under  the  banner  of  the  Goodness  and  Kindness  program,  run  by  North  Shore  Chabad  House.   Rabbi  Zalman  Kastel,  Australia  Fair  (formerly  Australian  Muslim  News)  editor  Kuranda  Seyit  and  Catholic  theology  student  Joe  Sheri  dan  regularly  visit  schools  to  expose  students  to  representatives  of  all  three  faiths  and  the  need  for  tolerance.   The  program  has  been  augmented  by  similar  exchange  programs  in  Mel  bourne  run  by  Mount  Scopus  College  and  Bialik  College.   “We  don’t  feel  it’s  enough,”  Seyit  said,  “so  we  do  follow-ups  and  work   with  teachers.   “We  need  to  open  the  doors  for  dialogue.  Young  people  are  the  most  perceptive.  They  haven’t  formulated  their  ideas  yet,  and  it’s  vital  to  work  with  them  to  lay  the  foundations  for  future  happenings.  Our  aim  is  to   reach  thousands  of  kids.”   The  program  has  received  NSW  Government  accreditation  and  a  $50,000  federal  grant.  About  100  schools  have  requested  a  visit.   “There  are  misconceptions  about  Jewish  people  that  I  don’t  think  about  because  I’m  too  worried  about  the   misconceptions  of  Islam,”  Seyit  said.   “Israel  is  the  most  divisive  issue  in  the  world.  It’s  not  just  a  Muslim-Jew  ish  thing;  a  lot  of  Christian  people   think  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  must  be  solved  to  go  forward.   It  undermines  the  progress  between  Muslims  and  Jews.  Its  the  most  challenging  issue  we  need  to  talk  about.  Here  in  Australia  we  need  to  show  how  we  can  get  along  as  human  beings;  we  can  show  the  politicians  that  Israelis,  Palestinians,  Muslims  and  Jews  can  get  along  very  well.”   One  of  three  initiators  of  the  Women’s  Interfaith  Network  (WIN),  Aziza  Abdel-Halim  -  together  with  Ethnic  Communities  Council  deputy  chair  and  ECAJ  honorary  secretary  Josie  Lacey  -  expressed  dismay  that  people  still  have  not  worked  out  that  war  does  not  solve  problems.   “The  only  way  is  to  listen  from  a  position  of  mutual  respect  and  always  hope  to  solve  the  problem,”  she  said.  “Nothing  can  be  solved  except  by  dia  logue.   “They’re  people  I’ve   j  befriended.They're  not  |  extremists.

"  Jews  For  Jesus  advert  slammed   PETER  KOHN   THE  Christian  evangelical  move  ment,  Jews  For  Jesus,  has  played  on   the  festival  of  Chanukah  in  a  news   paper  advertisement  to  offer  readers  an  American  book,  A  Messianic  Look  at  Christmas  and  Hanukkah.   The  December  9  advertisement  appeared  in  the  Australian  Financial   Review.   Executive  Council  of  Australian   Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  said  Jews  For  Jesus  usually  focuses  its  activities  on  Sydney,  and  the  adver   tisement  is  a  bid  to  showcase  itself  to   its  financial  supporters  and  potential   backers.   While  the  Catholic  Church  has   explicitly  rejected  proselytising,  some  Anglican  churches  support  the  activities  of  Jews  For  Jesus,  he  said.   “Their  [Jews  For  Jesus’]  message  is  deceitful.  They’re  not  Jewish,  they’re  Christian,  regardless  of  what   they  were  before  they  Christian.   “They  don’t  say‘Italians  for  Jesus’  or  ‘Greeks  for  Jesus’,  so  they’re  not  talking  about  an  ethnic  side  of  Judaism,  they’re  talking  about  a  reli  gious  side.   “They’re  trying  to  say  to  Jewish  people  who  don’t  know  terribly  much  about  Judaism  that  you’re  able  to  be  both  [Jewish  and  a  believer  in  Jesus].”   Jones  said  the  ECAJ  was  engaging  in  dialogue  with  churches  about  Jews  For  Jesus  and  similar  organisa  tions.  Ultimately,  rabbis  and  families  are  the  most  effective  protection  for  those  who  might  be  vulnerable  to  their  message.   Jews  For  Jesus  is  a  San  Francisco  based  organisation  founded  in  the  1950s  by  Martin  Rosen,  a  former  Jew  who  converted  to  Christianity,  became  a  Baptist  minister  and  was  assigned  to  serve  the  American  Board  of  Missions  -  a  missionary  movement  which  targets  Jews.

"  eeting  the  neighbours   A  MUSLIM,  a  Buddhist  a  Hindu  and  a  Jew  came  together  recently  to  dis  cuss  life  as  members  of  a  minority  faith  in  a  predominantly  Christian  society.   “Come  Meet  the  Neighbours”  was   the  theme  of  the  session  at  the  10th   Assembly  of  the  Uniting  Church  of  Australia,  attended  by  800  people.   Representing  the  Jewish  commu  nity  was  Peta  Jones  Pellach,  Director  of  Adult  Education  at  The  Shalom  Institute,  who  outlined  the  values  which  require  Jews  to  respond  to  those  in  need  and  to  stand  up  for  their  prin  ciples.   Referring  to  an  Indonesian  dele  gate  who  had  described  a  visit  to  Iraq  with  Muslim  women  as  creating  a  “human  shield”,  she  suggested  “another  perspective  on  the  so-called   ‘human  shield’.   “I  said  how  proud  I  was  of  my  daughter  who  has  made  aliyah  and  explained  that  she  did  not  want  to  sit  in  comfort  while  our  brothers  and  sisters  in  Israel  laced  the  threat  of  terrorism.   “But  by  making  her  life  in  Jerusalem,  she  is  not  a  ‘human  shield’.  ‘Human  shield’  implies  that  you  are  dealing  with  people  who  respect  life.  Her  risk  is  greater.   “Like  all  Israelis,  living  her  daily  life  is  heroic.  It  exemplifies  the  biblical  injunction  of  ‘not  standing  by  while  your  neighbour’s  blood  is  being  spilt’.   “The  next  day,  many  delegates  sought  me  out  to  say  they  were  pray  ing  for  my  daughter.  I  had  succeeded  in  making  them  see  Israel  a  little  dif  ferently,  if  only  for  a  while.”   However,  the  issue  that  raised  the   greatest  response  was  the  role  of  women.  Asked  if  women  in  Judaism  faced  similar  issues  to  those  faced  by  women  in  the  Church,  Jones  Pellach  said  she  spoke  about  the  discrimina  tion  against  women  which  stems  from  ignorance  or  sexist  attitudes  which  have  sources  outside  Judaism.   “I  told  them  about  Women’s  Tefillah  groups  in  the  Orthodox  world  and  said  I  was  proud  to  wear  the  tag  ‘Orthodox  feminist’.   “This  is  a  burning  issue  for  the  Uniting  Church  and  it  made  them  feel  good  to  know  that  Jewish  women,  too,  have  a  struggle.”   Jones  Pellach  urged  those  present  to  show  “zero  tolerance”  towards  antisemitic  comments  or  incidents.   The  evening  was  chaired  by  Wilma   Viswanathan  of  the  National  Council  of  Churches  of  Australia,  while  Unit  ing  Church  president  Reverend  Dr  Dean  Drayton  and  Reverend  Ray  Richmond  urged  delegates  to  deal  with  their  neighbours  with  love  and  respect   Peta  Jones  Pellach ",2003-08-29
"  Growing  fast   THE  most  common  non-Christian  religion  in  Woollahra  is  Judaism,  with  6664  followers,  or  16.3  per  cent  of  the  Woollahra  community,  accord  ing  to  the  community  portrait  pre  pared  by  the  Public  Practice  Pty  Ltd  for  Woollahra  Council.   The  religion  with  the  largest  increase  in  population  was  Judaism,  while  the  biggest  fall  was  for  Angli   can.   Sydney-wide,  the  Jewish  commu  nity  accounts  for  0.9  per  cent  of  the  population.   The  Census  results  are  an  impor  tant  resource  for  elected  officials  in  the  Woollahra  area.  Given  the  con  tinued  rise  in  the  Jewish  population,  no  elected  official  in  the  area  can  afford  to  ignore  Jewish  issues.   It  is  my  belief  that  the  Jewish  community  does  not  want  elected  officials  to  pander  to  our  viewpoint,  but  we  expect  our  parliamentarians  and  councillors  to  take  a  principled  and  consistent  stand  on  issues  that  are  important  to  us.

"  Gibson’s  film  ‘a  setback  to  interfaith  relations’   JACQU1  GAL   DR  JOHN  Pawlikowski  dedicates  himself  to  improving  Jewish-Christ  ian  relations,  but  a  Hollywood  film  threatens  to  uproot  some  of  his  work.   Addressing  a  mixed-faith  audience  at  NCJW  Council  House  last  week,  the  Christian  scholar  expressed  deep   concern  at  Mel  Gibson’s  film  The  Pas  sion,  due  for  release  next  Easter.   Reportedly  costing  the  actor  director  $40  million,  the  film  depicts  the  last  12  hours  in  the  life  of  Jesus,  with  Jews  presented  as  “bloodthirsty  and  vengeful”,  according  to  reports.   The  film  purportedly  blames  Jews  for  the  death  of  Jesus,  in  contradic  tion  to  a  1965  Vatican  statement.   World  president  of  the  Interna  tional  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  (ICCJ),  Dr  Pawlikowski  said  the  film  would  set  back  Christian-Jewish  rela  tions  and  described  it  as  “one  of  the   worst  things  we’ve  seen  in  25-30  years”.   It  depicted  a  “bloodthirsty  Jewish   cabal”  who  blackmailed  Pontius  Pilot  into  putting  Jesus  to  death,  he  said.   A  spokesperson  for  Gibson  told   Dr  Pawlikowski  that  the  film  con  forms  with  the  Vatican’s  directives  on   Jews  -  a  claim  which  Dr  Pawlikowsky  said  he  felt  compelled  to  challenge.   Established  in  Britain  after  World  War  II,  the  ICCJ  fosters  Christian-Jew  ish  dialogue  and  opposes  antisemitism.

Gibson’s  film  notwithstanding,  Dr  Pawlikowski  said  he  was  proud  of   recent  interfaith  advances.   The  ICCJ  is  gradually  incorporat  ing  Islam  into  its  work.  Trilateral  con  ferences  with  Muslim  scholars  are  the  beginning  of  a  process  which  took  Jews  and  Christians  2000  years  to  accomplish,  he  said.   As  far  as  proselytising  was  con  cerned,  “Jews  are  in  God’s  Covenant  already,  and  there  is  no  need  to  evan  gelise  them,”  he  said. ",2003-08-15

"  Festival  with  a  message   Activity  to  bring  community  together   ?  BY  LEILA  WILLIAMS  WT   Deloraine  became  a  hive  of  activity  on  Easter  Saturday  with  a  festival  helping  the  Christian  Church  and  Fusion  Australia  reconnect  the  community.   Everyone  was  invited  to  enjoy  the  fun  with  Thomas  the  Tank  Engine  rides,  a  wind  tunnel,  face  painting,  story  telling  and  much  more  all  showing  that  Easter  celebrations  bring  people  together.

""Activities  like  the  stilts  helped  people  overcome  fears,""  regional  support  development  worker  for  Fusion  Australia,  Rohan  Prowse,  said.  ""Watching  individuals  go  from  'no  way  I  can't  do  that'  to  'yay,  I   can  do  it'  just  showed  how  we  can  help  others  move  beyond  limi  tations  and  push  forward.  ""In  general  I  believe  that  Australians  are  down-to-earth,  practical  people  who  look  at  things  saying  either  it  works  or  it  doesn't.  ""What  we  do  helps  people  to  see  who  they  really'  are,""  Mr  Prowse  said.  The  marches  and  festivals   throughout  the  country  used  symbols  to  explain  and  demon  strate  what  living  in  Australia  means.

"  BELFAST’S  ONLY  CHASSIDIC  JEW   ANDREW  MORRIS   BELFAST-There  is  a  new  religious  leader  in  Northern  Ireland's  capital,  a  city  long   divided  by  a  Protestant-Catholic  rift.  But   he’s  not  Christian.   Avraham  Citron,  a  26-year-old  Lubavitch  rabbi  from  Los  Angeles,  is  the  only  Jewish  clergyman  in  all  of  Northern  Ireland,  also  called  Ulster.  In  the  last  few  months,  he  has  become  Ulster's  unofficial  chief  rabbi.   “It's  a  heavy-sounding  title,”  Rabbi  Citron  says,  ""but  yes,  I  guess  I'm  the  only  one.”  In  a  community  that  every  year  sees  dwindling  membership  at  the  city’s  sole  synagogue,  Rabbi  Citron  is  the  first  full-time  rabbi  in  town  in  a  long  time.   Before  Rabbi  Citron’s  promotion  -  he  worked  in  Belfast  for  six  months  on  a  part-time  basis  before  his  appointment  the  community’s  spiritual  needs  were  met  by  a  lay  leader.  But  Jewish  community  enthusiasm  and  numbers  were  waning.   An  estimated  80  per  cent  of  the  Jewish  community  here  is  elderly.  Rabbi  Citron’s  appointment  was  a  “shot  in  the  arm  for  the  community”,  says  Cyril  Rosenbeig,  a  local  businessman  who  leads  tours  of  Belfast’s  synagogue  for  local  church  and  school  geups.  “We  hope  he  can  get  the  young  people  involved  and  deliver  the  Yiddishkeit  goods.”   Nobody,  especially  Belfast’s  rabbi,  has  ary  illusions  that  this  once-large  British  Jewish  community  can  ever  compete  with  England.  But  many  hope   that  this  community,  which  has  dwindled  '  to  600  people  from  a  peak  of  16,000  in  the  1960s,  can  revitalise  itself.   Chabad  rabbis  do  revitalisation  and  outreach  work  in  far-flung  Jewish  communities  all  over  the  world.  “Is  there  a  future  for  Belfast’s  Jews?  I  certainly  think  there  can  be,”  Rabbi  Citron  says  enthusiastically.  “I  think  people  are  definitely  open  to  having  a  thriving,  well-organised  community.  Even  those   people  we  never  see  in  shul  seem  quite  ..  receptive  to  coming  to  the  rabbi’s  house   for  dinner?   Getting  Ulster's  Jews  into  the  synagogue  is  something  the  rabbi  says  he  will  have  to  work  on:  the  average  turnout  for  Saturday  services  is  30.   But  there  are  signs  that  some  younger  Jews  are  taking  an  interest  in  Judaism.  So  far,  10  children  are  enrolled  in  the  synagogue’s  Sunday  school,  and  Rabbi  Citron  is  planning  to  add  another  class,  bringing  the  student  total  to  15.   ""It’s  a  small  but  important  step  forward,”  Rabbi  Citron  says.  He  and  his  wife  Devorah  have  two  young  children.   The  synagogue’s  chief  caretaker,  Adrian  Levy,  describes  the  city’s  lone  synagogue  as  an  “umbrella  community”,  though  it  is  under  the  banner  of  the  United  Synagogue,  an  Orthodox  group.   “Our  services  are  modem  Orthodox,  but  we're  definitely  inclusive  in  our  outlook,”  Levy  says.   Belfast’s  only  Chassidic  Jew  says  he  •  feels  safe.  “I’ve  never  had  any  troubles  walking  around,”  Rabbi  Citron  says.  “Of  course,  people  who  see  me  often  stop  and  stare,  but  I’m  sure  this  is  mere  curiosity  rather  than  antisemitism.  After  all,  nobody  looks  like  the  rabbi.""   JTA ",2003-06-27

"  The  blonde  heroine  of  the  Warsaw  Ghetto   Cesh,a  Glazer,  who  survived  the  war  by  passing  herself  off  as  a  Christian,  saved  six  Warsaw  Jews.  DIONNE  MOSKOW  reports.   CESHA  Glazer  spent  much  of  her  early  adulthood  living  a  life  of   pretence.   With  typical  Aryan  features  -  blonde  hair,  fair  skin  and  a  perfecdy  shaped  head  -  the  18  year  old  acquired  papers  to  pass  herself  off  as  a  Christian,  and  bravely  hid  six  Jews  for  18  months  in  an  alcove  inside  her  apartment  on  the  outskirts  of  the   Warsaw  Ghetto.   Cesha  Glazer’s  fifth-floor  apartment   where  she  hid  six  Jews  (marked  ""X”).   Living  inside  the  Warsaw  Ghetto  between  October  1940  and  late  1941,  she  soon  decided  she  had  to  leave.   “I  decided  much  earlier  but  I  couldn’t  convince  my  parents  to  allow  me  to  get  out  of  the  ghetto  because  it  was  quite  dangerous.  I  knew  some  people  in  the  ghetto  who  needed  con  tacts  on  the  Christian  side,  and  they  were  in  a  position  to  pay  so  I  went  out  and  made  contact  with  them.”   In  1942  Cesha  slipped  back  into  the  ghetto  to  spend  Pesach  with  her  family.  That  was  the  last  time  she  saw  them.  She  later  found  out  they  were  deported  to  Treblinka.   “When  I  found  out  my  parents  were  taken  away  I  had  to  put  on  a  front  and  seem  like  nothing  had  happened,”  she  recalls.   Living  outside  the  ghetto  with  two  women  who  played  the  role  of  her  gentile  “aunts”,  Cesha  was  unaware  of  plans  for  an  uprising.  Her  only  means  of  information  about  the  uprising  came  from  underground  Polish   newspapers.   “When  the  uprising  started  we  could  hear  the  fighting  and  the  noises,  and  smell  the  fire,  especially  at  night-time.  I  felt  hopeless  watching   the  smoke,”  Cesha  recalls.   Six  months  after  the  uprising,  Cesha  met  a  group  of  prisoners  who  were  brought  from  Auschwitz  to  raze  the  ghetto.  Of  the  prisoners,  Max  Mannheimer,  found  a  diary  of  a  young  girl  and  gave  it  to  Cesha  for  safekeeping.   “There  were  a  few  pages  describ  ing  what  was  happening  during  the  uprising.  Jews  were  running  into  bunkers  and  the  Germans  followed  -  and  that’s  where  the  diary  ends.”   “When  I  found  out  my  parents  were  taken   away  I  had  to  put  on  a  front  and  seem  like   nothing  had  happened.”   CESHA  GLAZER  Survivor  of  the  Warsaw  Ghetto   Taking  a  risk,  she  smuggled  out  the  six  Jews  she  was  hiding  so  they  could  view  the  razing  of  the  ghetto  from  the  rooftop  of  her  fifth-floor  apartment.   “There  was  a  merry-go-round  there  [at  Krasinskich  Square]  and  gay  music  was  playing.  People  looked  and  looked.  Some  people  cried  and  were  upset  and  some  were  just  pleased  that  the  Germans  were  getting  rid  of  the   Cesha  Glazer  in  1943  in  Warsaw  (above  left)  and  today  in  Sydney.  She  wore  a  cross  during  the  war  to  pass  herself  off  as  a  Christian.   Jews.  I  couldn’t  react,  I  just  watched.  You  can  imagine  how  I  felt,”  says  Cesha.   After  the  ghetto  had  been  razed,  she  wandered  through  the  rubble,  stumbling  onto  the  street  where  her  aunt  used  to  live.  “I  was  curious.  There  was  no  furniture  left,  all  possessions  were  taken  away,  but  there  were  a  lot  of  papers  and  family  photos  all  over  the  floor.  I  saw  a  photo  of  my  grandmother  and  I  couldn’t  pick  it  up  because  there  were  other  people  around.  Why  should  I,  a  Christian  girl,  need  to  pick  up  a  photo  of  an  old  Jewess?”  she  reminisces.   Now  aged  80,  Cesha  has  no  photographs  of  her  family  -  only   memories.   Reflecting  on  the  uprising,  she  knew  “the  Jews  had  no  chance  of  winning”.   “But  still  they  decided  to  fight.  It  was  just  a  gesture  from  them  not  to  go  like  lambs  to  the  slaughter,  and  to  inflict  some  harm  on  the  Germans.  It  was  a  stand  to  die  with  dignity.”   Cesha  moved  to  Sydney  in  1958  with  her  husband  Mietek,  their  two  daughters,  Monika  and  Diana,  and   Meitek’s  mother,  Roza.   In  1998,  Max  Mannheimer  found  out  that  Cesha  had  survived  the  Holocaust,  eventually  tracking  her  down  at  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  where  she  works  on  Sundays.   A  year  later  Cesha  and  Max  reunited  in  Warsaw  where  they  visited  Cesha’s  apartment  and  the  place  where  they  met.   Their  journeys  were  documented  in  a  short  non-fiction  film  called  The  Blonde  Heroine  of  the  Ghetto,  which   was  screened  on  SBS.   HH ",2003-04-25
"  It's  a  gas  for  HMAS  Newcastle  in  Gulf   By  LCDR  Romina  Barnes   HMAS  Newcastle  (CAPT  Gerry  Christian)  is  half  way  through  her  operations  in  the  Northern  Persian  Gulf  as  part  of  Operation  Catalyst  -  the   Australian  whole  of  Government  effort  to  assist  with  the  rehabilitation  of  Iraq.  Well  into  her  third  patrol,  Newcastle  continues  to  provide  protection  to  the  Gas  Oil  Platforms  (GOPLATS),  and  is  provid  ing  maritime  security  by  regulating  traffic  from  Khor  A1  Arab  (KAA)  and  Shat  A1  Arab  (SAA).  These  are  the  two  main  navigable  waterways  leading  to  ports  in  Iraq.  Umm  Qasr  is  the  only  controlled  commercial  port  open  for  operations  and  is  located  in  the  KAA.  There  are  no  authorised  ports  in  the  SAA  so  all  vessels  carrying  oil  from  there  are  considered  illegal  and  detained  by  the  coalition.  So  far,  Newcastle's  team  has  been  kept  very  busy  with  254  vessel  queries,  over  200  boardings  and  7  escorts.  Forty-four  health  and  comfort  checks  of  detained  vessels  have  also  been  conducted  since  coming  on  station  in  early  August.  It  hasn't  been  all  work  for  the  crew  though.  They  were  recently  able  to  spend   six  days  in  a  Gulf  port  for  much  needed  and  well  deserved  rest  and  recreation.  During  the  visit,  Newcastle  co-hosted  a  cocktail  party  with  the  local  Defence  Attache,  which  was  well  attended  by  local  and  coalition  military  personnel  as  well  as  other  local  dignitaries.  The  event  was  a  great  success  and  showcased  the  RAN's  professionalism  and  Newcastle's  achieve  ments  to  date.  Three,  of  the  female  officers  also  had  the  opportunity  to  experience  some  unique  local  culture  during  a  visit  to  a  Women's  College.  This  college  offers  post-secondary  education  to  local  women,  mainly  in  the  areas  of  Information  Technology  and  Media  Courses.  The  officers  were  given  a  guided  tour  of  the  college  grounds  and  had  the  opportunity  to  visit  several  classes  for  question  time  with  the  students.  Most  were  interested  in  the  kind  of  jobs  women  do  in  the  Australian  Navy  and  whether  females  received  equal  pay  to  the  men.  The  port  visit  also  offered  an  opportu  nity  for  the  crew  to  play  sport  with  beach  volleyball,  rugby  and  golf  being  contested  during  the  six  days.

"  Ridin'  shotgun  in  the  Gulf   By  LCDR  Simon  Bateman  &amp;  Graham  Davis   The  war  in  Iraq  might  be  over  but  the  workload  for  Australia's  maritime  contri  bution  to  the  Coalition,  HMAS  Newcastle  (CAPT  Gerry  Christian),  has  certainly  not   waned.  In  her  first  21  -day  patrol  in  The  Gulf  her  ship's  company  did  99  boardings.  Two  factors  arc  creating  the  tempo  -  a  decision  by  tradition  al  oil  smuggling  cartels  to  restart  operations  and  the  need  for  Coalition  warships  to  protect  Iraq's  only  offshore  oil  loading  terminal,  Mina  ,  A1  Bakh  (MABOT)  -  a  facility  through  which  a  third  of  the  country's  legal  oil  exports  flow.  The  work  being  done  by  Newcastle  is  very  similar  to  pre-war  activity  forming  part  of  the  Coalition  effort  to  enforce  maritime  security  in  Iraqi  territorial  waters,  one  of  the  main  aims  of  Op  Catalyst.  This  enforcement  includes  the  boarding  of  all  vessels  that  enter  and  depart  Iraqi  ports  to  ensure  that  no  illegal  cargo  is  being  carried  in  contravention  of  United  Nations  Resolution  1483.  Another  important  facet  of  the  operation  is   the  provision  of  a  visible  security  presence  in  the  vicinity  of  the  oil  terminal  MABOT.  .  With  the  regular  disruptions  to  the  oil  pipe  lines  in  the  north  this  terminal  holds  significant  strategic  value.  The  emergence  of  normality  in  Iraq  has  seen  an  age-old  problem  rear  its  head,  that  of  illegal  oil  exports.  With  the  re-opening  of  the  Shat-Al-Arab  waterway,  small  tankers  and  cargo  dhows  are  embarking  oil  in  the  port  of  Abu  Flus  and  tak  ing  it  to  the  UAE  where  it  is  sold  at  a  profit.  This  trade  is  having  a  detrimental  effect  on  the  economy  iri  southern  Iraq  where  one  of  the  main  sources  of  frustration  is  the  lack  of  power  and  oil.  '  In  the  heat  and  humidity  of  a  Persian  Gulf  summer,  boarding  operations  are  very  arduous  for  all,  from  the  boarding  parties  to  command.  The  difficulties  often  start  with  the  initial  interrogation  of  a  vessel.  This  is  generally  done  on  a  congested  VHF  channel  in  broken  English.  .  .The  operation  continues  with  often-long  distances  travelled  by  Newcastle's  boarding  party  as  they  seek  out  their  target  vessel.   They  then  have  to  deal  with  a  Master  who  is  very  cagey  and  intent  in  getting  his  perhaps  illegal  cargo  through.  Based  on  the  boarding  officer's  recommen  dation  a  hard  decision  then  has  to  be  made  by  Command  as  to  whether  to  clear  or  detain  the  vessel.  If  the  decision  is  to  detain,  the  vessel  will-  be  directed  to  a  holding  area  to  be  processed.  As  it  may  be  in  that  area  for  a  number  of  days,  the  Coalition  vessels  then  have  the  responsibility  to  conduct  health  and  com  fort  checks  on  the  vessel  to  ensure  the  crew  remains  well.  All  these  activities  make  for  a  busy  and  long  day  in  The  Gulf.  Newcastle  has  performed  admirably  during  her  first  patrol.  Recently  she  hosted  CAPT  J  Peterson  USN,  the  officer  responsible  for  all  Maritime  Interdiction  Operations  in  the  northern  Gulf.  He  said  Newcastle's  performance  thus  far  had  been  outstanding.  During  his  time  in  Newcastle,  he  picked  up  some  cricket  terms  and  remarked  despite  being  99  not  out,  Newcastle  has  certainly  improved  the  average.

They  will  snap  on  my  arse!',  AND  2.  What  are  these  soggy  little  sachets  of  sweet  milk  labelled  Magnum  doing  on  the  shelf?'  At  this  point,  parade  triumphantly  out  of  the  store,  crying,  'Merry  Christmas!  I  don't  care!'  *TIP:  Because  convenience  store  owners  are  of  Middle  Eastern  extraction,  you  may  wish  to  employ  the  story-telling  techniques  of  Scheherezade  from  1001  Arabian  Nights  to  string  them  along  unwittingly.  Activity  2:  LieDog™  Why  not  take  a  Christmas  Eve  stroll  around  the  streets  of  your  local  area?  Strolls  provide  marvellous  opportunities  to  demonstrate  how  little  you  care,  such  as  this  activity  which  is  called  LieDog™.  Wander  with  a  cheerful  demeanour  through  the  tranquil  avenues  of  your  town  or  suburb,  until  you  encounter  somebody  out  walking  their  dog.  Offer  this  person  a  merry  greeting.  Then,  just  as  they  are  in  mid-reply,  quickly  launch  yourself  at  their  dog  and  LIE  DOWN  ON  IT.  Yes,  that's  it,  simply  lie  face  down  on  the  person's  dog,  squashing  the  animal  onto  the  ground.  And  do  not  move.  Now  relax  and  enjoy  the  dog-  owner's  bewilderment  and  alarm  as  they  first  demand  you  get  up  and  then  after  some  moments  of  panic  try  to  drag  their  pet  out  from  under  you  using  the  leash.  It's  very  satisfying  to  declare  ""I  don't  care!"",  as  the  hapless  walker  calls  in  vain  for  assistance  from  equally  alarmed  passers-by.  TIP:  You  might  imagine  that  for  this  activity  to  succeed,  it  is  vastly  if  not  infinitely  preferable  to  select  a  SMALL  dog  rather  than  a  LARGE.  However,  even  lying  down  on  a  great  big  doughy  Labrador  who  shrugs  you  off  and  leaves  you  sprawled  on  the  grass  can  be  an  excellent  proof  to  the  world  of  HOW  LITTLE  YOU  CARE.   Due  to  their  compact  size,  babies  fit  easily  into  most  car  boots   Activity  3:  BabySeek™  This  is  a  wonderful  way  of  NOT  CARING  ABOUT  CHRISTMAS  in  front  of  ALL  YOUR  FRIENDS.  This  activity  requires  a  dinner  party  -  ideally  a  Christmas  dinner  -  with  as  many  people  as  possible  in  attendance.  The  more  people,  the  greater  the  shamefulness  your  tasteless  behaviour  will  produce.  Make  sure  that  at  least  one  of  the  guests  has  brought  their  BABY  to  the  party,  and  has  popped  it  away  sleeping  and  cooing  cutely  in  a  quiet  room  elsewhere  in  the  house.  (Obviously  for  this  condition  to  be  met,  your  group  of  friends  needs  to  be  in  the  25-40  age  group,  or  12-16  if  they  come  from  a  poor  area.)  At  an  appropriate  moment  in  the  evening,  slip  away  with  your  YULETIDE  STEALTH  to  the  room  with  the  baby.  Gently  grab  the  baby,  and  HIDE  IT  IN  THE  BOOT  OF  YOUR  CAR.  Return  to  the  table,  and  very  casually  ask,  ""Where  did  Sam  go?""*  ""What  do  you  mean?""  Sam's  mother  will  ask.  ""Well  his  pram's  empty,""  you  should  tell  her,  again  very  casually.  ""Did  you  move  him?""  she'll  ask   her  husband.  ""No,""  he'll  say.  Then  the  mother  will  get  up  and  go  to  see  if  baby  Sam  is  alright.  Naturally,  she'll  discover  he's  not  alright  at  all,  because  he's  not  there.  At  this  point,  sit  back  and  enjoy  the  gradually  rising  level  of  consternation  as  Sam's  parents  and  then  your  other  friends  search  the  house  for  the  missing  infant.  Soon  the  mood  of  the  party  will  escalate  into  panic,  and  within  twenty  minutes,  hysterical  horror.  The  great  thing  is  -  YOU  DON'T  CARE!  As  the  dinner  guests  ransack  the  house  and  the  men  move  out  into  the  yard  with  torches,  you  may  wish  to  lighten  the  proceedings  with  ironic  witticisms  such  as  ""It's  Christmas,  but  the  baby's  not  in  the  manger!""  Inevitably,  some  responsible  person  will  at  some  stage  decide  to  ring  the  police.  Immediately  before  they  do  so,  fetch  the  baby  from  your  car,  clutch  it  to  your  breast,  and  run  in  wailing,  ""Oh  my  God!  I've  found  him!  He's  dead!""  Savour  the  long  moment  of  silence  that  will  greet  this  proclamation,  and  especialIy  the  hilarious  expressions  on  the  faces  of  Sam's  parents.  Then  hand  the  healthy  child  back  to  his  mother,  or  to  the  father  if  she  has  fainted,  and  declare  with  a  hearty  laugh,  ""Not  really,  he's  fine!  I  just  hid  him  in  my  car!""  A  second  moment  of  silence  usually  follows  this  pro-  nouncement.  You  should  break  it  by  saying,  ""Come  on,  it  was  pretty  funny!""  It  is  now  that  you  will  finally   receive  your  friends'  tributes  for  your  efforts  to  amuse  them.  As  the  baby's  father  barrages  your  face  with  blows  of  mad  grief,  simply  quip,  ""Merry  Christmas!  I  don't  care!""  *  TIP:  If  the  baby's  name  is  not  Sam,  you  might  like  to  replace  the  name  'Sam'  with  the  baby's  actual  name  at  this  point.  Otherwise  no  one  will  know  what  you're  talking  about.   Activity  4:  NoCard™  Express  your  LACK  OF  CARING  to  your  family  by  giving  them  Christmas  presents  WITHOUT  CARDS.

"  Newcastle's  mercy  dash   By  Graham  Davis   Three  Royal  Australian  Navy  sailors  from  HMAS  Newcastle  (CAPT  Gerry  Christian),  backed  by  the  rest  of  the  ship's  company,  have  saved  the  lives  of  four  Iraqi  merchant  crewmen  thrown  into  the  sea  when   their  tug  sank  in  the  northern  Persian  Gulf.  ""They  used  their  local  knowledge,  current  and  tidal  flow  calculations,  to  find  them,""  commanding  officer  of  Newcastle,  CAPT  Gerry  Christian  said  when  his  ship  returned  to  Australia  last  week.  Those  involved  in  the  daring  rescue,  conducted  on  a  moonless  night,  in  Seastate  3  (2m  plus  waves)  and  about  35-knot  winds,  were  LSBM  Samuel  Perez,  ABCSO  Luke  Heam  and  SMNBM  Jeremy  Hulstaert.  CAPT  Christian  said  Newcastle  along  with  other  Coalition  vessels  was  patrolling  high  in  the  northern  Persian  Gulf  when  the  US  Coastguard  cutter  Adak  detected  the  Iraqi  tug  Al  Houda  was  sinking  after  being  flooded  by  a  cross-beam  wave.  ""Adak  found,  four  crewmen  from  the  tug  in  a  rubber  raft,""  CAPT  Christian  told  Navy  News.  ""Another  four  were  missing.""  CAPT  Christian  launched  one  of  his  ship's  RHIBs  crewed  by  Perez,  Heam  and  Hulstaert.  The  trio  travelled  more  than  2.5  miles  across  the  darkened  sea,  saw  where  Adak  was  and  where  the  tug  had  gone  down,  and  calculated  where  the  four  missing  men  might  be.  They  were  right.  ""They  were  treading  water  and  covered  in  oil,""  CAPT  Christian  said.  ""They  had  been  in  the  water  an  estimated  20  minutes.""  Meanwhile,  the  USS  Germantown  had  launched  an  11m  RHIB  carrying  a  medic.  The  four  from  the  Adak  and  the  four  from  the  RAN  RHIB  were  transferred  via  that  large  launch  to  Germantown  before  eventually  being  repatriated  to  Umm  Qasr.

Tries  were  scored  by  CPOMT  East,  ABATA  Axiak  and  POPTI  Williams.  Whilst  Newcastle's  team  had  not  played  together   before,  there  was  plenty  of  talent  around  with  three  members  of  the  team  being  RAN  Rugby  Union  players.  The  game  was  played  at  the  Abu  Dhabi  golf  driving  range,  a  40-minutc  bus  ride  away  from  the  ship.  This  did  not  deter  ship's  company,  as  a  vocal  support  team  piled  into  three  buses  to  cheer  on  the  visitors.  The  only  peculiar  side  to  the  game  was  that  the  venue  did  not  have  any  goal  posts,  so  the  match  was  purely  a  try-scoring  affair.

"  Projet  de  loi  et  mesures  pour  la  protection  de  l'enfance   Le  nouveau  projet  de  loi  pour  l'ertfance,  présenté  par  le  ministre  délégué  à  la  Famille,  Christian  Jacob  accorde  une  large  place  à  la  prévention  de  la  maltraitance,  avec  aussi  des  mesures  concernan  t  les  assis  tan  tes  maternelles  et  lefinancement  des  tutelles.  La  mesure  phare  de  ce  texte,  qui  a  ete  adopté  par  le  Conseil  des  ministres,  est  la  création  d'un  Observatoire  national  de  l'enfance  maltraitée,  d'ici  début  2004,  après  le  vote  de  la  loi  qui  définira  son  fonctionnement.  Composé  de  professionnels  de  la  protection  de  l'enfance,  cet  observatoire  sera  intégré  au  groupement  d'intérêt  public  (GIP)  déjà  responsable  du  numéro  vert  119  du  Snatem  (service  national  d'accueil  téléphonique  de  l'enfance  maltraitée),  ""ce  qui  limitera  son  coût  de  fonctionnement"",  a  noté  M.  Jacob.  Au-delà  des  regroupements  et  croisements  de  diverses  statistiques  existantes  concernant  les  enfants  maltraités,  cet  organisme  permettra  d'analyser  les  causes  de  la  maltraitance  pour  mieux  la  prévenir,  avec  des  indications  précieuses  sur  des  phénomènes  comme  la  mort  subite  du  nourrisson,  le  suicide  des  adolescents  ou  les  liens  entre  maltraitance  et  délinquance  des  mineurs.  Le  projet  permettra  associations  de  se  porter  parties  civiles  dans  des  affaires  dont  eiles  étaient  exclues,  car  l'accord  des  parents  était  jusqu'ici  nécessaire.  Une  autre  modification  du  code  pénal  Suite  à  la  page  4   Suite  de  la  page  3  :  permettra  à  la  justice  de  sanctionner  plus  lourdement  les  employeurs  d'enfants  à  la  scolarisation  perturbée.  En  revanche,  le  texte  prévoit  la  suppression  du  dispositif  retirant  les  allocations  familiales  aux  parents  d'enfants  trop  souvent  absents  à  l'école.  Le  ministre  préfère  l'application  d'amendes  (jusqu'à  750  euros)  devant  l'échec  répété  des  contacts  entre  parents  et  école.  Dans  un  autre  volet  du  projet  de  loi  figure  une  mesure  sur  le  statut  des  assistantes  maternelles  pour  élargir  leur  possibilité  d'accueil  de  trois  enfants  actuellement  à  trois  ""temps  plein""  Ce  qui  va  permettre  d'augmenter  potentiellement  l'offre  de  15%,  soit  de  135.000  places  supplémentaires,  pour  les  350.000  assistantes  maternelles  en  activité.

"  Olympic  bomber  steeped  in  antisemitic  ideology   PETER  EPHROSS   NEW  YORK  -  Eric  Rudolph,  the  American  white  supremacist  arrested  last  week  for  four  bombings,  includ  ing  an  attack  at  the  1996  Olympics  in  Atlanta,  was  apparently  motivated  by  an  antisemitic  ideology  known  as  Christian  Identity.  Rudolph,  36,  also  wrote  a  paper  espousing  Holocaust  denial  while  at  school.  Although  it  is  unknown  whether  Rudolph  consid  ers  himself  a  follower  of  the  group,  in  1984  his  family  spent  four  months  at  a  Christian  Identity  camp  in  Missouri  and  the  family  was  friendly  with  Christian  Identity  preachers.  In  addition,  his  belief  system  seems  to  coincide  with  what  Identity  followers  espouse,  according  to  experts  on  US  hate  groups.  Christian  Identity  originated  in  Britain  in  the  1800s,  when  an  ideology  known  as  British  Israelism  developed;  followers  believed  the  British  descended  from  the  ancient  Israelites.   But  only  when  Christian  Identity  migrated  to  North  America  at  the  end  of  the  19th  and  in  the  early  20th  centuries  did  the  ideology  take  on  antisemitic  and  racist  overtones.   Adherents  believe  non-Jewish  “white  Europeans  and  their  descen  dants  elsewhere  are  descended  from  the  lost  tribes  of  Israel.  Therefore,   they’re  God’s  chosen  people,”  said  Mark  Pitcavage  of  the  Anti-Defama  tion  League.  Others,  including  Jews,  Asians  and  blacks,  were  therefore   deemed  inferior  and  sinister.   There  are  25,000-50,000  Christian  Identity  followers  in  North  America.  They  include  members  of  the  Aryan  Nations,  whose  leader,  Richard  Butler,  ran  a  20-acre  compound  in  Idaho  until  it  was  taken  away  from  the  group  after  a  1998  incident  in  which  a  teenager  and  his  mother  were  beaten.  Buford  Furrow,  serving  a  life  sentence  for  killing  a  Filipino  American  post  man  and  wounding  five  people  at  a  Jewish  centre  in  a  1999  shooting  spree  in  Los  Angeles,  was  a  member  of  the  Aryan  Nations.  Some  theologically  inclined  Christian  Identity  followers  believe  Jews  descended  from  a  union  between  Eve  and  the  biblical  serpent  which  they  say  created  Cain.   For  Christian  Identity   followers,  antisemitism  “is  critical”.   HEIDI  BEIRICH  Southern  Poverty  Law  Centre   They  also  believe  that  blacks  and  Asians  -  whom  they  call  “mud  peo  ple”  -  were  created  during  “practice”   creations.  But  for  all  Christian  Identi   ty  followers,  antisemitism  “is  critical  -  that  Jews  are  Satanic  and  need  to  be  eradicated”,  said  Heidi  Beirich  of  the  Southern  Poverty  Law  Centre,  a  watchdog  group.  Rudolph  was  arrest  ed  in  North  Carolina  last  week  after  a   five-year  search.  He  is  believed  to  be  responsible  for  four  bombings  in  which  two  people  were  killed  and  150  injured.   He  has  been  transferred  to   Alabama  to  face  charges  for  a  1998  bombing  at  an  abortion  clinic  in  Birmingham  in  which  a  policeman  was  killed.  He  also  allegedly  bombed  a  gay  nightclub  and  a  building  housing  another  abortion  clinic.   But  Jews  came  in  for  particular  hatred,  said  his  former  sister-in-law.  Rudolph  “hated  Jews  more  than  probably  any  other  race”,  Deborah  Rudolph,  who  is  divorced  from  Rudolph’s  brother,  Joel,  told  ABC’s  Good  Morning  America.   He  “felt  that  they’ve  been  run  out  of  every  country  they’ve  been  in.  They’ve  destroyed  every  country  they’ve  been  in.  They  have  too  much  control  in  our  country.”   He  considered  television  “the  electronic  Jew”,  she  said  in  another  interview.  “You  could  be  watching  a  sitcom  and  the  credits  would  roll  and  there’d  be  Jewish  names  and  he  would  say  ‘You  f***ing  Yids.’  Any  little  thing   and  he  would  start.”   Rudolph’s  introduction  to  white  supremacism  seems  to  have  started  in  1981,  after  his  father  died  in  South  Florida  from  cancer.  At  school,  Eric  wrote  the  paper  denying  the  Holocaust.  “Eric’s  paper  saying  the  Holocaust  never  happened  -  this  was  Eric’s  and  the  whole  family’s  deal,”  Deborah  Rudolph  said.

"  Compassion  not  enough  -  O’Shea   DEBBIE  SELIKMAN   Paul  O’Shea   IT  is  not  enough  to  feel  compassion  for  the  Jews  over  the  Holocaust,  Catholic  educator  Paul  O’Shea  told  a  Holocaust  memorial  service  at  St   Mary’s  Cathedral  last  Thursday.   “It  is  not  enough  just  to  sentimen  talise  with  the  Jews  of  the  Holocaust;  our  implication  must  be  recognised  in  Christian  thought,”  he  said.   An  initiative  of  the  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews,  the  service   was  attended  by  members  and  spiri   tual  leaders  of  both  faiths.   Delivering  the  keynote  address,  Holocaust  lecturer  Paul  O’Shea   emphasised  that  the  Holocaust  would  not  have  been  possible  without  Chris  tian  antisemitism  and  anti-Judaic  teachings.   “These  are  shameful  chapters  in  the  Christian  Church’s  past,  and  to  say  otherwise  would  be  simply  to  ignore  history,”  he  said.   “Christians  must  own  their  past;   must  recognise  the  role  they  played  in  establishing  the  circumstances  in  which  the  Holocaust  took  place.”   The  commemoration  service  is  a   way  of  translating  the  errors  of  the  past  into  something  which  demon  strates  the  repentance  of  the  Church  and  its  growing  acceptance  of  Judaism,  O’Shea  said.   “A  big  problem  within  Christiani  ty  is  that  most  Christians  have  no  contact  with  Jews.  The  CCJ  enables  Christians  and  Jews  to  come  together   in  mutual  respect  to  talk,  debate  and  learn  from  one  another.”   Six  candles  were  lit;  a  poem  from  Warsaw  was  recited  in  Yiddish  by  Chaim  Oppermann;  and  prayers   were  recited.   According  to  CCJ  member  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple,  the  concept  was  originally  a  “spontaneous  wish  on  behalf  of  the  Christian  community  to  express  and  help  resolve  its  feelings  of  guilt  towards  the  Jews  and  the  Holo   caust”.

Cardinal  Walter  Kasper,  presi  dent  of  the  Vatican’s  Commission  for  Religious  Relations  with  Jews,  took  part  in  a  discussion  with   Emeritus  Law  Professor  Louis  Waller  that  broached  the  con  tentious  issue  of  the  Church  dur  ing  the  Holocaust   “We  talked  about  current  rela  tions,  including  the  Church’s  moves  to  effect  reconciliation  with   the  Jews  that  began  with  [Pope]  John  23rd  between  1963  and  1965,”  Professor  Waller  said.   Cardinal  Kasper  “said  the  Church  is  not  trying  to  convert  Jews.  The  Catholic  Church  believes  the  Jewish  people  have  a  special  relationship  with  God.”   Cardinal  Kasper  also  dined  with  Rabbi  John  Levi,  a  founder  of  the  Australian  Council  of  Chris  tians  and  Jews.   Rabbi  Levi  said  “the  visit  was  an  indication  that  the  Vatican   takes  Jewish-Christian  dialogue  very  seriously.  “It  was  not  just  an  accidental  visit,”  he  said. ",2003-08-01
"  Christians,  Jews  unite  in  prayer   JACQUI  GAL   POLITICIANS,  nuns,  rabbis  and  bishops  bowed  their  heads  together  in   commemoration  of  Kristallnacht  at   Sydney  Square  last  week.   In  a  service  led  by  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  president  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Cohen,  participants  were  asked  to  reflect  on  the  events  of  November  9,  1938  -  when  91  Jews  were  killed,  and  synagogues  and  Jew  ish  shopfronts  were  smashed  and  burned  in  the  major  cities  of  Ger  many  and  Austria.   The  day  is  generally  regarded  as  marking  the  beginning  of  the   Holocaust.   Addressing  the  gathering,  Bishop  of  South  Sydney  Robert  Forsyth  remarked:  “It  has  significance  for  Christians  and  Jews  that  such  things  could  happen  in  a  country  that  was,  at  least  in  a  nominal  sense,  Christian.  It  continues  to  be  a  source  of  grief   Rabbi  Jeffrey  Cohen   and  even  repentance   Rabbi  Cohen:  “We  remember  that   night  of  darkness  and  fear  that  swept  Christian  Europe.  We  remember  those  who  were  persecuted:  Jews  for  being  Jews.  We  remember  those  who   Bishop  of  South  Sydney  Robert  Forsyth   spoke  out,  brave  souls  who  tried  to   save  a  world  ”   Rabbi  Jacqueline  Ninio  smashed  a  glass,  Kaddish  was  recited  and  a  sho  far  was  blown  to  end  the  service.

"  I  REFER  to  your  article  Leaders  slam  Greek  Orthodox  Archbish   op”  (AJN  10/01/03),  in  which  caustic  comments  appear  con  cerning  Archbishop  Stylianos’  Christmas  message.   Readers  of  that  article  may  not  have  been  made  aware  that  the  message  in  question  was  commenting  about  Jews  and  Christians  together,  specifically  as  “people  of  the  Bible”.   The  Jewish  and  Christian  faiths  are  the  major  religious  groups  in  Western  society,  and  it   is  in  this  broader  context  that  we  must  honestly  reflect  upon  our  relationship  with,  and  effect  on,  those  who  belong  to  other  major  world  religions.   The  topicality  of  such  con  cern,  given  recent  world  events,  is  obvious.  If  Jewish  and  Christ  ian  people,  who  uniquely  share  the  same  Holy  Scriptures,  can  not  do  this,  then  we  reveal  our  own  inability  to  reflect  and  engage  in  self-criticism.   Following  the  Archbishop’s   mention  of  our  two  faith  groups,  the  question  arises:  which  believer  in  God  (regardless  of  religious  persuasion)  can  truth  fully  claim  to  live  up  perfectly  to  the  proclamation  of  his  or  her   faith?   Dealing  with  this  question  should  not  be  regarded  as  “offensive”,  as  this  was  far  from  the  author’s  intention.

"  Bush’s  choice:  Powell  or  the  prophets   X.   If  Jesus  were  alive  today,  the  US  State   Department  would  likely  criticise  him  for  being  a  Jewish  settler  and  an  obstacle  to  peace.   MICHAEL  FREUND  examines  the  contradictions  between   Christian  religious  texts  and  a  state  called  Palestine.   DID  the  president  really  say   what  I  think  he  said?  Speak  ing  in  the  White  House  Rose  Garden  this  past  Friday,  a  dearly  delighted  Colin  Powell  at  his  side,  George  W  Bush  went  ahead  and  used  the  O  word,  as  in  “occupied”,  when  describing  Israel’s  heartland  of  Judea,  Samaria  and  Gaza.   In  laying  out  his  vision  for  the   establishment  of  a  Palestinian  state,  Bush  said  that,  “as  progress  is  made  toward  peace,  settlement  activity  in  the  occupied  territories  must  end”,  the  implication  being  that  Jewish  housing  construction  somehow  inhibits  Middle  Eastern  harmony.   With  the  United  States  poised  to  liberate  Baghdad,  the  president’s  use  of  the  O  word  might  seem  a  matter  of  secondary  importance,  as  the  entire  region  will  soon  undergo  a  funda   mental  transformation  of  historic   proportions.  America  is  about  to  reshuffle  the  Arab  deck,  with  far  reaching  consequences  for  nearly  every  country  involved.   But  with  all  the  uncertainty  regarding  precisely  what  will  emerge  in  the  post-Saddam  era,  there  is  one  issue  about  which  there  should  be  lit  tle  doubt.  Once  the  Iraqis  get  wal  loped,  Russia,  Europe  and  the  Arab  world  will  seek  to  force  Bush  to  “bal  ance”  his  liberation  of  Iraq  with  inde  pendence  for  the  Palestinians.   Hence,  the  president’s  reference  to  the  “occupied  territories”  is  just  a  small  taste  of  what  is  yet  to  come.   The  White  House’s  stance  on   Judea,  Samaria  and  Gaza  is  hardly  new.  American  presidents  have  long  vocally  opposed  the  expansion  of  Jewish  communities  in  the  territories.   But  Bush  is  not  just  any  American  president.  Unlike  his  predecessors,  he  has  pushed  Yasser  Arafat  into  a  cor  ner,  courageously  stood  up  to  Sad  dam  Hussein,  underlined  the  need  for  democratisation  of  the  Arab  world  and  launched  a  far-reaching  global   war  on  terror.   It  may  sound  cliched,  but  he  is  by  far  “the  best  friend  Israel  has  had  in  the  White  House”  in  a  good  long  time.   And  that  is  what  makes  his  latest  remarks  so  puzzling.   For  as  a  number  of  recent  stories  in  the  US  press  have  made  amply  clear,  Bush  is  a  religious  man  who  takes  his  Christian  faith  seriously.  And  yet,  if  Jesus  were  alive  today,  the  US  State  Department  would  likely  criticise  him  for  being  a  Jewish  settler  and  an  obstacle  to  peace.   After  all,  according  to  the  New  Tes  tament,  Jesus  was  a  Jew  bom  in  Beth  lehem,  in  what  Colin  Powell  considers  the  “occupied  territory”  of  Judea.  His  parents  were  Jews  who  undoubtedly  prayed  at  a  local  Bethlehem  syna  gogue,  learned  Torah  at  a  local  study  hall,  and  bought  food  at  the  local  kosher  marketplace.  Thus  they  were  Jewish  settlers  in  every  respect.   Needless  to  say,  the  New  Testa  ment  itself  contains  no  mention  of  the  word  “Palestine”  or  “Palestinians”,  for  the  simple  reason  that  they  did  not  exist.  All  told,  in  the  Hebrew  Bible  and  the  New  Testament,  the  terms  “Judah”  or  “Judea”  appear  877  times,  and  “Samaria”  is  used  on  123  occa  sions.  There  is  no  reference  to  phrases   Ariel  Sharon  (left)  and  George  W  Bush  In  conference.   Photo:  JTA   such  as  the  “West  Bank”  or  “occupied  territories”;  Islam  had  not  yet  even  come  into  being.   It  is  therefore  hard  to  understand  why  the  president  would  pressure  Israel  to  turn  over  Judea  and  Samaria  to  the  Palestinians,  for  he  would  appear  to  be  acting  contrary  to  what  his  own  hallowed  text  seems  to  demonstrate,   namely,  that  these  areas  belong  to  the  Jewish  people  and  no-one  else.   The  same  goes  for  Israel’s  capital,  where  many  of  the  events  in  the  Christian  Bible,  such  as  the  last  sup  per  on  Mount  Zion,  the  denunciation  in  the  Garden  of  Gethsemane  and  the  crucifixion  on  Golgotha  are  all  described  as  having  taken  place  in  Jerusalem  -  Roman-occupied  Jewish  Jerusalem,  that  is.  Hence,  Christians  who  accept  Palestinian  demands  to  Jerusalem  are  essentially  denying  the  validity  of  their  own  traditions.   It  is  imperative,  then,  that  American  Christian  supporters  of  Israel  launch  an  all-out  effort  to  counter  the  pressure  Bush  is  coming  under  from  the  likes  of  Tony  Blair  and  Colin  Powell.   Since  Bush  is  a  man  of  faith,  Chris  tian  supporters  of  Israel  should  appeal  to  him  using  a  faith-based  approach,  pointing  out  that  the  New  Testament  provides  ample  evidence  that  places   such  as  Bethlehem  and  Hebron  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  Palestinians,  and  everything  to  do  with  Israel.   Of  course  I,  as  a  Jew,  personally  look  to  the  Torah  for  validation  of  my  people’s  unbreakable  connection  to  the  Land  of  Israel  and  exclusive  rights  to  it.  As  far  as  I  am  concerned  the  views  of  the  prophets  take  precedence  over  those  of  Colin  Powell  any  day.   Once  the  war  in  Iraq  is  over,  though,  Bush  will  likely  have  to  make   a  choice  between  the  two.   Now  is  the  time  for  American   Christians  to  speak  out  and  remind  him  that  when  it  comes  to  politics  versus  prophecy,  the  man  of  faith  must  ultimately  follow  his  heart.   Michael  Freund  served  as  deputy  director  of  communications  and  policy  planning  in   the  Prime  Minister’s  Office  from  1996  to  1999  and  is  a  columnist  for  the  Jerusalem   Post,  where  this  article  first  appeared.

"  Hanson  loses  NSW  seat  bid   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   ALTHOUGH  she  personally  attracted  more  first  preference  votes  than  any  of  the  284  can  didates,  former  One  Nation  leader  Pauline  Hanson  failed  to  win  a  seat  in  the  New  South  Wales  Legislative  Council  when  vote  counting  for  the  election  was  finally  completed  last  week.   Hanson  attracted  12,468  individual  first  preference  votes,  compared  with  9792  for  Ian  Cohen  (Greens),  8171  for  Michael  Gallacher  (Liberal/National),  8056  for  Michael  Egan  (Labor)  and  4645  for  Gordon  Moyes  (Christ  ian  Democrats).   But  as  voters  in  the  Upper  House  elections  may  choose  to  vote  for  a  group  of  candidates  rather  than  for  an  individual,  the  number  of  votes  cast  for  a  group  plus  the  distribution  of  preferences  determines  the  result.   Hanson  finished  22nd  in  the  race  for  the  21   Upper  Houses  seats  to  be  filled.  There  are  a   total  of  42  seats  in  the  House.   The  last  seat  went  to  Shooters  Party  incum  bent  John  Tingle,  whose  individual  votes  totalled  only  2622,  but  whose  group  attracted  more  votes  than  Hanson’s,  as  well  as  prefer  ences  from  other  candidates.   Altogether,  17  seats  went  to  the  two  major  parties.  Labor  (including  Tony  Catanzariti,  who  just  scraped  in)  won  10  and  the  Liberal/National  Party  coalition,  seven.

"  Turning  dialogue  into   interfaith  trialogue   AUSTRALIAN  Jewish  leaders  have  participated  in  dialogue  sessions  with  Muslims,  Catholics  and  the  Uniting  Church  in  recent  weeks.   The  exchanges  “confirm  Australia’s  position  as  a  country  where  unique  breadth  of  contact  takes  place  between  Jewish  and  non-Jewish  leadership”,  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  said.   The  Gazi  Husrevbeg  Mosque  in  Penshurst  was  the  venue  for  the  Aus  tralian  National  Dialogue  of  Chris  tians,  Muslims  and  Jews.   Delegates  representing  Australia’s  peak  Jewish,  Muslim  and  Christian   bodies  met  to  discuss  the  Muslim  con   cept  of  jihad  with  a  presentation  by  the  Muslim  representatives.   The  dialogue  was  co-chaired  by  Jones,  who  was  accompanied  by  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Kamins,  Peta  Jones  Pellach,   Melanie  Schwartz  and  Yair  Miller.   In  a  separate  meeting  at  the  mosque,  representatives  of  the  Aus  tralian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils,  National  Council  of  Churches  in  Aus  tralia  and  ECAJ  discussed  reconcilia  tion  between  indigenous  and   non-indigenous  Australians.   A  dialogue  between  the  Uniting  Church  and  the  Jewish  community  at  the  Great  Synagogue  focused  on  when  it  is  religiously  justified  to  engage  in   war.   The  Jewish  representatives  were  Jones,  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple,  Josie  Lacey,  Rabbi  John  Levi,  Rabbi  Jacque  line  Ninio  and  Jones  Pellach.   The  Catholic  Bishops’  Committee  hosted  the  Annual  Conversation  with   ECAJ  representatives  at  St  Mary’s  Cathedral,  where  discussion  again  focused  on  “a  just  war”,  as  well  as  on   antisemitism.

"  AT  A  GLANCE:  Chris  Cuffe's  $33  million  payout   Stupid  or  Greedy?  Greedy?   Many  people  think  Cuffe  is  a  greedy  bastard.  This  is  a  highly  cogent  argument  which  most  people  can  agree  with.  Thus  far  the  only  flaw  found  in  the  argument  is  the  question  ""What  would  you  have  done  if  you'd  been  offered  $33  million?""   Stupid?  Others  think  Cuffe  is  stupid  because  he  could  have  earned  far  more  and  done  it  in  a  way  that  would  have  avoided  the  newspapers.  They  say  he  should  have  taken  shares  in  Colonial  State.  They  say  he  deserved  more  for  building  Colonial  State  into  a  billion  dollar  company.  These  people  tend  to  be  multi-millionaires,  such  as  Gerry  Harvey,  and  other  financial  managers.   David  Murray's  Role  Despite  acting  surprised,  Commonwealth  Bank  CEO  David  Murray  was  actually  thrilled  by  the  payout  to  Cuffe.  This  managed  to  make  the  $7  million  that  Murray  received  from  the  bank  last  year  seem  like  the  award  wage.   Christian  The  media  and  friends  of  Cuffe's  continually  point  out  that  he  is  a  Christian.  It  is  difficult  to  understand  the  relevance  of  this  fact  but  it  seems  to  be  something  like  ""how  can  being  paid  $33  million  be  immoral  if  this  guy  prays  occasionally?""  The  'but  he  is  a  god-fearing  bloke'  argument  has  however  lost  a  lot  of  its  tarnish  over  the  last  few  years  when  the  word  Priest  became  synonymous  with  kiddie-fondler.

They  believe  that  we  shouldn't  envy  the  success  but  rather  seek  to  emulate  it.  This  effect  will  ensure  that  in  the  upcoming  weeks  waiters,  garbage  men  and  cleaners  will  all  be  putting  in  that  extra  20%  in  the  hope  that  they  will  be  offered  a  million  dollar  payment  when  they  chose  to  leave  their  employment.

"  Significance  of  tombstone  ceremony  in  Torres  Strait   Culture  Connection   with  EPHRAIM  Linguist/Historian  BANI   The  term  ""tombstone""  might  present  many  concepts  leading  to,  perhaps,  unearthing  the  remains  from  the  grave  or  probing  into  the  entombment,  but  it  is  neither  of  these  when  one  interprets  it  through  the  cultural  eyes  of  aTorres  Strait  Islander.  In  the  remote  past,  the  practice  of  preparation  of  mortal  remains  through  the  mortuary  rites  were  very  different  to  what  it  is  now  today.  The  rites  had  taken  contemporary  means  but  the  deep  significance  is  still  retained  to  this  day.  The  respect  of  the  funerary  preparations  and  mortuary  rites  are  still  being  observed.  The  mystical  islands  of  Mer,  Erub  and  Ugar  practiced  mummification  of  the  body,  while  the  rest  of  the  Torres  Strait  placed  their  dead  bodies  on  top  of  a  platform  called  sara,  supported  by  four  tall  posts  called  Kag.  The  belief  system  was  embedded  in  the  afterlife  of  a  spiritual  entity  that  must  exit  the  body  shell.  This  cannot  take  place  unless  a  time  portal  is  opened  to  the  other  dimension  through  special  rituals  and  rites  before  the  body  is  buried  in  a  cave.  By  initiating  this,  the  families  of  the  deceased  are  satisfied  that  the  spirit  of  the  dead  had  been  directed  to  the  spirit  world  called  Kibu.  The  spirit  world  in  theTorres  Strait  is  believed  to  be  located  in  the  west  where  the  sun  sets.   During  the  death  a  body  was  treated  in  a  special  manner  for  few  days.  All  ceremonies  are  performed  by  specially  selected  people  who  are  the  in-laws  of  the  departed  person.  These  special  people  are  called  Marigeth.  Marigeth  is  composed  of  two  words  incorporated  into  on.  Mari  =  Spirit:  Geth  =  Hand.  It  can  be  precisely  translated  as  Spirit  hand.  This  is;  The  Spirit  Handler.  Since  the  Marigeth\s  performing  mortuary  rites,  he  is  labeled  as  the  handler  of  the  spirit.  The  person  who  directs  the  spirit  to  enter  into  the  spirit  zone.  During  this  period  the  families  sits  in  mourning  called  Aum  or  Bud.  After  the  period  of  the  sacred  rites  and  the   final  burial  of  the  remains,  this  could  be  approximately  a  week  or  less,  the  mourners  gives  a  thanksgiving  feast  called  Thoerabau  ai  in  honor  of  the  in-laws  the  Marigeth  and  provide  them  with  presents  of  garden  products,  hunting  implements,  things  of  considerable  value.  This  is  in  appreciation  and  gratitude  for  their  care  taking,  for  rituals  and  burial.  When  the  Missionaries  came  in  1871  they  introduced  Christian  burials  and  altered  the  beliefs  to  that  of  Christianity.  However,  this  did  not  altered  the  moral  conduct  of  the  Marigeth  and  the  mourning  practices  but  the  responsibility  of  the  ritual  was  now  taken  over  by  a  missionary.   When  Torres  Strait  was  exposed  to  cash  economy,  the  concept  of  memory  was  awakened  and  the  people  started  to  erect  headstones  as  it  was  introduced  by  the  mission  teachers.  Although  the  spiritual  beliefs  of  Christian  teaching  and  the  cultural  perception  were  parallel  the  Torres  Strait  Islanders  still  retained  the  moral  code  of  the  mortuary  rites  and  the  respect  of  the  in-laws  Marigeth  to  this  day.  They  had  managed  to  express  it  in  contemporary  manner  during  the  Christian  ceremony  of  the  unveiling  of  the  headstone.  Because  not  much  of  this  term  unveiling  of  atombstone  is  used  people  who  are  new  to  Torres  Strait  sometime  imagined  it  in  direct  context  when  they  hear  it  as  the  opening  of  a  tombstone.  Today,  when  atombstone  is  unveiled  it  is  done  by  the  Marigeth  and  the  gifts  laid  on  top  of  the  tombstone  is  really  a  thanksgiving  and  appreciation  presents  to  the  Marigeth.  Today  wherever  you  find  a  Torres  Strait  Islander  the  ceremony  of  a  tombstone  is  always  sacred  and  a  time  for  family  unity  and  joyful  celebration  to  honor  the  new  memorial  monument  unveiled  where  visitors  to  a  cemetery  will  now  be  enlightened  by  the  inscription,  and  the  family  will  always  have  the  memory  of  their  loved  ones  preserved  in  time  for  perpetuity.

"  Tireless  supporter  of  Israel   RUTH  E  GRUBER   ROBERT  St  John,  a  journalist,  author  and  stal  wart  supporter  of  Israel,  died  near  Washington  at  the  age  of  100.   During  a  75-year  career  in  which  he  worked  on  five  continents,  St  John  chronicled  World  War  II  and  befriended  Israel's  founding  fathers.   An  eloquent  non-Jewish  spokesman  for  Jewish  causes,  he  maintained  close  ties  with  the  Jewish  State  and  was  honoured  by  Jewish  and  Israeli  institutions.   David  Ben-Gurion,  Israel's  first  prime  minis  ter,  called  him  ""our  goyisher  Zionist"".   His  first  book,  From  the  Land  of  Silent  People,  recounted  the  Nazi  conquest  of  Yugoslavia  and  his  own  harrowing  escape  through  the  Balkans  after  the  fall  of  Belgrade.   The  persecution  of  Jews  that  St  John  wit  nessed  during  World  War  II  helped  instil  in  him  a  deep  and  enduring  interest  in  Israel,  Jewish   issues  and  antisemitism.   Covering  the  January  1941  pogrom  in  Bucharest,  when  Romanian  fascists  tortured  and  killed  about  170  Jews,  marked  a  water  shed  for  him.   ""I  promised  myself  that  if  I  lived  out  the  war,  I'd  spend  the  rest  of  my  life  trying  to  atone  for  these  sins,  for  the  atrocities  commit  ted  in  Bucharest  by  men  born  Christian  and  presumably  exposed  to  Christian  precepts  they  had  so  barbarically  violated,""  St  John,  who  had  sheltered  a  Jewish  family  to  save  them  from  the  massacre,  recalled  later.   St  John  covered  the  Eichmann  trial  and  five   0B8TUARY   Robert  St  John   Arab-lsraeli  wars,  including  the  1982  Israeli  invasion  of  Lebanon;  at  the  time  he  was  80,  by  far  the  oldest  of  the  hundreds  of  reporters  on  hand,  and  the  only  one  who  had  covered  all  four  previous  Arab-lsraeli  conflicts.   Many  of  St  John's  22  books  were  on  Jewish  or  Israeli  topics.  They  included  Shalom  Means  Peace,  about  the  birth  of  Israel,  and  biogra  phies  of  Ben-Gurion,  Israeli  statesman  Abba  Eban,  and  Egypt's  Gamal  Abdul  Nasser,  as  well  as  books  on  American  Jewish  history,  the  Jordan  River  and  the  resurrection  of  Hebrew  as  a  spoken  language.

"  Positive  images   THE  book  review  of  The  First  Fagin  by  Rabbi  John  Levi  mentioned  Dicken’s  anagram  of  the  Yiddish  ganif  to  gen  erate  the  name  Fagin.   Although  Fagin,  as  Rabbi  Levi  states,  can  be  seen  as  carrying  on  the  myth  of  the  villainous  Jew,  seducing  innocent  Christian  children,  Dickens  had  other  and  much  more  positive  portrayals  of  Jews  in  his  other  novels.

"  Mount  Druitt  meets  the  rabbi   JACQUI  GAL   STUDENTS  at  an  Islamic  school  in  Mount  Druitt  recently  beheld  a  sight  they  had  never  seen  before  -  a  Lubav   itch  rabbi.   The  students,  at  King  Abdul  Aziz  High  School,  were  given  free  reign  to  pose  questions  to  a  Jew,  a  Christian  and  a  Muslim.   Many  were  openly  intrigued  by  Rabbi  Kastel,  who  was  the  target  of  most  of  the  questions.   “What  are  those  strings?”  asked  a  student,  indicating  his  tzitzit.   “Does  your  holy  book  say  what  happens  when  you  die?”   “Is  drinking  allowed  in  your  reli  gion?”   “Do  any  people  know  your  holy  book  by  heart?”   “What  God  do  you  believe  in?”   To  which  Rabbi  Kastel  smiled;  ""We  have  a  God  that  created  the  world,  that  still  exists  and  that  you  can’t  see.   Sound  familiar?”   Nods  of  recognition  rippled  through  the  audience  of  boys  on  one  side  of  the  classroom  and  girls  on  the  other,  the  latters’  heads  covered  with  hijabs  (traditional  scarves).   A  project  of  North  Shore  Chabad  House,  the  Goodness  and  Kindness  campaign  was  conceived  by  Rabbi  Kastel  and  Catholic  theology  student  Joe  Sheridan  after  Sheridan  contacted  the  rabbi  one  night  last  year.   “I  received  a  call  just  as  I  was  get   Seyfi  Seyit  (back  left)  and  Rabbi  Zaiman  Kastel  (centre)  with  students  at  King  Abdul  Aziz  High  School,  Mount  Druitt   ting  ready  to  leave  the  office,”  Rabbi  Kastel  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.  “I  thought  I’d  get  rid  of  the  per  son  in  five  minutes,  but  after  an  hour  and-a-half  we  were  still  talking.   “Joe  was  concerned  that  people  had  stopped  acting  on  the  values  and  beliefs  they  learn  from  religion.”   Devising  the  campaign,  the  pair  enlisted  Seyfi  Seyit  from  the  Federa  tion  of  Islamic  Councils.  The  trio   have  taken  their  ""road  show”  to  20  schools  throughout  Sydney.   Since  gaining  NSW  Government  accreditation,  demand  for  the  pro  gram  has  escalated,  with  about  100  schools  requesting  that  it  be  conduct  ed  within  the  next  year.   While  the  program  draws  atten   tion  to  similarities  and  differences  in   the  three  monotheistic  religions,  it  incorporates  interactive  activities  to   promote  harmony  and  positive   behaviour.   Students  are  also  urged  to  commit  to  doing  acts  of  kindness  and  to  con  tribute  a  decorated  patch  for  a  large  quilt.   The  trio  plan  to  train  other  repre  sentatives  to  help  accommodate  the  demand.  Ray  Corbin  was  the  Christ  ian  representative  at  King  Abdul  Aziz  College. ",2003-08-29

"  Outlook   \  \   a*   BELFAST’S  ONLY  CHASSIDIC  JEW   ANDREW  MORRIS   P   DCI  CACT  Thom  ic  o  nnur  raiirfim  10  loarl/ar   Northern  Ireland's  small   Jewish  community  walks   a  fine  line  in  the  sectarian  conflict  between  Catholics  and  Protestants,  writes   ANDREW  IVIORRIS  from  Belfast.   1  The  incongruity  of  the   blue-and-white  Israeli   flag  flying  alongside  the  Union  Jack  and  the   green  of  the  Palestinian   I  flag  flying  alongside  the   Irish  Tricolour  has  some  Belfast  Jews  somewhat  bemused.   Belfast’s  Rabbi  Avraham  Citron  and  ms  wife  Devorah.   THERE’S  an  old  joke  told  in   Northern  Ireland  about  a   guy  in  Belfast  who  is  stopped  by  a  ruffian  and  asked  his  religion.  Wanting  to  avoid  trouble  all  around,  he  responds,  “I’m  Jewish.”   Without  missing  a  beat,  the  ruffian  says:  “Fine.  A  Catholic  Jew  or  a  Protestant  Jew?”   Rarely  do  punchlines  highlight   such  truths.  Northern  Ireland  is  a   deeply  religious  country,  a  rarity  in  Western  Europe.  In  this  nation  your  church  defines  you,  even  if  your  church  happens  to  be  a  synagogue,  mosque  or  Buddhist  temple.   With  much  of  the  coverage  of  Ulster,  as  Northern  Ireland  is  traditionally  called,  focused  on  the  sectarian  conflict  between  the  largely  pro-London  Protestants  and  the  mainly  pro-Dublin  Catholics,  few   consider  the  conflict’s  effects  on  members  of  the  other  religions  and  ethnic  groups  who  live  here.   For  Ulster’s  Jews,  good  relations  with  the  majority  Protestant  and  minority  Catholic  communities  are  a  high  priority.   “They  both  think  we’re  more  like  them  then  the  other  side,”  says  Shoshana  Appleton,  an  Israeli-born  community  member  and  inter-faith  activist  who  is  married  to  the   president  of  Northern  Ireland’s  Jewish  community.   “The  Catholics  say  you  are  an  old  religion  like  us,  and  the  Protestants  say  you’ve  got  rid  of  all  that  Catholic  confessional  dogma  and  are  similar  to  us,”  she  says.   But  when,  as  in  Northern  Ireland,  you’re  “either  with  us  or  against  us”,  the  Jewish  community  can  find  itself  in  an  awkward  predicament.   “We  have  always  taken  the  position  that  we  have  no  position,”  explains  Ronnie  Appleton,  who,  along  with  his  presidential  post,  is  vice-president  of  the  local  branch  of  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews.   Recendy  retired  as  Northern  Ireland’s  chief  grand  prosecutor,  Appleton  knows  the  importance  of  maintaining  an  air  of  impartiality.   In  the  Jewish  community,  he  says,  “Individuals  can  say  what  they  like  about  who  they  support,  but  certainly  not  on  behalf  of  the  community.”   As  the  province’s  oldest  non-Christian  religious  group,  the  Jews  have  been  waiting  a  long  time  for  the  sectarian  conflict  to  end.   Jews  have  been  in  Ulster  since  the  17th  century.  Mainly  concentrated  in  north  Belfast,  they  built  their  first  synagogue  here  in  the  1860s.   Despite  its  modest  size,  the  Jewish  community  is  held  in  high  regard.  Among  its  members  have  been  such  illustrious  figures  as  the  ex-lord  mayor  of  Belfast,  Sir  Otto  Jafife,  and  the  sixth  president  of  Israel,  Chaim  Herzog.   At  its  height,  in  the  1960s,  the  Jewish  community  was  16,000  strong.  Since  then,  most  Jews  have  immigrated  to  mainland  Britain,  America  or  Israel,  largely  due  to  the  “troubles”  -  the  euphemism  here  for   Loyalist  murals  on  a  building  In  the  “badlands”  of  Belfast   Photo:  Andrew  Morris   Irish  sectarian  strife.  Today  an  esti  mated  600  Jews  live  in  Ulster,  160  of  whom  are  members  of  the  communi  ty’s  only  synagogue.   The  community’s  official  position  on  the  long-running  conflict  is  neutral,  but  the  Appletons  and  other  Northern  Irish  Jews  admit  that  community  members  feel  most  secure  with  the  pro-London,  or  Unionist,   status  quo.   In  Ulster,  the  two  sides  are  identified  by  their  colours:  blue  represents  Protestant,  pro-London  Unionists;  green  stands  for  pro-Dublin,  Catholic  Republicans.   A  local  businessman,  Cyril  Rosenberg,  says:  “I’m  a  true  blue  Ulsterman.  I  don’t  think  it’s  because  we  have  a  problem  with  the  Republicans.  It’s  just  that  Jews  tend  to  go  along  with  the  establishment.”   Many  Protestants  are  Christian  Zionists  who  are  members  of   pro-Israel  Christian  groups.  “These  people  are  more  pro-Israel  than  we  are,”  Shoshana  Appleton  quips.  Like  many,  she  is  somewhat  wary  of  the  Christian  fundamentalist  brand  of  Zionism,  which  often  is  connected  to  a  Messianic  vision  that  includes  conversion  of  the  Jews.   But  many  religious  Protestants  deny  they  have  an  evangelical  mission  eventually  to  convert  Jews.  Billy  Logan,  a  well-known  Unionist  with  moderate  views,  is  head  of  a  Protestant  group  called  the  Royal  Black  Institution,  which  adheres  to  a  literal  interpretation  of  the  Bible.   “I  believe  from  ancient  times  the  Jewish  people  have  a  right  to  a  homeland.  I  fervently  support  Israel  and  we  consider  ourselves  true  friends  of  our  Jewish  neighbours,”  he  says.   By  contrast,  the  Catholics,  as  a  minority  struggling  for  reunification   with  the  mostly  Catholic  Republic  of  Ireland,  often  draw  parallels  between  their  struggle  and  that  of  the   Palestinians.   ||  N  a  country  where  colours  have  H  the  kind  of  significance  usually  H  associated  with  gang  warfare,   1!  both  Unionists  and  Republicans  have  adopted  the  corresponding   banners  of  the  Israeli-Palestinian  con  flict.  In  Belfast,  each  side  has  flown  the  flag  of  its  respective  Middle  East   proxy.   The  incongruity  of  the  blue  and-white  Israeli  flag  flying  alongside  the  Union  Jack  and  other  Loyalist  banners  -  and  the  green  of  the  Palestinian  flag  flying  alongside  the  Irish  Tricolour—has  some  Belfast  Jews  somewhat  bemused.   Rabbi  Avraham  Citron,  a  US  native  who  recently  came  to  Belfast,  says  he  has  mixed  feelings  about  seeing  the  Israeli  flag  in  town.   “My  initial  feeling  was  pride  to  see  the  flag,  but  then  logic  kicked  in  and  I  thought,  ‘Why  the  extra  headache  of  another  struggle?”’   Regina  O’Callaghan,  chairwoman  of  the  Inter-Faith  Forum,  says,  “I  doubt  many  of  those  people  who  put  up  the  flags  even  know  where  Israel  or  Palestine  actually  is.”   Lately,  the  flags  mostly  have  disappeared,  some  by  order  of  the  paramilitaries’  leadership  and  some  by  the  wind  and  rain  that  batter  this  city  by  the  Irish  Sea.  But  they  could  return  with  the  approach  of  the  so-called  “Marching  Season”,  when  both  Protestants  and  Catholics  take  to  the  streets  in  a  show  of  pride  -  or,  many  would  say,  force.   Then  Belfast’s  Jews,  as  usual,  will  have  to  continue  trying  to  stay  out  of   the  way.   JTA ",2003-06-27
"  German  politicians  debate  antisemitism   TOBY  AXELROD   BERLIN  -  Seventy  years  ago,  Ger  many  was  concerned  with  the  “Jew   ish  problem”.  Today,  Germany  is  concerned  with  the  country’s  anti  semitism  problem.   In  a  wide-ranging,  two-hour  debate  on  antisemitism  in  Ger  many’s  parliament  on  Thursday,  leg  islators  agreed  that  the  country  must  combat  both  antisemitism  on  soci  ety’s  fringes  and  antipathy  toward  Jews  among  Germans  generally.   Their  solution:  education.   The  debate,  co-sponsored  by  all  the  major  political  parties,  was  prompted  by  the  recent  scandal  over  an  antise  mitic  speech  made  by  parliament  member  Martin  Hohmann,  a  mem  ber  of  the  Christian  Democratic  Party.   In  an  October  3  speech,  Hohmann  said  Jews  could  be  a  “nation  of  perpetrators”  because  of  the  role  some  Jews  played  in  the   Russian  Revolution.  Hohmann  since   has  been  thrown  out  of  the  party.   At  the  debate,  some  lambasted  Christian  Democratic  representa  tives  for  not  coming  down  harder  on  Hohmann  during  the  controversy.   Wolfgang  Thierse,  a  member  of  the  Social  Democratic  Party  and  the  president  of  the  Bundestag,  Ger  many’s  parliament,  said  it  is  impor  tant  for  Germans  to  fight  against  antisemitism  because  of  Germany’s  World  War  II  history  and  because   antisemitism  “is  undemocratic  and   damages  basic  human  rights”.   It  has  nothing  to  do  with  “the  passing  along  of  guilt  from  genera  tion  to  generation”,  Thierse  added.  Legislator  Norbert  Lammert  said  the  debate  is  necessary  because  “there  still  is  antisemitism  in  Germany”,  though  Germany  actually  has  fewer  problems  with  antisemitism  than  many  other  European  countries.   Many  others  echoed  that  last  point.  Jewish  life  in  Germany  is  blooming,  said  Wolfgang  Boetsch,  noting  the  signing  of  an  official  agreement  between  Germany’s  gov   ernment  and  the  Central  Council  of  Jews  in  Germany  and  the  imminent  construction  of  a  new  community   centre  in  Munich.   But  “there  is  also  another  reality”,  Boetsch  said.  “The  start  of  open  anti   semitism.  School  classes  must  hear  about  Jewish  culture  and  life,”  he  said,  “to  support  this  new  chapter  with  our  fellow  citizens  of  the  Jewish  faith”.   Volker  Beck  of  the  Green  Party  noted  that  many  Germans  believe  Jews  are  the  primary  beneficiaries  of  a  compensation  fund  for  victims  of  Nazi  slave  labour,  when  in  fact  80  per  cent  of  the  beneficiaries  are  not  Jewish.   “Israel  has  become  the  collective  Jew  of  the  nations,”  noted  legislator  Gert  Weisskirchen,  referring  to  criti  cism  of  the  Jewish  State.  While  criti  cism  of  Israel  is  legitimate,  he  said,  comparing  Israel  to  the  Nazi  regime   reawakens  the  “nightmare  of  anti   semitism”.   Weisskirchen  called  the  demonis   ing  of  Israel  “the  most  dangerous   development”,  and  said  warning  signs  can  be  seen  in  places  like  Paris.   “These  are  the  warning  signs,”  he   said  of  the  extremism.

"  Jews  attacked  at  SA  university   CAPE  TOWN  -  Jewish,  gay  and  black  students  have  been  assault  ed  by  right-wing  vigilante  groups  at  a  South  African  university.   Stellenbosch  University  was  an  Afrikaans  stronghold  during  the  apartheid  era.   The  Sunday  Times  reported  that  the  students  were  beaten  up  for  not  conforming  to  “the  cul  ture”  of  the  university  hostels,  and  that  the  Jewish  students’  union  had  been  forced  to  close  its  doors.   Union  of  Jewish  Students  for  mer  chair  Yvonne  Malan  had  her  hostel  door  kicked  in  and  received  hate  mail  after  refusing  to  attend  a  Christian  prayer  meeting.  She  claims  she  was  ordered  to  “con   vert  or  resign”  from  the  Students’  Representative  Council.   “Students  at  the  hostels  are   afraid  to  say  they  are  Jewish.  They  would  rather  lie  low  and  attend  church  services”,  she  said.  JTA ",2003-05-09

"  Antisemitic  speech   sparks  German  scandal   TOBY  AXELROD   BERLIN  —  A  politician’s  antisemitic  speech  has  erupted  into  a  scandal  in  Germany  as  his  party  scrambles  to  contain  the  damage  and  Jewish  lead   ers  consider  a  lawsuit   At  the  centre  of  the  storm  is  a  speech  in  which  MP  Martin  Hohmann,  of  the  conservative  Christian  Democratic  Union  (CDU),  called  Jews  a  “nation  of  per  petrators”  comparable  to  the  Nazis  and  defended  Henry  Ford’s  notori  ous  antisemitic  tract,  The  Interna  tional  Jew.   Wolfgang  Benz,  director  of  the  Centre  for  Research  on  Antisemitism   in  Berlin,  called  it  a  “unique  case”  in  the  postwar  era  because  it  was  “not  merely  a  slip  of  the  tongue  or  a  slo  gan.  No,  it  is  a  complete  argument,  a  whole  antisemitic  speech  using  old  stereotypes,”  he  told  JTA   While  the  stunned  CDU  leader   ship  struggled  to  control  the  damage  to  the  party,  observers  found  them  selves  asking  yet  again  whether  taboos  against  old  antisemitic  canards  were  weakening  in  Germany.   Paul  Spiegel,  head  of  the  Central  Council  of  Jews  in  Germany,  said   that  Hohmann’s  words  threatened  to   undermine  the  fragile  relationship   between  Jews  and  non-Jews  in  Ger   many.   The  council  is  considering  suing  Hohmann  for  inciting  hatred.  With  in  hours  of  being  informed  about  the  speech  last  week,  CDU  party  head  Angela  Merkel  sharply  criticised  Hohmann,  calling  his  words  “intoler  able”  and  distancing  the  party  from   him.   “Because  of  the  millions  of  people  killed  in  the  first  phase  of  the  [communist]  revolution,  one  might  be  justified  in  calling  the  Jews‘perpetrators'.”   MP  MARTIN  HOHMANN  German  Christian  Democratic  Union   Sources  dose  to  Merkel  said  she  had  called  Hohmann  and  found  that  he  “did  not  understand  what  all  the  fuss  was  about”.   Hohmann,  55,  known  for  fer  vently  conservative  views  on  every  thing  from  gay  rights  to  reparations  for  Nazi  victims,  delivered  the  speech  on  October  3,  German  Unity  Day,  to  constituents  in  the  tity  of  Neuhof,  in  the  western  German  state  of  Hessen.   The  speech  later  appeared  on  Hohmann’s  website,  but  it  went  largely  unnoticed  until  neo-Nazis  picked  it  up,  according  to  observers   of  the  extreme  right-wing  scene.   Among  other  statements,  Hohmann  said  Jews  had  influenced  the  communist  revolution  in  Russia  and  that,  “because  of  the  millions  of  people  killed  in  the  first  phase  of  the  revolution,  one  might  be  justified  in  calling  the  Jews  ‘perpetrators’”   He  also  said  Jews  were  leaders  of  the  Russian  secret  service  and  were   involved  in  executions.   “That  might  sound  shocking,”  he   continued.  “But  it  follows  the  same   logic  according  to  which  Germans  are  described  as  a  ‘nation  of  perpe   trators’.”   He  said  that  “those  Jews  who  were  committed  to  Bolshevism  and  to  the   revolution  had  already  cut  them  selves  off  from  religion.  They  were  Jews  according  to  background  and  upbringing,  but  their  outlook  was  that  of  burning  hatred  against  all  religion.  It  was  similar  with  the   National  Socialists.”   JTA ",2003-11-07

"  WORLD  BRIEFS   Belgians  pursue  Sharon   JERUSALEM  —  Belgium’s  prime  minister  says  he  is  not  opposed  to  amending  the  country’s  laws  to  allow  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  to  be  indicted  for  war  crimes.  Guy  Verhofstadt’s  statement  came  after  the  nation’s  Senate  gave  preliminary  approval  to  a  bill  that  would  enable  the  prosecution  of  war  crimes  regardless  of  where  the  defendant  lives.

Last  June,  the  courts  in  Belgium  dismissed  the  case  against  Sharon  because  he  is  not  living  there.   The  lawsuit  against  Sharon  was  brought  under  a  1993  law  on  “universal  jurisdiction”,  which  enables  Belgian  courts  to  judge  atrocities  committed  else  where,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  they  involved  Belgians.

"  BEYOND  WORDS   RUTHWAJNRYB   If  a  culture  has  certain  embedded  attitudes,   these  will  be  reflected  in  and  perpetuated  by  the  language.   IHANKS  to  Shakespeare,  most  Australian  children  finish   school  with  the  image  of  Shy  lock  imprinted  on  their  psy   che.  And  every  time  the  play  is  taught  or  performed,  Shylock  is  rehydrated.  I  remember  being  14,  the  only  Jew  in  the  class,  lying  very  low  through  interminable  lessons,  hoping  no-one  would  make  the  connection:  Shylock  the  Jew  and  me  the  Jew.  I  didn’t  like  Shylock  any  more  than  they  did.  That   made  it  worse.   Some  say  that  Shakespeare  was  only  showing  the  depths  of  despair  to  which  persecution  can  lead.  Or  that  Shylock  had  learned  well  from  a  Christian  model:  “The  villany  you  teach  me,  I  will  execute.”   Some  point  to  the  heartbreakingly  beautiful  lines:  “If  you  prick  us,  do  we  not  bleed?”  as  indicating  Shake  speare’s  enlightened  attitude.  Or  that  Shakespeare  was  (merely)  being  faith  ful  to  the  spirit  of  the  era,  both  that  in  which  he  wrote  and  that  represented  in  the  Venice  of  the  play.   Say  what  you  will  about  context  and  circumstance,  Shylock  is  usually  portrayed  as  a  powerfully  negative  stereotype,  replayed  generation  after  generation  to  a  new,  unsuspecting  cohort  of  young  minds.   Historical  facts  do  little  as  counter   balance.  The  populace  of  Venice  feared  the  great  Christian  banking  families  far  more  than  they  did  the  petty  Jewish  moneylenders.  Jews’  involvement  in  moneylending  derived  from  their  being  forbidden  to  own  land  or  enter  the  professions.  Special  tolls  and  levies  were  exacted  on  Jews,  like  the  head  tax  on  Jews  and  cattle  that  prevented  German  Jew  Moses  Mendelssohn  from  entering   his  hometown  of  Dessau.   Rabbi  Telishkin,  the  author  of  Jew  ish  Humour:  What  the  best  Jewish  jokes  say  about  the  Jews,  suggests  that  sup  posedly  lax  Jewish  attitudes  towards  tax  evasion  might  be  grounded  in  con  tempt  for  governments  which  have  for  centuries  treated  them  unfairly.   The  image  of  the  Jew  as  money  lender  or  dirty  dealer  or  banker  or  cheat  finds  its  contemptible  manifes  tation  in  nearly  every  language  with  an  association  with  Jews.   In  Spanish:  “A  real  Jew  will  get  gold  out  of  straw.”  In  Polish:  “Bargain  like  a  Jew  but  pay  like  a  Christian.”  In  Russian:  “A  Jewish  miser  will  regret  nothing  more  than  having  had  to  part   with  his  foreskin.”  In  Hungarian:  “Mammon  is  the  God  of  the  Jews.”   Nor  was  the  Jewish  position  helped  by  Karl  Marx,  who  wrote  in  A  World  Without  Jews:  “What  is  the  Jew’s  foundation?  Material  necessity,  private  advantage.  What  is  the  object  of  the  Jew’s  worship  ...?  Usury.  What  is  his  worldly  god?  Money.”  .   We’re  left  then  with  a  complicated  legacy.  Gerald  Krefetz  (in  Jews  and  Money)  argues  that  “writing  about  money  is  never  simple,  and  writing  about  Jews  is  fraught  with  dangers.  Writing  about  money  and  Jews  together  is  inflammatory  no  matter  how  cautiously  handled.”   Jewish  money  and  its  purported  influence  and  power  is  one  of  the  old  est  canards  of  antisemitism.  It’s  a  topic  discussed  in  the  softest  of  voices  not  only  by  Jews,  but  also  by  non-Jews  who  fear  being  tarred  by  the  brush  by  even  raising  the  subject.  There’s  the  joke  about  a  Jew  who  was  depressed  by  the  anti-Israel  bias  of  many  daily  papers  and  took  to  reading  an  extremist  right-wing  rag.  He  argued  that  it  was  less  depressing  to  be   reminded  that  the  Jews  controlled  the  media,  owned  the  banks  and  ran  the  world.   What’s  this  got  to  do  with  lan  guage?  One  thing  we  can  be  sure  of—  if  a  culture  has  certain  embedded  atti  tudes,  these  will  be  reflected  in  and  perpetuated  by  the  language.  Even  the  word  “denigrate”  is  reflexively  and  ironically  racist.   Not  surprisingly,  attitudes  towards  Jews  and  money  are  intermeshed  dis  cursively.  A  good  example  appeared  in  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald  (15/3/03)  reprinted  from  the  Lon  don-based  Guardian,  on  the  topic  of  honesty.  About  half  the  article  was  taken  up  with  a  quiz  called  “How  honest  are  you?”.   Here  the  reader  is  confronted  with  10  little  scenarios  involving  a  moral  choice  and  then,  as  is  typical  in  quizzes  of  this  sort,  three  options  are  offered,  each  option  being  progres  sively  and  predictably  more  extreme.   Four  of  the  10  “dishonest”  answers  had  a  distinctively  Jewish  timbre  to  their  style,  syntax  and  implied  intona  tion.  Like  this  one,  a  workplace  scenario  involving  maternity  leave  entitlements.  “No  way  are  you  going  back  to  work  after  having  the  baby.  However  your  employers  ...  don’t  know  that.  What  do  you  do?”   Option  c  is:  “Twelve  miserly  weeks!  Call  that  maternity  leave?  Twelve  years  I  should  get,  for  what  I  did  for  that  company.”   Yes  we  might  laugh,  momentarily,  at  turns  of  phrase  made  familiar  by  an  abundance  of  jokes  and  sayings.  But  look  hard  and  you  will  see  the  shadow  of  Shylock,  cast  long  and  low.

"  Two  truths  of  Easter:   An  Easter  reflection  by  Bro.  Thomas  Rice  of  Patrician  Brothers  Monastery  Thursday  Island   The  Easter  events,  in  a  compelling  way,  present  the  truths  of  Christianity.  The  trial,  death  and  resurrection  of  Jesus  gather  up  and  are  the  embodiment  of  His  teachings.  Jesus  said:  ""I  am  the  truth"".  His  truth  is  starkly  different  from  contemporary  beliefs  and  attitudes.  That  truth  is  at  once  personal  and  social,  private  and  public.  It  interprets  and  gives  guidance  to  individual  lives  and  proclaims  principles  for  the  corporate  affairs  of  humanity.  The  private  truth  of  Jesus  presents  a  unique  interpretation  of  human  nature  and  gives  clear  guidance  for  personal  living.  It  comes  to  grips  with  the  doubts  and  fears,  the  moral  failures,  the  confusions  and  pressures  of  life.  Christian  truth  is  both  pessimistic  and  hopeful  about  human  nature.  It  recognises  the  reality  of  the  Doctrine  of  the  Fall.  Whatever  life  was  meant  to  be,  rebellion  against  God  and  its  consequences  in  human  sinfulness  are  a  fact  of  existence.  The  problems  and  aberrations  of  people  lie  far  deeper  than  is  often  imagined.  Education  and  social  changes  can  elevate  people  but  they  do  not  go  to  the  depth  of  human  depravity.  Recent  child  molestations  and  murders,  the  greed  and  corruption  seen  in  society  and  the  cruelties  of  current  regional  wars  are  an  indictment  of  humanity.  Jesus  said  people  must  be  ""born  again"".  If  people  are  to  find  deliverance  and  rise  to  their  potential  a  profound   inner  transformation  must  occur.  Through  penitence  and  forgiveness  and  the  receiving  of  Divine  Grace  lives  can  be  transformed.  Without  this  drastic  treatment  people  will  remain  in  bondage  to  evil  and  be  unable  to  rise  to  the  visions  they  may  have  of  nobler  living.  The  good  news  is  that  with  God's  help  new  life  is  possible  for  all  people.  Jesus  inaugurated  a  new  era  of  private,  intimate  prayer.  Human  beings  are  not  self-sufficient.  The  body  cannot  survive  without  food.  Adequate  intellectual  life  requires  stimulation  from  beyond  the  mind:  emotional  satisfaction  comes  from  love  and  friendship.  Similarly  the  inner  spirit  of  people  needs  to  receive  constantly  the  grace,  the  power  of  God.  Hence,  at  the  heart  of  the  private  truth  of  Jesus  is  a  call  to  worship  and  prayer.  As  there  are  surrounding  the  body  resources  sufficient  for  its  need  so  there  are  flowing  around  the  spirit  a  full  measure  of  God's  power.  It  becomes  available  through  personal  faith  and  the  practices  of  religion.  Achievements  are  registered  by  intellectual  and  physical  effort  and  by  the  power  of  prayer.  Jesus  calls  for  constant  dependence  on  God.  The  private  truth  of  Jesus  gives  a  description  of  how  to  live.  It  is  a  summons  to  a  distinctive  life-style  modelled  on  the  teaching  and  example  of  Jesus.  Moral  confusion  There  is  a  tremendous  confusion  today  over  the  way  we  live.  So   many  of  the  moral  signposts  are  down.  Varying  voices  are  being  heard;  do  what  comes  naturally,  greed  is  good,  be  detached,  avoid  commitment.  Through  it  all  sounds  a  very  different  challenge.  It  is  call  to  Christian  living.  The  Christian  lifestyle  is  exemplified  in  Jesus  of  Nazareth.  It  is  the  way  of  gentleness,  not  harshness  and  cruelty.  It  shows  a  forgiving  rather  than  a  bitter  revengeful  spirit.  It  is  to  reach  out  in  kindness  to  others,  rejecting  self-centredness.  Self-giving  and  sacrifice  replace  grasping  for  gain  and  the  struggle  to  win  an  advantage  over  others.  It  is  the  way  of  purity  of  imagination,  thought  and  action,  of  discipline  and  faithfulness  in  sexual  relationships.  It  means  renouncing  violence  in  personal  and  corporate  affairs.  Amid  the  confusion,  the  addictions,  the  conflicts  of  today  the  Easter  message  offers  the  truth  for  personal  living.  The  Easter  message  is  public  truth.  It  grapples  with  the  corporate  issues  of  humanity.  Through  the  trial  and  death  of  Jesus  at  the  first  Easter,  social  and  political  principles  emerged  which  are  in  a  striking  way  relevant  today.  Jesus  showed  what  is  called  today  a  preferential  option  for  the  poor.  His  ministry  began  with  the  declaration  that  He  was  anointed  to  bring  good  news  to  the  poor.  He  showed  constant  identification  with  the  helpless  and  the  marginalised  people  of  society.  Exploitation  and  heartlessness  towards  the  fatherless  and  the  widow  are  condemned.  Always  He  stood  with  the  poor,  championing  their  cause.  Unemployment  With  two  million  unemployed  in  Australia  the  parable  about  the  men  standing  idle  in  the  marketplace  is  full  of  significance.  It  shows  awareness,  concern  for  the  unemployed.  In  the  story  men  worked  for  varying  periods  of  time  yet  at  the  end  of  the  day  were  all  paid  the  same  wage.  It  declares  that  need  rather  than  merit  must  determine  action.  Each  man  has  similar  personal  and  family  needs  requiring  a  sustenance  payment.  It  defines  the  principle  which  has  given  rise  to  the  welfare  state,  to  unemployment  allowances.  It  asserts  that  provision  of  a  basic  living  allowance  for  all  people  is  a   fundamental  right  not  a  charity.  The  majority  of  the  human  family  is  desperately  poor.  Christian  truth  places  this  mass  of  people  on  the  heart  and  conscience  of  the  world.  It  means  that  the  policies  of  all  governments  should  be  judged  according  to  the  effects  on  the  poor.  The  poor  must  be  central  in  all  local  and  global  planning  and  action.  The  public  truth  of  Jesus  was  a  declaration  of  inclusiveness.  He  stood  for  the  value,  the  equality  of  all  people.  He  crossed  the  class  and  cast  barriers  of  the  first  century.  There  was  no  hint  of  discrimination  against  anybody.  All  were  accepted:  the  good  of  and  the  bad,  the  outcasts,  women,  people  of  all  colours  and  races.  The  public  truth  of  Jesus  shows  how  to  deal  with  conflict,  violence  and  war.  His  way  of  resolving  conflict  is  unique.  It  calls  for  forgiveness  of  enemies  rather  than  bitterness  and  a  spirit  of  revenge.  It  rejects  violence.  By  acts  of  positive  goodwill  it  seeks  to  turn  enemies  into  friends.  It  recognises  that  violence  begets  violence  and  tries  to  break  the  evil  cycle  by  refusing  to  stoop  to  the  weapons  of  opponents.  Christianity  confronts  the  world  with  the  power  of  non-violence.  Jesus  was  the  greatest  leader  of  non-violence  in  history.  No  word  can  be  found  on  His  lips  endorsing  violence  or  war.  On  the  contrary,  His  words  are  specific:  they  that  take  the  sword  shall  die  by  the  sword.  In  the  last  week  of  His  life  Jesus  lived  out  the  truths  he  proclaimed.  Although  seemingly  helpless,  He  remained  master  of  events.  Nothing  made  Him  stoop  to  anger  or  hatred.  He  absorbed  the  evil  which  engulfed  Him.  In  the  extreme  pain  and  loss  of  the  crucifixion,  He  still  prayed  for  those  who  were  destroying  Him:  Father  forgive  them,  they  know  not  what  they  do.  To  the  very  end  in  His  own  person  He  proclaimed  the  truth  of  non-violence,  of  the  power  of  love.  The  private  and  the  public  truth  of  Easter  is  clearly  relevant  today.  It  confronts  accepted  assumptions  and  actions  with  a  very  different  interpretation  of  the  way  to  live  personally  and  how  to  conduct  public  affairs.  It  is  a  truth  which  offers  freedom  from  bondage  to  the  past  and  a  new  beginning. ",2003-04-18
"  Nazi  churches  exposed  in  book   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   A  NEW  book  on  Nazism  exposes  the   German  Protestant  churches  and   their  complicity  in  Nazi  policies  of  antisemitism,  eugenics  and  racial  purity.   Richard  Steigmann-Gall,  assistant  history  professor  at  Kent  State  Uni  versity  in  Ohio,  told  ABC  Radio  National’s  Religion  Report  that  the  Nazis  had  strong  ideological  roots  in  “positive  Christianity”  which  allowed  them  to  develop  theories  that  Jesus  was  an  Aryan.   In  his  book  The  Holy  Reich,  pub  lished  by  Cambridge  University  Press,  Professor  Steigmann-Gall  says  the  Nazi  movement  developed  a  set  of  ideas  and  ethics,  including  anti  semitism,  which  Hitler  successfully  tied  in  with  Christianity.   Some  leading  Nazis  even  saw  the  movement  as  a  completion  of  the  Reformation  begun  by  Martin  Luther,  a  virulent  antisemite.   “Protestants  cast  Luther  as  not  just  the  first  Protestant,  but  also  the  first  German.  Hitler  called  Protestantism  the  natural  religion  of  the  German.   “Churchmen  in  Germany  -  and  churchwomen,  for  that  matter  -  often  held  a  very  favourable  view  of  Nazism,”  Professor  Steigmann-Gall  said.  Hider,  despite  his  love  of  Wag  nerian  opera  and  its  pre-Christian  Teutonic  ideas,  ridiculed  the  pagan  ism  of  some  of  his  henchmen,  includ  ing  Gestapo  chief  Heinrich  Himmler  and  murderer  Alfred  Rosenberg.   He  saw  his  favourite  Wagner  opera,  Parsifal,  as  a  metaphor  of  Jesus’  life.  While  the  Nazi  leadership,  including  Hider,  was  disproportion  ately  Catholic,  the  leaders  had  an  antagonistic  view  of  Catholicism  as  an  international  religion  led  from  Rome,  and  not  part  of  Germany.   Richard  Steigmann  Galf’sbook,  7he   Holy  Reich,  claims   that  the  Nazis   developed  a  set  of  ideas,  including   antisemitism,  which  Hitler  successfully  tied  in  with  Christianity.   Almost  to  a  man,  the  Nazis  insist  ed  that  Jesus  was  not  Jewish  but  an  Aryan,  that  the  Old  Testament  should  be  dispensed  with  as  a  Jewish  tract,  and  that  it  should  be  removed  from  the  Christian  canon.   Professor  Steigmann-Gall  said  the  Nazis  did  not  invent  these  ideas,  but  that  Hitler’s  ideas  were  borrowed.  In  the   same  way,  the  idea  of  Jesus  being  an  Aryan  was  also  borrowed.  The  active  support  for  Nazi  eugenics  -  forced  ster  ilisation  -  came  from  the  Protestant   Church,  particularly  a  group  called  the  Inner  Mission,  a  Protestant  welfare  organisation,  he  said.   “It’s  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  these  are  not  people  who  didn’t  realise  what  they  were  doing,”  Profes  sor  Steigmann-Gall  said.   Lutheran  theology  had  always   maintained  that  God  had  created  cer   tain  orders  in  society,  like  the  family,   the  law  and  the  state.   Belief  that  God  created  distinct  races  and  that  God  was  opposed  to  intermixing  of  the  races  led  to  the  idea  that  the  strength  and  purity  of  the  race  was  willed  by  God.   “It  becomes  possible,  as  perverse  as  it  sounds,  for  Protestant  theolo  gians  in  the  Inner  Mission  to  suggest  that  we  need  to  sterilise  these  people  as  being  the  issue  of  sin,  the  guilt  and  sin,”  Professor  Steigmann-Gall  said.   Because  they  had  been  so  impli  cated  in  the  logic  of  racial  thinking,  they  then  found  they  were  unable  to  defend  their  own  charges  when  the  Nazis  came  to  round  them  up  and  murder  them  in  a  euthanasia  pro   gram.

"  BUSH'S  REASONS   COULD  a  reason  for  the  war  on  Iraq  be  that  Bush  wants  another  funda  mentalist  Muslim  government  in   the  Middle  East?   Bush  has  worked  very  hard  to  break  down  the  separation  of   Church  and  State  in  the  US.   Originally,  the  “war  against  ter  ror”  was  against  Al-Qaeda.  Now  it  has  shifted  to  Iraq.   Saudi  Arabia  and  Iran  are  reli   gious  states.  Saudi  Arabia  is  domi  nated  by  the  Sunni  Wahhabi  sect  that  apparently  inspired  the  destruc   tion  of  the  World  Trade  Centre.  Iran   is  dominated  by  the  Shi’ite  Ayatol   lahs.   Bush  is  dominated  by  the  puri  tanical  Christian  Methodist  sect.   Iraq  is  secular  compared  to  most  Arab  states.  Iraq  has  something  close  to  equality  for  women.   They  can  teach  in  universities  or  practise  the  professions.  Bush  has  opposed  legislation  providing  equal  opportunities  for  women  and  has  refused  to  fund  programs  of  the  UN  seeking  that  goal.   Could  he  have  a  vision  of  the  sec  ular  dictator,  Saddam  Hussein,  replaced  by  a  Muslim  true-believer  who  would  proclaim  the  greater  glory  of  God  and  keep  women  in  their  place?

He  based  his  stand  on  what  he   claims  is  a  tendency  by  Australians  who,  “for  fear  of  offending  people  of  other  religions”,  are  unwilling  to  “express  the  traditional  customs”.   Acknowledging  that  Australians   celebrate  such  festivals  as  Chanukah   and  the  end  of  Ramadan,  he  expressed  concern  that  several  kindergartens   had  decided  not  to  celebrate  Christ  mas  out  of  concern  that  non-Christ   ian  children  might  be  offended.   “They  lost  the  point  of  what  multi  culturalism  is  about  -  an  opportunity  to  have  the  world  within  our  nation,  but  all  these  religions,  all  these  cul  tures,  at  work.”   Executive  Council  of  Australian   Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  said  that  “people  celebrating  Christmas  is  not  a  negative.

"  Call  for  international  inquiry  into  Indigenous  education   A  prominent  North  Queensland  Clergyman  has  called  for  a  National  Inquiry  into  Indigenous  education.  Rev.  Shayne  Blackman  is  the  National  Administrator  of  the  Uniting  Aboriginal  and  Islander  Christian  Congress,  the  Indigenous  arm  of  the  Uniting  Church.  He  is  also  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  the  Shalom  Christian  College,  an  Indigenous  controlled  school  for  Aboriginal  and  Torres  Strait  Islander  children,  from  Preschool  to  Year  12,  in  Townsville.  Up  to  40  Torres  Strait  and  N.P.A.  students  attend  the  College.  ""It  is  true  that  the  state  of  education  for  Indigenous  children,  particularly  from  remote  and  rural  communities  throughout  Australia,  is  in  a  critical  state.  And  that  includes  Queensland,""  Rev.  Blackman  said.  ""This  is  why  I  am  calling  for  a  National  enquiry  into  Aboriginal  education  and  schooling.  We  need  to  find  out  the  causes  of  the  poor  educational  outcomes  and  put  in  place  policies  and  strategies  to  properly  deal  with  the  issues.  ""The  capacity  of  indigenous  people  to  go  on  to  tertiary  studies  and  employment  and  fulfil  life  aspirations  is  severely  hampered  without  proper  schooling.  For  example,  in  2001,6.4%  of  Indigenous  people  in  the  Northern  Territory  had  received  a  formal  qualification  at  a  certificate  level  or  above.  This  compares  with  a  national  figure  of  36.3%  for  Indigenous  people.""  Rev.  Blackman  said  he  was  responding  to  criticism  from  the  Northern  Territory  Government  about  children  from  the  Territory  attending  Shalom  College.  ""We  have  about  240  children  attending  the  high  school  section  of  the  school  from  all  over  Queensland   and  interstate.  Of  these,  around  50  children  are  from  the  Northern  Territory,  mainly  from  the  Tennant  Creek  and  Katherine  region""  Rev.  Blackman  said.  ""The  Territory  government  is  critical  of  us  for  allowing  Territory  children  to  attend  our  school  in  Queensland.  I  believe  they  simply  want  to  cover  up  the  inadequacies  of  their  own  schooling  for  Aboriginal  children.  They  attack  us  in  order  to  divert  attention  from  the  real  issue,  which  is,  'Why  are  Territory  children  from  places  like  Tennant  Creek  wanting  to  seek  an  education  outside  the  Northern  Territory?""'  Rev.  Blackman  said,  ""The  reason  is  because  the  Territory  education  system  is  failing  Aboriginal  people.  For  example,  as  one  measure  of  educational  outcomes,  in  2001,  only  7.1%  of  Indigenous  people  in  the  N.T.  aged  15  years  and  over  stated  that  they  had  completed  Year  12  or  equivalent.  ""This  compares  with  a  national  figure  of  39.5%  for  the  non-  Indigenous  population.  For  Queensland  the  figurefor  Indigenous  people  was  22.7%.""  ""Aboriginal  parents  also  want  to  exercise  choice  about  where  their  children  go  to  school.  They  are  being  criticised  and  discouraged  from  doing  so  by  the  N.T.  government.  It  is  ridiculous  to  think  that  you  can  build  a  wall  around  the  Territory  border  and  try  and  cocoon  people  within  some  kind  of  welfare  state,""  Rev.  Blackman  stated.  ""Parents  want  their  children  to  succeed  in  education,  get  good  jobs  and  becomecontributorstothe  economy  of  Australia.  How  stupid  it  is  to  try  and  discourage  parents  and  children  from  achieving  these  goals,""  he  said. ",2003-09-19
"  Own  backyard   I  WAS  very  happy  to  see  that  Josh  Bornstein  and  his  Coalition  for  the  Reform  of  Refugee  Policy  are  lobby  ing  the  government  for  protection  of  the  Islamic  community.

Do  Christian,  Hindu  and  Muslim  schools,  churches,  temples  and  mosques  require  all  this  protection?  I   don’t  think  so.

"  Rich  characters  in  Tobsha  Learner’s  erotic  medieval  tale   BOOK  REVIEW   MICHELLE  STE1N-EVERS  FRANKL   THE  WITCH  OF  COLOGNE   Tobsha  Learner   HarperCollins  Publishers,  2003,512  pages,  $29.95   THERE  are  some  books,  when  you   \ead  them,  for  which  you  can  see  the  movie  version  rise  up  before  you.  Tobsha  Learner’s  The  Witch  of  Cologne  is  one  of  them.  If  you  like  juicy  historical  novels  with  richly  drawn  Jewish  characters  living  inter  esting  lives,  then  this  is  a  novel  you   must  read.   Learner  has  crafted  a  well  i/researched  piece  of  historical  fiction.  Her  characters,  both  Jewish  and  Christian,  are  surprising  in  their  depth  of  personality  and  by  their   believability.   For  some  readers,  the  clarity  of  their  erotic  lives,  as  conjured  up  in  this  book,  might  be  a  litde  too  clear.   The  story  takes  place  in  a  time  of  European  Jewish  history  that  is  well  known  to  contemporary  society,  even  as  parts  of  it  remain  obscure:  the  Cologne  and  Amsterdam  of  the  Age  of  Enlightenment.   Not  only  the  Enlightenment,  but  that  pivotal  time  of  Jewish  history  where  the  Inquisition,  the  Sabbatean  movement  and  the  Enlightenment  overlap.  So  many  choices  had  to  be  made;  so  many  paths  that  a  young  Jewish  woman  could  follow.   The  heroine  is  a  young  Jewish  woman,  Ruth,  the  daughter  of  an  Ashkenazi  rabbi  and  a  Sephardi  mid  wife.  She  is  well  educated  in  religious  matters  and  by  an  adventurous  path  becomes  educated  in  the  modern  sci  ences  of  obstetrics.  She  is  also  some  what  of  a  kabbalist.   There  is  an  amazing  scene  in  the  novel  where  Ruth,  as  an  adolescent,  successfully  conjures  up  Lilith  and   has  a  conversation  with  her.   Ruth  is  pursued  by  a  psychotic  Inquisitor,  who  had  been  romantically   rebuffed  by  her  mother  during  her  youth,  so  that  his  personal  vendetta  against  the  mother  is  visited  on  the  daughter.   By  use  of  extensive  research,  a  cre  ative  imagination  and  powerful  writ  ing,  Learner  is  able  to  convey  the  horror  of  the  Inquisitor’s  tortures  and  Ruth’s  utter  helplessness  in  their  face.   I  Ruth  is  loved  by  two   men:  one,  a  rabbi  involved  with  the   movement  of  the  false  Messiah,  Shabbtai  Zvi,   and  a  Jesuit  priest.  Each  wants  to  save  her  and   i  bring  her  to  redemption.   While  reading  the  chilling  scenes  between  Ruth  and  the  villainous   Inquisitor,  one  can  almost  smell  the  evil  rising  off  him  and  feel  her  cold  fear.   Ruth  is  loved  by  two  men:  one,  a  rabbi  involved  with  the  movement  of  the  false  Messiah,  Shabbtai  Zvi,  and  a  Jesuit  priest.  Each  wants  to  save  her  and  bring  her  to  redemption,  so  Ruth   is  faced  with  hard  choices  not  neces   sarily  validated  by  her  father,  her  community  or  by  society  at  large.   The  story  in  the  end  is  a  real  page  turner.  The  characters,  Jewish  and  Christian,  jump  off  the  page  and   demand  the  readers’  attention.   The  book  has  some  flaws  though.  In  the  first  printing,  there  were  many  small  errors  about  medieval  Jewish  day-to-day  life  in  the  otherwise  impeccable  research.  Those  have  been  corrected  in  the  second  printing.   Learner’s  style  of  writing  -  the  erotic  explicitly  -  might  be  off-put  ting  for  some  readers  and  there  are  portions  of  the  book  not  for  them.  But  even  though  there  are  erotic  scenes,  they  are  not  gratuitous  and  serve  to  show  the  involvement  of  the  characters  with  each  other.   The  character  of  Ruth  is  a  likable   Jewish  heroine  with  great  strength,  courage  and  wisdom.  She  is  noble  and  honest;  a  modem  woman  set  in  a  far-off  time.  Learner  should  be  congratulated  for  her  successful  conception.   Michelle  Stein-Evers  Frankl  is  a   Sydney-based  reviewer. ",2003-06-06
"  BISHOP  FRAME   THE  article  by  Aviva  Bard  (  Anger  at  army  bishop’s  attack”,  AJN  21/4/03)  claimed  to  be  a  report  of  remarks  I  made  during  an  interview  with  Terry   Lane  on  ABC  Radio  National  on  East  er  Day.   Ms  Bard’s  piece  contained  a  num  ber  of  errors  and  unfair  imputations.   I  am  neither  “a  senior  Anglican  bishop”  nor  the  “army  bishop”.  I  am  one  of  the  most  junior  Anglican  bish  ops  in  Australia,  while  my  responsi  bilities  encompass  all  three  services,  not  just  the  army.   My  appointment  as  Anglican  Bishop  to  the  Australian  Defence  Force  is  an  ecclesiastical  one.  My   comments  were  those  of  a  Christian   leader,  not  a  government  official.  This  was  made  plain.   I  did  not  say  “the  Iraq  war  was  a  war  by  Christians  and  Jews  against   Muslims”.  I  stressed  that  the  war  was   not  a  religiously  inspired  conflict.   Nor  did  I  agree  with  Lane’s  asser  tion  that  Australia  joined  Bush’s  “cru  sade”.  I  stated  the  opposite:  that  Australia  had  very  different  reasons  for  participating  in  multinational  operations  against  Iraq.   My  remarks  concerning  Israel  were  in  response  to  a  question.  It  had  not  been  my  intention  to  speak  about  Israel  in  relation  to  the  war,  although  I  have  always  believed  that  Israel,  like  any  sovereign  nation,  has  the  right  to  provide  for  its  security  and  ought  to  be  free  of  the  kind  of  threat  posed  by  Iraq.   Had  I  been  asked  about  the  atroc  ities  committed  within  Israel  by  Hamas  or  Hezbollah,  I  would  have  expressed  condemnation  for  what  can  only  be  described  as  barbarous   acts  of  terrorism.   To  say  I  “attacked  Judaism  and  Israel”  is  to  distort  my  remarks  and  to  impute  motives  I  do  not  possess.  There  was  no  attack  on  either.   Despite  accusations  contained  in  emails  prompted  by  the  article,  I  am  not  a  racist,  nor  do  I  hold  antisemitic  views.   I  count  it  a  blessing  to  work  along  side  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  as  a  member  of  the  Religious  Advisory  Committee  to  the  Services.   It  was  a  pleasure  to  review  and  commend  his  excellent  book  The  Jew   ish  Way:  Jews  and  Judaism  in  Australia  for  a  Christian  theological  journal   earlier  this  year.   In  taking  the  leading  role  in  pro  moting  religious  harmony  as  the  theme  for  the  Defence  Department’s  observance  of  Harmony  Day,  my  commitment  to  interfaith  dialogue  has  been  demonstrated.   In  her  depiction  of  my  conversa  tion,  Ms  Bard  has  been  neither  accu  rate  nor  fair.  Notwithstanding  the  unwarranted  allegations,  I  remain  committed  to  promoting  religious  harmony.   DR  TOM  FRAME  Anglican  Bishop  to  the  Australian  Defence  Force   The  article  accurately  referred  to  Bishop   Frame  as  the  Australian  Defence  Force   Anglican  bishop;  he  was  described  as   “army  bishop”  in  the  headline.  The  remarks  about  the  Iraq  war  being  waged  by  Christians  and  Jews  against  Muslims,  and  about  Bush’s  crusade,  were   made  by  Terry  Lane,  not  by  Bishop  Frame;  the  error  is  acknowledged  and   regretted.

"  Investigate  Islamic  schools  for   links  to  terrorism,  urges  Danby   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   AUSTRALIANS  should  be  concerned  about  links  between  Saudi  funding  of  Islamic  schools  in  Australia  and  sup  port  for  Islamic  terrorist  groups,  Fed  eral  MP  Michael  Danby  said  this  week.   “There  is  a  pattern  where  Islamic  schools  in  Malaysia,  Afghanistan,  Indonesia  and  elsewhere  have  been  used  as  breeding-grounds  and  bases  for  terrorist  attacks  like  Bali,”  he  said.   “There  must  be  concern  about  a   similar  pattern  here.  I  will  continue  to  point  this  out  to  the  State  and  Federal  Governments,  no  matter  how  incon  venient  or  uncomfortable  this  is.”   “Little  attention  has  been  paid  to  two   teachers  at  an  Islamist  school  in  Western   Australia  who  were   identified  as  leaders  of  Jemaah  Islamyia.”   MICHAEL  DANBY   Federal  MP   Danby  is  the  only  MP  to  have   asked  ministers  in  Federal  Parliament  whether  Australian  Islamic  schools   receiving  Saudi  funding  might  be  teaching  radical  Wahabi,  al-Qaeda  or  Jemaah  Islamiah  (JI)  doctrines,  rather  than  moderate  forms  of  Islam.   Immigration  Minister  Philip  Rud  dock  and  Education  Minister  Brendan  Nelson  both  said  they  were  unaware  of   MP  Michael  Danby   teachers  espousing  Wahabi,  al-Qaeda  or  JI  doctrines  in  Australia.   But  Dr  Nelson  last  month  wrote  to   state  and  territory  education  minis  ters,  calling  on  them  to  ensure  “rigor  ous”  inspection  of  Islamic  schools.   He  said  he  was  acting  because  citi  zens  were  worried  that  the  schools   might  be  “encouraging  anti-Christian  and  anti-Western  feeling”.   The  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  denies  that  its  schools  foster  anti-Christian  senti   ment,  saying  it  encourages  Islamic  schools  to  emphasise  Australian  and  Aboriginal  culture  and  history.   Danby  emphasised  that  he  believed  the  vast  majority  of  Australian  Mus  lims  are  loyal  and  peace-loving.   Of  the  24  Islamic  schools  in  Aus  tralia  which  receive  federal  funding  and  teach  10,743  students,  “it  is  reas  suring  to  note  that  most  exhibit  com  mitment  to  pluralism  and  tolerance”.   But  he  remains  worried  about  the   potential  for  fanatical  teachers  to   mask  extremist  activities.   He  is  particularly  concerned  that  little  attention  has  been  paid  to  two  Islamic  teachers  at  an  Islamist  school  (madrasa)  in  Western  Australia  who  were  identified  last  year  as  leaders  of  Jemaah  Islamyia:  Abdul  Rahim  Ayub  was  deported  and  his  twin,  Abdur  Rahman  Ayub,  fled  to  Indonesia.   They  were  described  in  the  media  as  conspirators  with  British-born  Islamic  convert  Jack  Roche,  49.   ASIO  officers  arrested  Roche  last   November  and  charged  him  with  conspiring  with  others  in  Malaysia,  Pakistan  and  Afghanistan  to  blow  up  the  Israeli  Embassy  in  Canberra  and  the  Israeli  Consulate  in  Sydney.   He  is  due  to  stand  trial  in  the  West  Australian  District  Court  on  May  1.   Federal  Attorney-General  Daryl  Williams  has  since  dismissed  a  report  from  Israel  warning  that  Australia  could  be  a  target  of  terrorist  attacks  in  coming  months,  but  has  said  ASIO   knows  there  are  Islamic  extremists   and  sympathisers  in  Australia,  partic  ularly  those  associated  with  JI.   Danby  sought  unsuccessfully  to  establish  how  many  Muslim  institu  tions  and  religious  schools  in  Aus  tralia  receive  Saudi  funding  and  what  conditions  are  attached  to  the  funds.   Dr  Nelson  said  non-government  schools  are  free  to  raise  income  and  are   not  required  to  disclose  the  sources.  Of   8237  visitors  from  Saudi  Arabia  since   1996-97,  two,  sponsored  by  a  religious  organisation,  received  religious  worker  visas  for  teaching  or  pastoral  care. ",2003-04-11
"  [?]   Newcastle  and  Manoora  in  rescues  at  home  and  abroad   By  LCDR  Andrew  Stackpool  &amp;  Graham  Davis   In  a  fine  display  of  seamanship  HM  AS  Manoora  (CMDR  Martin  Brooker)  has  suc  cessfully  rescued  eight  Iraqi  fishermen  from  a  sinking  fishing  vessel  in  the  Persian  Gulf.   Manoora  deployed  from  Fleet  Base  East  for  operations  in  The  Gulf  on  May  12.  On  Saturday  June  7  the  amphibious  trans  port  was  transiting  The  Gulf  when  she  received  a  'Mayday'  distress  message.  Almost  simulta  neously  her  lookouts  sighted  a  large  fishing  vessel  listing  heavily  about  five  miles  away.  Manoora  immediately  closed  the  stricken  474-tonne  vessel  and  saw  she  was  taking  water.  She  capsized  and  sank  within  two  minutes.  Immediately  the  LPA  launched  her  two  RHIBs  and  rescued  all  eight  crewmembers.  They  had  suffered  only  minor  shock  and  injuries  and  subsequently  were  transferred  ashore.  CMDR  Brooker  is  proud  of  his  ship's  com  pany's  efforts.   ""The  vessel  sank  very  quickly  and  it  was  imperative  we  carried  out  the  rescue  quickly  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the  crew.  ""The  rescue  was  a  success  thanks  to  the  pro  fessionalism  and  swift  actions  of  Manoora''  s  men  and  women,""  he  said.  Manoora  is  deployed  to  return  to  Australia  equipment  used  by  the  ADF  during  Operation  Falconer.  In  the  meantime  HMAS  Newcastle  (CAPT  Gerry  Christian)  headed  deep  into  the  Indian  Ocean  to  rescue  a  Briton  who  suffered  serious  injuries  when  he  was  thrown  face  first  into  the  gunwale  of  the  7  metre  plywood  boat  he  and  a  friend  were  trying  to  row  from  Australia  to  an  island  off  Africa.  Rescued  were  45-year-old  Mike  Noel-Smith  and  Rob  Abernethy,  3  1  .  The  two  Britons  set  off  from  Carnarvon  ear  lier  this  year  to  row  to  Reunion  Island  off  Africa  in  a  bid  to  raise  money  for  charity.  Continued  page  2   Continued  from  oaae  1   The  emergency,  which  spanned  ten  days,  saw  Newcastle  proceed  to  a  position  1400  nautical  miles  WNW  of  Exmouth.   The  pair  was  43  days  into  the  row  and  deep  into  the  Indian  Ocean  south-west  of  the  Cocos  Islands  when  their  craft  was  hit  by  high  waves,  damaging  the  boat's  rudder.  One  particularly  large  wave  hit  the  boat  hurling  Mike  Noel-Smith  face  first  into  the  gunwale.  He  suf  fered  severe  concussion  and  other  injuries.  By  Monday  June  2  his  condition  had  deteriorated  and  Rob  Abernethy  sought  medical  advice  using  sat-  phone.  The  response  was  he  needed  medical  help  as  soon  as  possible.  He  made  the  call.  The  Rescue  Coordination  Centre  in  Canberra  deter  mined  that  IIMAS  Newcastle  was  the  nearest  ship  with  a  doctor  on  board  and  she  was  tasked  to  assist  the  row  ers.  At  the  time  she  was  south  of  Christmas  Island  en  route  to  a  port  visit  at  Bunbury.  CAPT  Christian  ordered  a  turn  to  starboard  and  at  22  knots  the  warship  headed  west  with  I  I25nm  to  steam.  Shortly  before  sunset  on  June  5  Newcastle  launched  her  Scahawk  to  search  for  the  boat.  The  aviators  found  the  craft  and  reported  her  position  by  radio.  Newcastle  quickly  closed  and  arrived  after  dark.  In  marginal  conditions  she  launched  her  RIIIBs  with  medical  personnel  on  board  and  they  went  across  to  the  stricken  boat.  The  Britons  were  transferred  to  Newcastle's  medical  facility  where  the  doctor  checked  Mike  and  reported  him  in  a  stable  condition.  The  transfer  complete,  Newcastle  looked  to  the  retrieval  of  their  craft.  Some  smart  seamanship  by  the  Bosuns  Mates  and  it  was  brought  aboard  and  secured  on  deck.

"  KEY  INGREDIENTS   THE  recently-launched  Australian  National  Dialogue  of  Christians,  Mus  lims  and  Jews  offers  potential  for  greater  interfaith  harmony.  But  sever  al  ingredients  will  be  necessary  for  it  to   work.   All  parties  must  be  equally  willing  to  engage  in  self-criticism.  Minorities   I   [   shouldn’t  just  blame  the  majority  for  feelings  of  exclusion,  but  should  also  ask  whether  they  have  themselves  contributed  to  disharmony  through  certain  mindsets  and  behaviours.   There  must  also  be  a  right  mix  between  sensitivity  and  honesty.  For  example,  dialogue  activities  will  need  to  recognise  that  not  all  Muslims  are   mini-Bin  Ladens.   At  the  same  time,  Muslim  partici  pants  will  need  to  ask  what  it  is  about  Islam  that  fuels  the  recurring  Bin  Laden  phenomenon.   Here  in  Britain,  interfaith  dialogue  activities  frequendy  hit  upon  the  issue  of  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict.   In  the  new  Australian  forum,  Christian  and  Muslim  participants  must  shun  the  temptation  to  beat  the  anti-Israel  drum  as  a  mark  of  solidar  ity.   Middle  East  issues  should  be  dis  cussed  honesdy,  but  the  Arab  contri  bution  to  tensions  should  be  subjected  to  the  same  level  of  scrutiny  as  will  inevitably  be  applied  to  Israeli  policies.

According  to  the  report,  Claus’  first  inkling  that  Judaism  was  his  new  intend  ed  path  was  when  he  was  unloading  a  particularly  heavy  bag  of  gifts  and  mut  tered  “Oy  Oy  Oy!”  instead  of  “Ho  Ho  Ho!""

Claus  sat  down  at  his  desk  in  the  North  Pole  and  itemised  the  benefits  of  bringing  toys  to  Jewish  children.   The  most  obvious  was  that  there  were  far  fewer  children  to  service  -  approximate  ly  three  million  Jewish  children,  as  opposed  to  500  million  Christian  children.   The  next  obvious  benefit  was  that  he  had  eight  days  of  Chanukah  in  which  to  deliver  all  the  gifts,  instead  of  jamming  the  entire  shipment  into  the  one  night  of  Christmas  Eve,  which  required  the  already  weary  Claus  to  travel  at  the  speed  of  light  to  accomplish  the  task.

While  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  has  publicly  welcomed  the  “road  map”  toward  Israeli-Palestinian  peace,  Elon,  the  tourism  minister,  was  making  the  rounds  blasting  the  “road  map”  and  offering  his  own,  radically  different  approach.

"  Saint  with  a  stained  past   KRON’S  VIEW   ;KSi   THE  intention  to  canonise  Queen  Isabella  —  synonymous  with  the  infa   mous  Spanish  Inquisition,  which  burnt  Jews  at  the  stake  for  adhering  to  their  faith  -  is  a  deeply  regrettable  move.   Protests  have  been  voiced  not  only  in  Jewish  quarters,  but  by  liberal  Catholics,  yet  they  have  effectively  fallen  on  deaf  ears  -  as  they  did  in  the  case  of  Edith  Stein,  the  nun  who  died  at  Auschwitz  as  a  Jew,  yet  was  canonised  as  a  Catholic  martyr  in  1998.  It  was  the  first  time  in  modern  history  that  a  Jew  ish-bom  person  had  been  made  a  saint.   Proponents  of  the  notion  cite  Isabella’s  role  in  spreading  the  Christian  faith  throughout  Latin  America  and  promoting  the  abolition  of  slavery  and  a  Spanish  cultural  revival.   That  may  be  so.  But  she  and  King  Ferdinand  also  presented  the  100,000  Jews  living  in  Spain  in  1492  with  the  ultimatum  of  converting  to  Catholicism  or  fleeing  the  country.  Those  who  chose  to  remain  Jewish  and  were  arrested  for  doing  so  were  branded  heretics  and  either  tortured  or  burned  to  death.   It  does  not  reflect  well  on  the  Catholic  Church  for  an  individual  with  such  a  stained  past  to  be  elevated  to  sainthood. ",2003-05-02

About  300  women  representing  almost  all  islands  and  NPA  communities  of  various  denominations  were  in  attendance  at  the  conference  held  at  Coconut  Island  from  Thursday  June  10  to  Sunday,  June  13,  2004.  The  theme  of  the  First  District  Women's  conference  'Sing  0  Barren'  was  based  on  Isaiah  54:  'Break  forth  into  singing  and  cry  aloud  Enlarge  the  place  of  our  tent.  Fear  not!  God  will  open  the  doors  For  the  women  he  has  called  to  rise  up,'  of  six  women  from  her  church.  Ms  Acraman,  a  powerful  preacher,  called  on  women  to  rise  up  and  become  who  God  uniquely  created  them  to  be.  Her  team  also  used  the  opportunity  to  share  emotionally  charged  and  beautiful  testimonies  concerning  how  God  had  touched  their  lives,  offering  delivering  them  from  lives  of  despair,  poverty  drug  and  alcohol  abuse.  Those  present  were  treated  to  vibrant  and  colorful  dance  and  song  performances,  which  reflected  their  unique  Maori  Culture.  In  presenting  their  musical  items,  the  Maori  women  encouraged  Torres  Strait  and  Aboriginal  women  to  not  abandon  their  culture  when  worshipping  God,  but  incorporate  their  own  unique  languages  and  dance  movements  in  praise  and  worship.  Each  church  represented  presented  musical  items,  which  ranged  from:  cymbal  dance  performances  to  language  praise  songs.  However,  many  would  agree  that  the  singing  of  Mrs.  Cecilia  Kebisu  from  Yam  Island  was  one  of  the  greatest  highlights  of  the  conference.  She  gave  a  spirit-filled   performance  of  a  song  she  finished  composing  over  the  weekend,  'Make  me  a  mighty  warrior.'  Local  women  were  also  encouraged  by  the  participation  in  the  conference  of  Fiona  Simpson  MP,  Shadow  minister  for  Transport  and  Main  Roads,  Urban  Planning  and  women's  policy  and  member  for  Maroochydore  who  took  time  out  of  her  busy  schedule  to  host  a  workshop  on  leadership.  Also  in  attendance  were  Christian  women  from  Brisbane  and  Caims.  The  manifesting  presence  of  the  Holy  Spirit  was  strong  and  ever-present  throughout  the  conference.  An  awesome  result  was  that  four  women  gave  their  hearts  to  the  Lord,  under  going  water  baptism  near  the  Coconut  Island  jetty.  The  community  of  Coconut  Island,  particularly  Pastors  and  Leaders  of  the  Poruma  AOG  worked  hard  to  ensure  all  women  were  accommodated  and  fed,  demonstrating  the  'good  pasin'  the  island  is  renowned  for.  In  order  to  reduce  the  load  on  Poruma  women  in  hosting  the  weekend,  Pastors  and  male  leaders  from  other  communities  also  gave  a  helping  hand,  demonstrating  'often  little  used'  skills  in  sandwich  making  and  washing  dishes.  Their  efforts  and  support  were  greatly  appreciated  by  all  present.  Ms  Acraman  told  the  conference  that  she  plans  to  return  next  year  with  a  different  team  of  Maori  women.  She  called  on  Torres  Strait  and  NPA  women  to  no  longer  rely  on  men  to  carry  out  ministries  in  the  church,  but  for  women  to  take  their  daughters  of  the  Most  High  God.  ""God  could  be  calling  some  of  you  to  be  Pastors  and  leaders  in  your  churches.  He  may  also  not  want  you  to  restrict  yourself  to  the  Torres  Strait,  but  may  be  calling  you  to  do  mission  work  in  other  parts  of  the  world.  You  must  ask  the  Lord  and  wait  on  how  he  wishes  to  use  you  as  a  vessel  for  his  work  in  the  field,""  Mrs.  Acraman  said.  *  The  Torres  News  will  be  publishing  photos  front  the  conference  during  the  next  two  weeks.

"  How  Christian  Britain  helped  make  Israel   BOOK  REVIEW   SOL  ENCEL   GOD,  GUNS  AND  ISRAEL   Jill  Hamilton   Sutton  Publishing,  $49.95   VIEWERS  of  the  television  adapta  tion  of  George  Eliot’s  novel  Daniel  Deronda  may  have  wondered  where  the  author  drew  her  inspiration  for  the  hero’s  intention  to  “give  a  political  existence  to  my  people,  making  them  a  nation  again”.   Hamilton’s  book  shows  us  how  widespread  were  such  ideas  at  the  time  (in  the  1870s),  so  that  they  formed  part  of  the  novelist’s  intellec   tual  and  social  milieu.   '  George  Eliot  herself  was  a  deeply   religious  person,  influenced  by  the  strongly  evangelical  Christianity  of  the  period.   Hamilton’s  book  reminds  us  of   some  striking  connections  between  the  evangelical  sects  and  the  birth  of   Israel.   In  1838,  a  group  of  missionaries  arrived  in  Jerusalem  with  the  aim  of  converting  “God’s  ancient  people”.   They  were  led  by  a  Scottish  preach  er,  Andrew  Bonar,  one  of  whose  com  panions  was  William  Wingate,  who  spent  many  years  as  a  missionary  in  the  East  End  of  *  London.   Almost  a  century  later  Andrew   Bonar’s  grandson,  Andrew  Bonar  Law  (prime  minister  in  1922-23)  was  a  member  of  the  British  War  Cabinet  which,  in  1917,  issued  the  document  known  forever  after  as  the  Balfour  Declaration.   Twenty  years  later  the  great-grand  son  of  William  Wingate,  the  soldier  Orde  Wingate,  was  instrumental  in  creating  the  Palmach,  the  commando  force  which  played  a   crucial  role  in  Israel’s  war  of   independence.   Hamilton  notes  that  the  Balfour   Declaration  was  produced  by  a  group  of  politicians  of  nonconformist  or  evangelical  backgrounds  for  whom  the  Old  Testament  had  been  a  major  formative  influence.  This  applied  to   seven  out  of  the  10  members  of  the  British  War  Cabinet.   It  was  as  if  “the  pages  of  the  Old   Testament  were  scattered  to  form  the   sections  of  a  temporary  bridge  between  Britain  and  the  Holy  Land”.   The  decisive  voice  in  the  British  War  Cabinet’s  deliberations,  which  lasted  throughout  1917,  was  that  of  the  prime  minister,  David  Lloyd  George.   IThe  Balfour  Declaration   was  produced  by  a   group  of  politicians  of  |  nonconformist  or   |  evangelical  backgrounds   |  for  whom  the  Old   I  Testament  had  been  a   j  major  formative  1  influence.   Lloyd  George,  himself  a  Baptist  lay  preacher,  once  remarked  that  he  pre   ferred  the  Old  Testament  to  the  New  Testament,  and  that  he  had  learnt  the  names  of  the  rivers,  valleys  and  mountains  of  the  Holy  Land  long  before  those  in  either  Wales  or  Eng   land.   Hamilton  herself,  or  more  proper  ly  the  Duchess  of  Hamilton,  was  born  and  brought  up  in  Australia,  where  she  worked  as  a  journalist  before  moving  to  Britain.   She  explains  that  her  interest  in  the  Middle  East  derives  from  her  father,  who  served  in  the  Australian  Light  Horse,  and  entered  Damascus  with  the  Australian  cavalry  just  a  few  hours  ahead  of  T  E  Lawrence  and  the  Emir  Feisal.   This  is  her  third  book  dealing  with  Middle  Eastern  history.  The  present  volume  addresses  the  conundrum  which  has  occupied  many  historians  -  how  and  why  did  Britain  find  it  expe  dient  to  create  a  Jewish  homeland  in  Palestine  within  the  British  Empire?   Although  her  fascination  with  the  role  of  the  “Christian  Zionists”  per  meates  the  book,  she  is  careful  not  to  overplay  this  theme,  and  concludes  that  it  was  the  combination  of  a  set  of  motivations:  Lloyd  George’s  attrac  tion  to  Weizmann’s  saying  that  Pales  tine,  like  Wales,  was  “a  little  mountainous  country”;  safeguarding  the  Suez  Canal;  the  protection  of  trade  and  empire;  the  pre-empting  of  French  claims  in  Palestine;  and  the  rallying  of  Jews  worldwide  to  the   Allied  cause.   Lloyd  George  once  remarked,  in  another  context,  that  the  politician  “must  grasp  the  future  while  it  is  molten”.  He  did  so  himself.  The  shape  of  the  present  Middle  East  crystallised   from  that  molten  mass.   Sol  Encel  is  emeritus  professor  of   sociology  at  the  University  of   New  South  Wales. ",2004-07-16
"  Undecided  Christian  signs  up  to  Salvation  Army  Reserve   UNCERTAIN  whether  to  join  The  Salvation  Army  full  time,  a  Melbourne  man  has  decided  to  trial  the  Christian  evangelical  movement  one  weekend  a  month,  two  weeks  per  year.  Lee  Bella,  24,  chose  to  join  the  Salvation  Army   Reserve  rather  than  the  main  corps  so  he  can  try  out  the  Army  lifestyle  without  giving  up  his  day  job.  ""I've  often  thought  about  joining  the  Army,""  Mr  Bella  said  yesterday,  ""but  I've  also  got  doubts.  For  example,  I  don't  know  if  these  days  the  whole  idea  of  a  Christian  militia  strikes  the  right  tone.  I  figure  the  Reserves  is  a  good  way  of  deciding  if  a  Christian  military  career  is  for  me.""

""I   think  I'll  do  OK  in  the  Spiritual,  but  the  Physical's  a  bit  of  a  worry,""  says  Bella,  whose  brother  was  discharged  from  the  Salvation  Army  two  years  ago  because  he  had  flat  feet.  If  he  becomes  a  Reserve,  Bella  will  spend  one  weekend  per  month  collecting  money  at  train  stations  and  being  inordinately  kind  while  dressed  in  absurd  military  regalia.  He  will  also  receive  training  in  how  to  solicit  donations  at  social  venues  like  pubs  by  making  customers  feel  guilty  for  enjoying  themselves.

"  From  Qld  with  love:  Christian   second-hand  support  for  Israel   ORYANA  KAUFMAN   A  GROUP  of  self-proclaimed  Christian  Zionists  living  in  Queensland  have  donated  almost  $250,000  to  Israel  over  the  last  10  years.   “I  have  been  interested  in   Israel  for  over  20  years.  I  went   to  Yad  Vashem  and  realised   there  were  non-Jewish  people  who  helped  during  the  Holo   caust.  I  wanted  to  show  the   people,  in  a  practical  way,  that  there  are  people  who  support  Israel,”  said  Rose   Toms.   Together  with  her  hus  band,  Maurice,  the  couple  are  part  of  a  group  of  more  than  60  people  on  the  Sunshine  Coast  who  raise  money  for  various  charities  in  Israel.  Much  of  that  comes  from  a   chain  of  successful  second   hand  stores  run  by  the  Toms.   The  group,  called  Kesher  Friends  of  WIZO,  also  have  several  other  second-hand  stores  on  the  Sunshine  Coast,  one  in  Hobart  and  another   west  of  Toowoomba.  They  also  have  plans  to  open  other   stores  in  Brisbane  and  Cooroy.   ""Our  group  on  the  Sun   shine  Coast  alone  raises  an   average  of  $20,000  a  year,”   Toms  said.   The  Toms  were  one  of  four  Kesher  Friends  of  WIZO   couples  who  attended  the   international  WIZO  confer  ence  held  in  Israel  earlier  this  year.   While  Suzanne  Tunstall,  the  president  of  the  Kesher   Friends  of  WIZO  in  Cairns,  hasn’t  been  to  Israel"",  she  thinks  she  may  be  of  Jewish  heritage.   “My  grandmother  comes  from  Holland  and  my  grand  father  is  Belgian.  A  rabbi  in  Melbourne  is  looking  up  our  family  names  to  find  out,”  she   said.   The  Cairns  group,  com  prising  some  16  people,  meets   once  a  month  and  raises   money  for  Israel  by  holding  fashion  parades  and  other  activities  throughout  the  year.   WIZO’s  federal  president,  Jo  Gostin,  said:  “The  Kesher  movement  has  been  a  tremendous  boost  to  WIZO.   “It’s  also  gone  beyond  fundraising.  We  appreciate   their  interest.” ",2004-11-26

"  Faith,  fundamentalism  and  antisemitism   VIEWPOINT   DAVID  KNOLL   There  is  no  engagement   to  be  had  with   fundamentalists,   whether  Christian  or   Muslim,  because  their   approach  to  religion  and  problem-solving  admits  only  of  absolutes.  For  such  fundamentalists  Jewish  precepts  are  necessarily  wrong.   Fundamentalism  and  anti   semitism  are  both  getting  a  lot  of  press  lately,  but  not  together.  They  should  be.  Here’s  why.   First,  Islamic  fundamentalism  needs  to  be  understood  in  order  to  be  dealt  with  effectively.  Last  month,  at  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  plenum,  Professor  Clive  Kessler  out  lined  the  differences  between  “gentle”  and  “ungentle  Islam”.   One  of  the  themes  that  Professor   Kessler  developed  was  that  only  a  minority  of  Muslims  engage  inclusive  ly  with  modernity.  For  with  moderni  ty  often  comes  a  commitment  to  respectful  pluralism  (also  known  as  multiculturalism),  which  allows  no  religion  or  race  any  mastery  over  any  other.  Ungentle  Islam  however  sees  itself  as  superseding  -  indeed  having  mastery  over  -  both  Judaism  and  Christianity.   To  much  of  the  Islamic  world,  Christianity  is  seen  as  a  compromised  monotheism,  and  the  persistence  of  Judaism,  having  been  once  superseded  by  Christ  and  then  superseded  by  Mohammed,  is  puzzling.  The  idea  that  in  a  pluralistic  world  each  religious   people  can  have  autonomy  but  not  mastery  over  the  others  is  a  concept  with  which  most  of  the  Islamic  world  is  ill  at  ease.   Meanwhile  “gentle  Islam”,  the  minority  version,  struggles  to  come  to  grips  with  the  concept  of  modernity  and  pluralism.  This  struggle  was  suc  cinctly  explained  by  Irshad  Manji  who  toured  Australia  recently  presenting   her  new  book  The  Trouble  with  Islam.  One  of  her  themes  was  that  Muslims  who  live  in  western  democracies  are   able  to  pursue  the  concept  of  jihad  and  survive  very  well  in  a  pluralistic,  dem  ocratic  environment.  Her  faith,  she  felt,  was  not  compromised  by  acknowledging  the  right  of  other  faiths  to  live  alongside  hers.  Manji  is  an  out  standing  intellect,  and  a  welcome  exponent  of  what  Professor  Kessler  would  call  “gentle  Islam”.   It  was,  however,  at  the  AGM  of  the  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  where  some  of  these  concepts  were  taken  beyond  any  particular  religion.  Dr  Simon  Longstaff  of  the  St  James  Ethics  Centre  was  the  keynote  speaker.  His  topic  was  “Faith  and  fundamental  ism”.  If  I  understood  Dr  Longstaff  cor   rectly,  his  thesis  was  that  people  of  faith  are  prepared  to  live  with  ambiguity  and  uncertainty,  and  therefore  are  willing  to  respect   human  difference  while   being  strengthened  in  their  particular  faith.  By  con  trast,  fundamentalists  allow  for  no  uncertainty  or  ambi  guity.  For  them  their  reli  gion  provided  absolute   answers  which  removed  uncertainties,  and  discon  nected  troubling  questions   from  their  lives.  For  a  fundamentalist   there  is  no  room  for  any  “other”  answer  to  life’s  most  difficult  questions.   If  faith  is  a  tool  for  managing  ambi  guity  and  uncertainty,  then  funda  mentalists  are  not  necessarily  people  of  faith.  Dr  Longstaff  thus  posed  a  chal  lenge  which  must  be  taken  up  by  all  faith  communities.  And  the  more  per  plexing  we  are,  the  more  it  is  essential  that  we  encourage  people  of  faith  to  engage  with  us.  In  Dr  Longstaff’s  model,  and  according  to  Professor  Kessler’s  prescription,  the  people  we  can  and  need  to  engage  with  are  those  who  are  comfortable  with  ambiguity  and  uncertainty  and  therefore  respect  ful  of  pluralism  and  modernity.   There  is  no  engagement  to  be  had  with  fundamentalists,  whether  Christ  ian  or  Muslim,  because  their  approach  to  religion  and  problem-solving  admits  only  of  absolutes.  For  such  fun  damentalists  Jewish  precepts  are  nec  essarilywrong.   Even  as  Christian  fundamentalists  and  Muslim  fundamentalists  will  not  agree  with  each  other,  because  each  of  them  will  not  admit  the  possibility  that   the  other’s  fundamentalism  warrants  respect,  both  will  agree  on  the  percep  tion  of  the  error  of  the  Jewish  way.   And  fundamentalists  do  not  have  to  be  labelled  religious  at  all.   The  anti-globalisation  movement  is  a  good  example  of  secular  funda  mentalism.  Mark  Strauss,  writing  in  Foreign  Policy  (November  2003),  wrote  an  outstanding  article  entitled  “Anti  globalism’s  Jewish  problem”.  He  reminds  us  that  deregulation  of  inter  national  economic  links  took  place  in  the  1980s  and  1990s,  and  resulted  in  selective  economic  growth.  Nations  that  deregulated  prospered  more  than   those  that  did  not.  Israel,  and  Jewish  business  interests  in  the  deregulated  new  world,  prospered.  The  Islamic  world  did  not.  Europe’s  economies  did  not  progress  or  prosper  as  quickly  as   the  United  States.   The  anti-globalisation  movement  asks  itself  rhetorically  “Where  are  Jews  the  strongest?”  They  answer:  “In  the   United  States  and  Israel.”  Then  anti  globalisation  activists  draw  a  correla  tion  and  indeed  a  causative  difference   between  nations  that  give  Jews  free  dom,  and  nations  which  have  pros  pered  “at  the  expense  of  others”.   Argues  Strauss:  “Throughout  the  Middle  East,  where  economic  growth  remains  stagnant  everywhere  but  Israel,  Islamists  and  secular  national  ists  alike  portray  globalisation  as  the  latest  in  a  series  of  US-Zionist  plots  to  subjugate  the  Arab  world  under  west   ern  economic  control  and  erase  its  cul  tural  borders.”   Anti-globalisation  activists  thus  engage  in  an  antisemitism  as  virile  and  fundamentalist  as  the  antisemitism  practised  by  Christian  and  Muslim  fundamentalists.  Thus  one  can  draw  out  that  a  great  threat  to  Jewish  free  dom  is  the  growth  of  fundamentalism.  There  is  no  such  threat  inherent  in  the  growth  of  respectful  faiths.   The  policy  lessons  are:  (i)  that  we  must  be  active  in  our  pursuit  of  plural  ist  western  democratic  values,  with  its  inherent  uncertainties,  and  (ii)  that  we  must  actively  build  our  alliances  with  serious  faith  communities,  while  care  fully  distinguishing  the  ungentle  from  the  gentle,  the  people  of  faith  from  the  purveyors  of  fundamentalism.

"  SYDNEY   WEEK  IN  THE  COMMUNITY   The  universal  language   .Music:   What  can  be  achieved  when   you  cross  a  Muslim  Indonesian  percussionist,  two  Christian   performers  from  New  Zealand   and  a  melodious  Jewish  couple?  A  musical  extravaganza  that  crosses  cultural  boundries  to  find  ""Common  Ground"".   ORYANA  KAUFMAN  reports.   MUSIC,  it  is  said,  has  the   power  to  cross  cultural  barriers  and  communi  cate  without  words.   And  Sydney  musician  Judy  Campbell  understands  the  power  of  music  as  well  as  anybody.   A  singer-songwriter  and  direc  tor  of  the  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel  choir,  Campbell  together  with  saxophonist  husband  Mark  Ginsburg  formed  world-music  jazz  band  Mosaic  as  a  ""model  for  unity  in  diversity"".  The  group  also  com  prises  guitarist  James  Muller,  per  cussionist  Nicholas  McBride,  vocalist  Justine  Bradley,  Gerard  Masters  on  piano  and  bassist  Brett  Hirst.   This  month  Mosaic  launches  their  debut  CD,  Common  Ground,  following  their  return  from  a   three-week  South  African  tour,  performing  at  the  ""Viva  Madiba""   celebration  of  Nelson  Mandela's  86th  birthday  in  Cape  Town  and  at  the  National  Arts  Festival,  where  they  played  with  an  Indigenous  African  choir.   ""It's  about  drawing  disparate  information  together  into  some  thing  greater  than  the  sum  of  all  parts  and  achieving  that  in  a  space  called  common  ground,""  says  Campbell,  46.   Having  emigrated  from  Cape  Town  to  Sydney  in  1982,  Campbell  says  the  trip  has  rein  forced  her  connection  with  Africa.  Adorned  in  bright  beads  and  African  plaits,  she  sported  a  new  look  to  prove  her  point.   A  highlight  of  the  trip,  says  Campbell,  was  being  able  to  mix   musicians  and  styles  and  find  the  ""common  ground""  she  speaks  of.   ""We  invited  young  South  African  musicians  to  perform  at  the  jazz  and  blues  festival.  Some  of  them  hadn't  played  with  foreigners  before.""   For  Campbell  it  was  a  fine  line  between  ""trying  to  facilitate  a  collective  experience  and  coming  across  as  patronising.   ""You  see  the  village  where  they  come  from  and  then  you  pick  them  up  and  put  them  in  a  glam  orous  club  with  cocktails  and  money  floating  around.  You  have  to  be  sensitive  about  how  you  do   it.   ""But  they  had  a  great  time.  One  14-year-old  boy  from  the  township  of  Langa  [on  the  out  skirts  of  Cape  Town]  was  offered  a   permanent  position  in  a  band.""   Together  with  American  com  poser  Shelley  Olson,  Campbell  co  produced  the  CD  A  Chanuka  Cantata,  dedicated  to  peace  in  Jerusalem  and  around  the  world.  It  led  to  an  invitation  to  perform  at  the  White  House  in  2000.   Next  week,  four  members  of  Mosaic  will  be  joined  by  Muslim  Indonesian  percussionist  Deva  Permana,  for  a  performance  at  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel  called  ""Musicians  speak  their   minds"".   The  event  is  designed  to  bring  together  different  musical,  nation  al  and  ethnic  traditions.   Permana,  31,  from  Java,  will  play  a  traditional  drum  called  a  kendang.   CONTINUED  UFE  4   Music:  the   universal  language   CONTINUED  FROM  UFE1   ""Not  many  Indonesian  artists  or  musicians  have  the  chance  to  play  their  music  and  mix  with  other  kinds  of  Australian  music.  They  are  often  limited  to  only  playing  within  their  community,""  he  says.   ""It's  not  because  they  don't  want  to  mix.  It's  often  because  they  don't  have  the  chance,  or  they  have  the  belief  that  Indonesian  and  western  music  can't  work  together.""   At  the  NSTE  function,  says  Campbell,  ""We  will  be  talking   about  how  we  feel"".   ""Music  acts  as  a  unifying  force  and  it  is  a  good  model  for  unity  and  diversity.  In  our  days,  when  peace  and  harmony  seem  to  be  increasingly  elusive  commodities,  musicians  of  conscience  are  pooling  their  talents  to  promote  peace  and  harmony.""   Film  footage  from  the  Mosaic  tour  of  South  Africa,  including   sessions  with  children  in  the  townships  of  Langa,  Guguletu  and  Khayelitsha,  will  be  shown.   ""Musicians  speak  their  minds""  will   be  held  at  NSTE,  on  Sunday  November  14,  at  7.30pm.  The  event  is  a  part  of  the  ongoing  ""I  speak  my  mind""  series  of  evenings   devoted  to  social  action  issues,   organised  by  NSTE's  Jews  for   Social  Action  group. ",2004-11-05
"  INTERFAITH  MEETING  CALLS  FOR  HARMONY   LEADERS  of  Australia's  Jewish,  Christian  and  Muslim  communities  forged  their  commitment  to  living  in  harmony  at  a  meeting  in  Sydney   last  month.   Mounting  tensions  in  the  Middle  East,  particularly  following  the  assassination  of  Hamas  founder  Sheikh  Ahmad  Yassin  last  month,  prompted  the  leaders  to  meet  at  Sydney’s  Zetland  Mosque.

In  a  joint  statement,  leaders  of  the  three  organisations  said:  “We  call  on  all  Australians  to  make  pos  itive  choices  for  peace  and  to  refuse  to  resolve  issues  by  the  use  of  violence.   “In  light  of  our  commitment  to  live  in  peace,  no  acts  of  violence  or  attacks  against  ethnic  or  religious  communities  are  acceptable  in  our  community.   “We  should  instead  take  posi  tive  actions,  building  on  the  strong  relationships  we  already  have.

"  Jews  for  Jesus  plans   move  to  Bondi  Junction   ORYANA  KAUFMAN   JEWS  for  Jesus,  a  Christian  mission  ary  group,  is  planning  to  move  its  national  headquarters  to  Bondi  Junction.   The  group,  currently  based  in  an  Anglican  Church  in  Paddington,  is  currently  negotiating  shop-front  premises  in  the  junction,  an  area  heavily  populated  by  Jews.   Jews  for  Jesus  is  an  international  organisation  which  believes  Jesus  is  the  Messiah.  It  aims  to  convert  Jews  through  aggressive  advertising  cam  paigns  such  as  cold-calling  Jewish  sounding  names  in  the  telephone  book  and  handing  out  flyers.   “We  are  expanding  our  premises  and  plan  to  open  a  bookstore  where  people  can  come  and  sit  and  read  or  enjoy  a  coffee,”  said  Jews  for  Jesus  national  director  Bob  Mendelsohn.   “More  and  more  of  our  respon   dents  come  from  the  eastern  sub  urbs  and  it  made  sense  to  move  to  where  our  constituency  is,”  he  said.   But  Cult  Counselling  Australia  director  Raphael  Aron  warned  the  Jewish  community  to  be  on  guard.   “During  the  past  year,  we  have  been  involved  with  an  increasing   number  of  families  who  have  been   taken  in  by  missionary  groups,”  Aron  said.  “Apart  from  the  influence   these  missionary  groups  have  on  travelling  Israelis,  there  appears  to  be   a  concerted  effort  to  draw  Russian   immigrants  into  their  organisation  ”   The  Sydney  branch  of  Jews  for  Jesus  opened  in  1998.  It  plans  to  launch  a  campaign  in  Melbourne   next  year.   The  organisation  can  be  traced  back  to  San  Francisco  in  the  early  1970s.  Today,  according  to  its  web  site,  it  is  an  international  outfit  with  more  than  200  employees  in  11   countries.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  David  Knoll  said:  “The  board  and  entire  community  of   NSW  consider  the  activities  of  the   Jews  for  Jesus  misleading  and   offensive.   “They  play  on  the  most  vulnera  ble  in  our  community  and  in  partic   ular  those  who  do  not  have  a   grounding  in  Judaism  and  who  are  easily  misled.   “It  is  essential  that  everyone  in  the  community  be  vigilant  and  let  the  board  know  of  the  activities  of  Jews  for  Jesus  and  members  of  the  community  who  it  is  felt  may  have  been  taken  in  by  their  thinly  dis  guised  attempts  to  convert  Jews  to  Christianity.”   To  report  missionary  activity  call  the   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies   (02)  9360  1600.

"  Warning  as  Jews  for  Jesus  steps  up  campaign   ALANA  ROSENBAUM   JEWS  for  Jesus,  the  evangelical  Chris  tian  group  that  targets  Jews  for  conversion,  claims  to  have  enticed  60  Sydney  community  members  during  a  three-week  proselytising  campaign  that  is  set  to  be  repeated  in  Melbourne  next  year.   In  December,  the  organisation  that  casts  Jesus  as  the  Messiah  stepped  up  efforts  to  gain  converts  by  advertising  in  the  media  and  calling  Jewish-sound  ing  names  in  the  telephone  book.   The  Jews  for  Jesus  website  hailed  the  “Behold  Your  God”  campaign  a  success,  claiming  to  have  received  inquiries  from  five  dozen  Jews  during  the  three-week  period.   Jews  for  Jesus  drew  the  ire  of  Syd  ney’s  Jewish  leadership  last  year  when  the  missionary  group  placed  full-page  advertisments  in  Sydney  newspapers.   One  technique  was  to  call  Jewish  sounding  names  in  the  telephone  book  and  offer  to  send  a  copy  of  Sur  vivor  Story  -  a  Jews  for  Jesus  publica  tion  that  features  a  Holocaust  survivor  who  embraced  Jesus.   The  organisation  claimed  to  have  handed  out  146,025  gospel  tracts  dur  ing  its  three-week  campaign.   Sydney’s  Jewish  community  responded  to  the  initiative  by  alerting  rabbis  and  corresponding  with  organisations  that  had  agreed  to  host   Jews  for  Jesus  speakers.

"  Columnists   ASK  THE  AMERICAN   Have  you  been   with  Christian  Brimo   Q.  Do  you  have  the  Simpsons  in  America?  A.  No.  On  their  own,  you  Australians  managed  to  come  up  with  an  incredibly  funny  series  featuring  intelligent  social  commentary  on  Americans  and  America,  then  forgot  to  show  anybody  else.  Watching  this  ""Simpsons""  for  the  first  time  has  been  one  of  my  rare  pleasures  in  this  harsh,  unforgiving  land.  Q.  Do  you  have  TVs  on  your  food?  A.  Yes.  Food  in  America  is  specially  modified  to  create  colonies  of  hyperintelligent  microorganisms,  thus  giving  us  Yanks  a  semblence  of  an  ""inner  life""  (we're  very  literal  minded  people).  To  keep  these  microorganisms  ocupied  between  book  drops,  our  nanoengineers  have  created  tiny  TVs,  loaded  with  PBS  (our  version  of  SBS)  and  Woody  Allen  movies  (the  New  York  version  of  Crocodile  Dundee  movies).  If  we  don't  swallow  this  ""TV  food""  (we're  also  unimaginative)  once  a  month,  we  get  indigestion.  Q.  Have  you  been  shot?  A.  Yes.  I'd  just  stolen  a  Hemi  Cuba   and  used  it  to  run  down  some  cops.  They  cornered  me  and  shot  at  the  car.  I  jumped  out  and  peppered  them  with  shots  from  my  gat,  but  I  was  out  of  bullets.  Punching  proved  ineffective,  and  I  soon  woke  up  in  the  local  hospital.  Luckily,  I  knew  the  All  Weapons'  cheat  and  flamed  their  big  blue  asses  with  a  backpack  full  of  napalm.  Q.  Doesn't  everyone  watch  wrestling  in  America?  A.  As  far  as  I  know,  most  of  my  fellow  Americans  are,  indeed,  slack  jawed  idiots  who'll  gape  at  any  mindless  violence  that  presents  itself  on  their  cathode  ray  tubes.  If  you're  asking  whether  I  watch  wrestling...  no.  My  preferred  homoerotic  entertainment  is  American  football  (or  ""wimp  football"")  Q.  Do  you  want  to  help  overthrow  the  American  empire?  (I  was  actually  asked  this  by  someone  who  didn't  know  I  was  American—true  story!)  A.

If  you're  an  average  Windows  user,  you're  probably  going  to  install  some  games  and  new  wallpaper,  but  leave  everything  else  untouched.  You'll  use  Outlook  Express  for  mail,  Internet  Explorer  for  web  browsing,  Microsoft  Office  for  schoolwork,  Windows  Media  for  movies  and  music,  and  your  favourite    messengers  to  talk  to  your  friend.  Good?  No'.  Default  Windows  applications  are  fine,  if  you  don't  mind  your  computer  slowing  down  every  time  you  write  a  document  while  listening  to  music,  or  having  to  type  in  Google's  web  address  every  time  you  want  to  run  a  basic  search.  But  there  are  better  options  out  there,  and  many  of  them  are  free  and  easy  to  use.  Everything  in  this  article  comes  with  these  guarantees:  they're  free,  somebody  with  no  knowledge  of  programming  can  use  them,  and  they  do  their  jobs  better  then  the  stuff  they  replace.

Second,  there's  the  Search  Bar,  which  lets  you  search  from  any  site,  Google,  Download.com,  Amazon.com,  E-  Bay,  and  various  other  useful  sites.  Just  type  in  your  search,  hit  ""enter"",  and  you'll  be  taken  to  the  site  and  the  results  you  want.  It  saves  lots  of  time  that  can  be  better  spent  reading  search  results.  The  other  instantly-useful  feature  is  a  built-in  pop-up  blocker.  Just  go  to  Preferences  then  Quick  Preferences,  and  you  can  turn  off  those  ads  that  pop  up  when  you  try  to  view  other  sites!  Turn  on  ""Open  Requested  Pop-  Ups  Only"",  and  you'll  never  have  any  pop  up  problems  while  browsing.  It  requires  none  of  the  fiddling  that  you  usually  need  for  pop-up  killers,  and  it's  one  less  program  to  clutter  up  your  computer.  Other  cool  stuff  includes  ""tabbed  browsing—you  can  open  multiple  pages  in  one  window,  and  switch  between  them  instantly;  the  ability  to  start  each  time  with  whatever  pages  you  were  viewing  last  time;  a  way  to  set  pages  to  reload  automatically  (great  when  you're  checking  your  uni  webmail);  a  handy  Download  Manager;  skins  that  let  you  change  its  appearance;  and  lots  of  other  features.  The  only  fault  I  can  find  is  that  it  doesn't  download  new   versions  automatically.  There's  also  the  occasional  crash,  but  it's  not  as  bad  as  Windows  and  never  data  threatening.  Spybot  Search  and  Destroy  spybot.safer-networking.de  For  all  the  cool  stuff  Opera  does,  it  still  lets  in  ""spyware""  (programs  that  track  your  movements  through  the  Internet  and  send  that  info  to  scary  people)  and  ""adware""  (programs  that  deliver  ads  straight  to  your  computer).  To  kill  them,  use  a  little  program  called  Spybot:  Search  and  Destroy.  It's  completely  free.  All  it  does  is  search  your  computer  for  these  programs  and  ask  if  you  want  to  kill  them.  If  you  say  yes,  it  kills  them  and  even  ""immunises""  your  computer  against  them.  It  works  very  well,  and  you  should  notice  a  speed  increase  after  you've  cleared  all  that  crap  (and  there  will  be  a  lot  of  crap,  especially  if  you  visit  a  lot  of  porn  sites).  No  real  disadvantages  that  I  can  see.  If  it  was  evil,  I'm  sure  I  would  have  heard  about  it  somewhere.  Trillian  www.ceruleanstudios.com  At  this  point,  you're  probably  going  to  want  to  brag  to  your  friends  about  your  cool  new  browser  and  lack  of  porn  ads.  But  unless  you've  got  all  your  friends  on  one  service,  that  means  opening  AOL  Instant  Messenger,  Yahoo  Messenger,  IRC,  ICQ,  MSN;  in  effect,  lots  of  programs.  Trillian  exists  to  let  you  connect  to  all  five  services  simultaneously.  That's  all  it  does.  It  still  has  some  bugs;  for  example,  I've  had  trouble  transferring   files  over  AIM.  But  if  all  you  want  to  do  is  chat,  it's  a  great  way  to  save  time  and  desktop  space.  It  also  has  a  fully  customisable  appearance.  iTunes  www.apple.com  This  isn't  a  recommendation.  It's  a  fact.  Open  up  Opera  and  download  iTunes.  If  you  haven't  downloaded  Opera  yet,  open  up  IE,  download  iTunes,  and  then  download  Opera.  ITunes  is,  as  Apple  president  Steve  Jobs  said,  ""the  best  Windows  app  ever"".  Although  it  was  designed  for  Apple,  it  was  recently  converted  to  Windows;  it  was  downloaded  over  one  million  times  in  its  first  three  days  of  release.  iTunes  stores,  plays,  organises,  rips,  and  burns  music  quickly  and  easily.  You  can  search  all  your  songs  or  browse  by  album  or  artist.  One  button  burns  a  playlist  to  CD  and  the  same  button  rips  a  CD  to  your  hard  drive.  You  can  make  custom  playlists  at  the  touch  of  a  button  or  just  randomise  your  entire  collection.  You  can  listen  to  a  great  selection  of  included  Net  radio  stations  (I  like  Dr  Yo)  or  add  your  own.  It  takes  up  very  little  space  when  it's  running  and  the  shiny  Mac  design  will  make  your  Windows  desktop  look  pretty.  Apple  has  pioneered  a  wildly  successful  system  where  users  can  buy  mp3s  through  iTunes.  Over  50  million  mp3s  have  been  bought  from  iTunes  since  December,  at  just  US99c  per  song.  Rumour  has  it  that  this  feature  will  soon  be  available  in  Australia.  If  you  have  an  iPod  (the  best  portable   music  player  ever),  you  can  use  iTunes  to  update  it.  And  it's  free.  After  I  downloaded  this,  I  listened  to  twice  as  much  music  in  half  the  time  and  had  more  fun  doing  it.  If  you've  got  a  Windows  computer  and  a  good  pair  of  ears,  there  ""s  no  excuse  for  not  downloading  iTunes.  It'll  make  you  slightly  less  jealous  of  your  Mac  using  friends.  OpenOffice.org  www.openoffice.org  Open  Office  is  a  free  program  similar  to  Microsoft  Word.  It  runs  faster  than  Word,  offers  the  same  options  and  crashes  much  less—what  a  bargain.  Also,  there's  no  Clippy.  No  annoying  paper  clip  thing.  And  it's  not  made  by  Windows,  so  it  doesn't  take  up  so  much  space.  I  see  no  reason  to  go  back  to  Word,  but  I  can't  see  a  compelling  reason  to  switch  to  it  other  than,  ""It's  not  Windows"".  I'm  including  it  here  mostly  because  I'd  feel  odd  not  including  the  program  that  I  used  to  type  this  article.  On  the  downside,  I  wish  the  spell  check  would  recognise  URLs;  it  even  flagged  its  own  homepage  as  a  typo.  Still,  it's  small  and  good  and  a  full  review  will  come  when  I've  used  more  of  the  features.  Editors'  note:  If  you're  on  the  Mac  platform  (like  Tharunka),  you  won't  have  any  default  Windows  applications  to  get  rid  of,  so  don't  be  miffed  you're  not  covered  in  this  article.  OpenOffice.org  for  Mac  isn't  ready  yet:  most  users  should  give  the  'X11'  Mac  version  a  wide  berth  for  now.   Consume ",2004-04-05
"  German  Christians  produce  documentary  to  highlight  upsurge  of  antisemitism   AVIVA  BARD   A  GERMAN-based  Christian  organi  sation  has  produced  a  one-hour  doc  umentary  on  antisemitism  with  the  intention  of  screening  it  to  Jewish  and  non-Jewish  audiences  around  the  world.   Produced  by  Johannes  Facius,  a  member  of  the  International  Fellow  ship  of  Intercessors,  Lest  We  Forget  was  created  out  of  concern  over  the  rise  of  antisemitism  in  Muslim  nations  and  European  countries  in  recent  years.   “We  are  seeing  an  increasing  fer  vour  by  those  who  seek  to  either  deny  or  minimise  the  reality  of  the  Holo  caust  perpetrated  by  the  Nazis,”  Facius  said  in  Sydney  last  week.   “There  is  a  concerted  campaign  in  many  Arab  countries,  both  through   their  state-run  media  and  education   systems,  to  dehumanise  the  Jewish  people  and  delegitimise  the  State  of   Israel.”   Filming  began  at  Auschwitz  in  December  2002  and  the  documen  tary  includes  interviews  with  sur   vivors  of  the  Nazi  death  camp  as  well  as  with  family  members  of  people  killed  in  terrorist  atrocities  in  Israel.   “We  believe  there  is  a  clear  and   present  danger  to  Jewish  people  around  the  world,  including  in  Israel,”  said  Facius,  who  was  inspired  to  take  action  after  September  11.   Facius  was  six  and  living  in  Copenhagen  when  World  War  II  broke  out.  His  father,  a  Christian  minister,  was  a  member  of  the  Resis  tance,  “who  took  it  upon  themselves  to  help  Jews  escape  the  Gestapo  and   the  SS”.   “The  reason  I  have  taken  it  on  myself  to  make  this  production  is  not  just  because  of  what  my  father  did,”  Facius  said.  “Any  German  person  has  to  acknowledge  the  greatest  crime  inflicted  on  the  Jewish  people  in  his  tory,  only  65  years  ago.”   In  Germany  the  film  has  been  shown  in  Munich,  Rosenheim,  Reut  lingen,  Freiburg,  Frankfurt  and   Hanover.   Travelling  to  Israel  four  times  a  year,  Facius  said  he  intends  to  take  his  message  “more  widely  into  the  Chris   Documentary  producer  Johannes  Faclus   tian  Church  to  demonstrate  that  this  is  a  real  issue”   “With  the  Christian  Church  facing  the  rise  in  tide  of  antisemitism,  will  it  again  keep  silent?” ",2004-05-28

"  VIEWPOINT   ADAM  FALUDI   SOME  people  ask  me,  ""what's  Shnat  like?""  But  I  can't  describe  what  it  has  done  for  me.  For  someone  who  graduated  from  a  Christian  boys'  school  and  had  no  real  association  with  Israel,  Shnat  has  changed  my  point  of  view  on  so  many  levels.   Shnat  Hachshara  (year  of  preparation)  is  a  program  for  high  school  graduates,  who  have  been  at  youth  movements,  to  discover  Israel  by  living  and  working  there.   I  went  on  Shnat  as  a  member  of  Hineni  Australia  to  experience  Israel,  learning  as  much  as  possible  so  I  could  take  my  experiences  back  to  the  movement  I  have  been  part  of  for   many  years.   Now  nine  months  of  the  program  have  passed  and  only  five  weeks  remain  until  the  program  ends.  It  has  been  a  life-changing  experience.   When  I  descended  the  plane  at  the  start  of  the  year  with  my  group,  I  remember  the  Birthright  experience  guide  saying  ""welcome  home"".  From  that  moment  I  knew  I  belonged  in  this  country.   We  began  the  Shnat  year  with  a  two-week  crash  course,  visiting  all  the  usual  Israeli  tourist  spots.  While  it  was  annoying  to  spend  so  much  time  trav  eling  from  place  to  place  on  a  bus,  the  bonds  of  friendship  that  were  made  have  remained  throughout  this  year  in   Israel.   The  following  part  of  the  program  -  the  Machon  L'Madrichei  Chutz  La'Aretz  (Institution  for  Youth  Leaders  From  Abroad)  course  -  was  the  most   From  left  Adam  Steinberg,  Aaron  Wagen,  Jeremy  Nagel.   substantial  part  of  my  Shnat  year.   Living  in  the  Yitzhak  Rabin  Youth  Hostel  in  Jerusalem,  we  attended  classes  that  covered  topics  ranging  from  Hebrew,  Judaism  and  Jewish  history  to  Zionism  and  hadracha  (leadership  training).  Throughout  the  four  months  of  the  program  we  took  various  trips  around  Israel.   Our  classes  were  taught  by  incredi  ble  teachers  and  the  madrichim  were  helpful.  All  the  Australian  and  interna  tional  youth  movements  were  present  there.  Machon  was  a  time  for  all  of  us  to  come  together  and  learn,  so  that  we  could  return  and  educate  our  chanichim  (movement  members).   The  next  half  of  my  Shnat  year  was  spent  with  my  Hineni  group.  We  began  with  an  options  period,  where  I  volunteered  on  an  army  base  in  the  Sarel  program.  Following  that,  we   began  our  stint  at  Kibbutz  Lavi.   Living  on  the  kibbutz  was  a  great  experience,  where  we  worked  picking  fruit  the  fields,  helping  in  the  kibbutz  hotel  or  lending  a  hand  completing  other  odd  jobs.   The  Jewish  Learning  Seminar  we  completed  after  our  kibbutz  period,  opened  our  eyes  to  new  concepts  of  Jewish  thinking  and  practice.   Now  we  have  arrived  in  the  south  ern  city  of  Yeroham  for  the  final  part  of  the  Shnat  program.  We  will  be  volun  teering  here  in  the  development  town.   I  strongly  urge  any  person  who  finishes  school  and  wants  to  take  a  year's  break  prior  to  university,  to  come  on  Shnat  and  experience  Israel  the  way  it  is  supposed  to  be  experi  enced  -  by  living  it.

"  Chabad  multicultural  program  wins  award   ORYANA  KAUFMAN   WHEN  a  Jew,  a  Christian  and  a  Mus  lim  visit  schools  as  part  of  the  Chabad  House  Goodness  and  Kindness  pro  gram,  very  often  the  kids  can’ttell  who  is  who,  according  to  Rabbi  Nochum  Schapiro,  director  of  Chabad  House   of  the  North  Shore.   On  Tuesday  night  the  multicultur  al  program,  which  visits  14,000  students  in  115  schools  across  NSW  spreading  messages  of  peace  and  harmony,  won  a  prestigious  government  award.   At  a  gala  dinner  hosted  by  NSW  Premier  Bob  Carr,  the  Goodness  and  Kindness  program  received  the  NSW  national  multicultural  marketing  award  from  the  Community  Relations   Commission.   “The  Goodness  and  Kindness  pro  gram  is  about  hope,  faith  and  vision.  Hope  for  a  better  tomorrow  -  where  people  all  over  the  world  from  diverse  backgrounds  and  ethnicities  can  live  together  in  harmony”  Rabbi  Schapiro   said.   “It  is  a  frith  in  die  inherent  good  ness  of  man  ...  revealed  through  acts  of  kindness  combating  and  ultimately  getting  rid  of  cruelty,  terror  and  evil”   Congratulating  the  three  partici  pants,  Stepan  Kerkyasharian,  chair  of  die  commission,  said:  “This  image  of  a  Christian,  Muslim  and  Jew  comfort  ably  together  in  front  of  a  class  room  is  a  powerful  one  which  breaks  down  stereotypes  and  demonstrates  that  we  can  all  work  together  as  Australians  to  accomplish  a  peaceful  and  progressive  society”   Rabbi  Zalman  Kastei  (left)  and  Rabbi  Nochum  Schapiro  whose  Goodness  and  Kindness  program  won  a  national  award  on  Tuesday  night.

"  More  than  just  a  game   by  Christian  Brfmo   Every  Friday  night,  I  walk  into  a  little  room  in  the  Quad  and  for  4  hours  I  pretend  to  be  somebody  else.  Two  weeks  ago,  it  was  a  single  mother  out  in  the  Arizona  desert  protecting  her  10  year  old  son  from  an  implacable  serial  killer.  Last  week...well,  last  week  the  game  was  cancelled,  so  we  swapped  stories  of  bad  games  and  worse  teachers,  stopping  sometimes  to  play  a  card  game  or  some  Heroclix.  This  is  the  UNSW  Gameplayers  Club,  and  we'd  prefer  you  don't  call  us  'Dungeons  and  Dragons  nerds'.  The  Gameplayers  Club  is  based  on  equal  parts  storytelling  and  competition.  Every  Friday  and  Wednesday  (plus  Tuesday  Bridge  Nights,  organised  conventions,  and  side  games  run  by  members)  a  motley  group  gathers  and  then  splits  up.  Around  half  go  for  more  'interactive  fiction'  or  traditional  role-player  games  (RPGs)—stuff  like  Dungeons  and  Dragons,  Vampire:  The  Masquerade,  and  Unknown  Armies.  These  involve  pretending  to  be  someone  else  in  some  sort  of  scenario,  usually  fantastic  or  historical.  It's  great  fun  and  not  at  all  creepy,  being  equal  parts  acting,  writing,  and   chance.  A  character  may  die  on  a  bad  dice  roll  or  describe  a  scene  so  well  the  other  players  are  laughing  and  applauding.  Half  the  players  (and  everyone,  during  downtime)  plays  stuff  like  checkers,  chess,  Mah  Jong,  Monopoly,  card  games  and  tactical  war  gamestraditional  games  of  skill  and  chance.  There  are  some  oddball  games,  of  course,  such  as  the  Red  Dwarf  RPG  card  game,  which  involves  collecting  heads  in  the  French  Revolution.  They  also  play  longer  games  such  as  table-top  wars,  and  sometimes  they  hold  video  nights  and  ghost-story  nights.  A  good  time  is  usually  had  by  all.  The  Gameplayers  Club  is  very  inclusive—if  you  don't  know  how  to  play  a  game  (and  I  hadn't  before  I  joined),  just  ask  and  the  rules  will  be  explained  and  demonstrated  in  a  very  nice  way.  It's  quite  relaxing,  too,  as  all  the  troubles  of  the  real  world  disappear  in  the  thrill  of  living  out  a  fictional  life  or  tricking  your  best  friend  with  a  well-placed  tactical  gambit.  As  mailing  list  moderator  Tanith  says,  'Anyone  who  wants  to  roleplay  should  come  along  on  a  Friday  night,  whether  they  know  anything  about  it  or  not.'   The  Gameplayers  Club  meets  at  7pm  every  Wednesday  (Quad  G040)  and  Friday  (Morven  Brown,  G06).  Mention  Tharunka  and  Chris  will  give  you  some  munchies.

"  Christians  urged  to  distance  themselves  from  The  Passion   ALANA  ROSENBAUM   CHRISTIAN  leaders  should  speak  out  against  Mel  Gibson  s  portrayal  of  Jews  in  The  Passion  of  the  Christ,  a  State  Zionist  Council  of  Victoria  representative  declared  last  week.   Addressing  the  Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victoria,  Sam  Salcman  said  the  Australian  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  should  take  a  stronger  stance  against  the  film,  which  has  been  charged  with  instigating  anti   semitism.   “I  would  like  to  see  the  international  coun   cil  coming  out  strongly  ...  we  in  Australia  should  be  in  the  lead  in  making  such  state  ments,”  Salcman  said.   In  a  statement  to  media,  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  said:  “While  in  some  quar  ters  the  film’s  trial  scenes  are  interpreted  as  a  return  to  the  discredited  canard  that  Jews  were   responsible  for  Jesus’  death,  the  council  sees  the  film  as  a  path  to  reconciliation  of  the  faiths.”   The  statements  fell  short  of  branding  the  film,  which  re-enacts  the  final  12  hours  of  Jesus’  life,  as  antisemitic.   B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commis  sion  chairman  Dr  Paul  Gardner  said  while  The  Passion  may  inflame  European  anti  semitism,  it  is  unlikely  to  have  the  same  effect   in  Australia.   Before  its  release,  Dr  Gardner  urged  the  community  to  react  responsibly  to  the  film  or  risk  another  Hanan  Ashrawi  affair  -  in  which  Jewish  leaders  were  blasted  for  lobbying  against  the  Palestinian  leader’s  receipt  of  the  Sydney  Peace  Prize.   The  debate  over  the  film  was  re-ignited   Sam  SaEcman...  called  on  Christian  leaders  to  distance  themselves  from  the  film.   after  Michael  Cohen  an  executive  member  of  the  Australian  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews,  addressed  the  plenum.   “I  know  many  Jews  are  fearful  of  dialogue  with  Christians,”  he  said.   “But  bear  in  mind  that  since  1942,  the  Chief  Rabbis  of  the  United  Kingdom,  rabbis  [Joseph  Herman]  Hertz,  [Israel]  Brodie,  [Immanuel]  Jacobovitz  and  [Jonathan]  Sacks,  have  all  been  presidents  of  the  council.”   He  said  that  while  the  Council  of  Chris  tians  and  Jews  has  entered  into  dialogue  with  Muslims,  it  is  doubtful  that  the  organisation  could  ever  represent  the  three  monotheistic   faiths.   Islam,  he  said,  would  be  a  late  addition,  and  “there  may  always  be  a  feeling  of  them  being  not  quite  equal.” ",2004-03-19
"  What  the  fuck  is  up  with  America?  ASK  THE  AMERICAN   by  Christian  Brimo   I  was  good  enough  to  get  some  actual  questions  this  edition,  thanks  to  the  wonderful  folks  at  the  UNSW  Gameplayers  Club.  I'm  going  to  answer  their  questions  semi-seriously  this  week,  though  I'd  appreciate  it  if  they  don't  get  mad  when  I  suggest  that,  when  playing  American  characters,  they  don't  use  words  like  ""torch""  ""thong""  and  ""ginger  beer"".  (The  first  two  have  entirely  different  meanings  in  the  States.  The  last  one  simply  doesn't  exist.)  Q.  What  the  fuck  is  up  with  America?  A.  I  have  two  brothers,  and  the  youngest  one  is  ten  years  younger  than  I  am.  He  feels  threatened  by  all  the  older  people  in  the  house,  so  he  screams  and  laughs  a  lot,  plays  with  toy  fighter  jets,  and  basically  makes  a  bunch  of  trouble.  He  doesn't  mean  any  harm—he's  just  trying  to  make  some  space  for  himself.  He  acts  like   he's  wise,  though,  and  like  he  knows  what's  going  on—always  bossing  his  siblings  around  in  a  funny  ""adult""  voice.  He's  a  lot  like  America  that  way.  It's  young  and  silly  and  messed  up,  but  it  thinks  it's  got  important  things  to  say  and  can  boss  everybody  around.  In  America's  case,  though,  its  parents  felt  sorry  for  it  and  gave  it  some  military  power  with  which  to  play.  And  then  my  tidy  analogy  turns  into  that  episode  of  Twilight  Zone  with  Bill  Mumy,  where  all  the  adults  do  whatever  the  little  kid  wants  because  he  has  horrible  powers  and  nobody  wants  to  be  turned  into  a  Jack  in  the  Box  or  sent  into  the  cornfield.  Q.  Why  do  Americans  sound  the  way  they  do?  A.  Er...  do  you  fail  to  realise  exactly  how  big  America  is?  ""Americans""  don't  even  sound  like  Americans—  we  sound  like  Long  Islanders,  New  Yorkers,  Texans,  Georgians,  and  everything  in  between.  Trust  me,  a   Southern  accent  sounds  just  as  odd  to  me  as  it  does  to  you.  Thinking  we  all  sound  the  same  is  as  dumb  as  thinking  a  Sydneysider  sounds  like  Paul  Hogan.  Q.  Does  America  have  50  or  52  states?  A.  Neither.  There's  Confusion,  Derision,  Missuria,  the  South,  New  York,  Walla  Walla,  Puerto  Rico,  Australia,  the  New  Hebredies,  Istanbul,  Chesapeake  Bay,  Minnesota,  Florida,  and  East  Carolina.  That,  with  the  24  I  don't  know,  makes  38  states.  Sounds  about  right.  Q.  When  will  democracy  be  reinstated  in  the  USA?  A.  No  citizen  of  a  country  that  lets  the  Green  Party  gain  actual  power  has  the  right  to  tell  me  anything  about  democracy.  Q.  Do  you  think  you're  better  than  the  UN?  A.  I'm  a  single  individual  who  can   make  important  decisions  without  the  need  for  bureaucratic  waffling,  pancaking,  and  general  French  Toasting  that  the  UN  goes  through  for  everything,  so  yes,  I  am  better  then  the  UN.  Also,  my  proclamations  carry  about  the  same  weight.  Q.  Do  Americans  love  Krispy  Kreme?  A.  Er.  Would  ""an  intense  combination  of  lust,  religious  devotion,  and  wholesale  gluttony""  be  defined  as  love?  Probably.  Speaking  in  all  seriousness,  Krispy  Kreme  donuts  are  the  greatest  things  on  Earth.  My  cynicism  fails  me  as  I  sing  their  praises,  and  I  can  only  hope  my  unbridled  devotion  causes  them  to  send  Tharunka  (or  me  personally)  a  free  box.  Q.  What  is  the  LA  hockey  team  called?  A.  The  Mighty  Ducks.  Disney  created  a  real  team  after  the  movie.  Unfortunately,  they  weren't  based  on  the  short-lived  cartoon  series,  and  so   they  lack  the  ability  to  shoot  rocket  propelled  pucks  from  their  gloves  at  alien  invaders.  Q.  As  a  member  of  a  nation  that  spent  40  years  involved  in  a  Cold  War  with  Russia,  do  you  consider  it  a  personal  failure  that  certain  manipulative  Russian  women  are  alive?  A.  No.  I  consider  it  a  personal  failure  that  my  good  looks  and  inappropriate  comments  have  failed  to  win  over  the  bodies  of  certain  manipulative  Russian  women  and  their  giant,  armoured  vodka  bears.  Were  I  to  succeed,  the  benefits  would  no  doubt  outweigh  the  costs  of  failure.  And  while  I  fail,  I  fail  nobly,  knowing  I  face  an  enemy  that  bested  Napoleon,  confounded  Chekhov,  and  held  Reagan  at  bay  for  40  years.  So  no,  I  do  not  regret  my  grievous  errors,  which  lead  to  the  loss  of  the  Cold  War.  Rather,  I  welcome  our  new  female  Russian  overlords,  and  hope  I  can  serve  them  well  in  any  footstool  or  doormat-related  position.

"  SUPANOVA  CONVENTION   Advice  from  the  masters,  and  not  much  weirdness   by  Christian  Brimo   ""Always  stick  to  your  deadlines.    I'm  six  months  ahead  on  mine,  which  gives  me  the  freedom  to  work  on  the  projects  I  want.    If  you're  late,  you  cost  the  publisher  money  and  get  them  pissed  off.    And  there's  800  people  behind  you  who  want  your  job  and  can  do  it  in  half  the  time  and  twice  as  well.""  Brian  Michael  Bendis,  writer  of  Marvel  Comic's  ""Ultimate  Spider-  Man,""  ""Ultimate  Avengers,""  ""Daredevil,""  and  ""Powers""  (cop-  drama  with  superheroes),  should  be  speaking  at  college  campuses  instead  of  comic  book  cons.    When  I  saw  him  at  Saturday's  Supanova  Pop  Culture  Expo  (an  annual  convention  dedicated  to  all  things  geeky,)  he  was  brimming  over  with  friendly  advice  for  writers  of  all  types.  ""To  write  realistic  dialogue,  always  listen  to  how  people  talk.    It  drives  my  wife  crazy  -  she'll  be  telling  me  a  story,  and  she'll  know  I'm  not  listening  to  what  she's  saying.    I'm  listening  to  how  she's  saying  it.    It's  so  fascinating  listening  to  how  you  Australians  pronounce  words.""  Commonsense  advice,  but  it  had  the  force  of  coming  from  a  man  who  writes  some  of  the  world's  most  recognizable  characters  (and  wins  awards  doing  it).    Bendis,  bald-  headed  and  friendly,  talked  like  a  man  who  genuinely  loves  his  job  and  his  fans.    He  repeatedly  made  reference  to  the  legions  of  Internet  geeks  who  follow  his  every  move,  attacking  him  for  decisions  he  makes  or  chatting  with  him  on  his  message  board.    He  reads  what  they  say,  but  he  doesn't  follow  it  blindly;  as  he  said,  ""you'll  never  make  everybody  happy,""  and  this  is  especially  true  in  the  world  of  comics.  The  panel  was  informal,  and  many  of  the  questions  lead  to  bits  of  comic  book  insider  knowledge.    The  best  involved  Sony  purchasing  the  movie  rights  to  ""Powers.""  The  especially  liked  an  issue  guest-starring  Warren  Ellis,  another  comic  writer.    For  six  months  they  argued  that  they  would  not  make  the  movie  without  the  character;  Bendis  argued  for  six  months  that  the  Ellis  was  a  real  person,  and  could  not  actually  be  owned  by  a  movie  company.    It  was,  eventually,  settled,  at  great  expense  and  great  humor.  Other  movie  news  included  his  impressions  of  the  upcoming,  Spider-  Man  2:  ""It's  great.    I  was  worried  after  the  first  movie  they'd  make  it  all  action.    It's  not.    It's  a  Peter  Parker  movie,  not  a  Spider-Man  movie.    The  new  cinematographer  is  awesome,  too,""    and  his  agreement  with  the  accepted  opinion  on  the  Spider-Man  and  Daredevil  movies  (""Spider-Man  was  awesome,  Daredevil  wasn't  nearly  as  good"").   Of  all  the  big  names  at  Supanova-  George  Takai,  Star  Trek's  Mr.  Sulu;  David  Carradine  from  ""Kung  Fu:  The  Legend  Continues""  and  ""Kill  Bill;""  various  voice  actors  and  special  effects  techs  -  Bendis  seemed  most  in  his  element.    He  was  a  nice  guy,  sharing  gus  enthusiasm  for  what  he  loved.  He  signed  as  many  comics  as  people  wanted  and  offered  encouragement  on  this  article  (having  a  minor  idol  promise  to  read  something  you  wrote  is  a  nice  feeling.)    But  above  all,  he  gave  advice  for  writers  (and  editors)  to  live  by:  ""If  you  think  it's  perfect,  then  there's  something  wrong.    It's  just  done.""  And,  once  again,  ""Stick  to  your  deadlines.""  Elsewhere  at  Supanova  Held  at  Sydney's  Pier  8,  the  Supanova  Pop  Culture  Expo  was  far  from  the  sweaty  nerdfests  often  portrayed  on  TV.    It  was  basically  a  large  grid  of  vendors  representing  half  the  comic  book  shops,  movie  stores,  and  game  companies  in  Australia,  all  selling  merchandise  and  often  offering  ""special  guests""  (have  you  ever  wanted  to  meet  the  artist  of  ""Killeroo,""  Australia's  best  comic  about  a  tough  talking  kangaroo?  Now  you  can!)  and  free  stuff.  One  arcade  sponsored  a  Dance  Dance  Revolution  contest;  I  did  not  participate,  but  from  the  glance  I  got  it  did,  indeed,  have  many  people  skilled  at  jumping  around  on  small  arrows.    I've  never  failed  to  be  impressed  at  the  skill  of  DDR  players,  but  I  had  bigger  vidgame  fish  to  try;  previews  of  ""Star  Wars;  Battlegrounds!""  ""Star  Wars;  Battlegrounds,""  coming  soon  for  the  PC,  PS2,  and  XBox,  is  LucasArts  attempt  to  combine  the  gameplay  of  ""Battlefield  1942""  (you're  in  a  war.    You  can  get  in  vehicles.    You  can  fight  outher  people.    It  is  fun)  with  Star  Wars.    In  the  bits  I  played,  I  was  an  Imperial  Storm  Trooper  on  Yavin  4,  shooting  at  rebels,  wondering  where  the  Ewoks  were,  and  jumping  in  the  cockpit  of  unwielding,  two-  legged  walkers.    After  getting  lost  in  the  forest,  I  switched  to  the  sandy  world  of  Tatooine,  where  I  used  a  sandspeeder  to  kill  Sand  People  in  the  attempts  to  win  Sandy  back  from  Danny.  Er,  wrong  movie.    But  the  Sand  People  are  notable  in  being  a  neutral  side;  as  far  as  I  can  tell,  they  fight  you  off  until  you  capture  their  command  point;  then  they  help  you.    It's  something  not  found  in  Battlefield  1942  and  it  does  add  another  strategic  layer.  The  controls  took  some  getting  used  to,  with  the  view  over-the-shoulder  view  and  an  annoying  camera  causing  some  people.    The  game  was  only  80  per  cent  done,  though,  and  the  gameplay  did  seem  clean,  bug-free,  and  full  of  the  best  parts  of   Battlefield  1942.    It  benefited  from  the  Star  Wars  Effect,  which  goes  as  follows:  ""If  something  is  a  little  bit  fun,  adding  Star  Wars  to  it  will  make  it  much  more  fun.""    Hitting  your  brother  with  a  cardboard  tube?  Fun.    Hitting  your  brother  with  a  cardboard  tube  painted  blue,  while  you  make  lightsaber  noises?    Much  more  fun.    Playing  with  a  bunch  of  your  friends  to  fight  off  the  Germans  using  tanks  and  spitfires?    Pretty  damn  fun.    Playing  with  a  bunch  of  friends  to  fight  off  the  Rebels  in  AT-  AT  Walkers  and  TIE  Fighters?    A  childhoold  dream  come  true.  Speaking  of  Imperials,  they  were  the  most  visible  costumed  people  at  the  convention.    No  overweight  Klingons,  lots  of  teenagers  in  anime  costumes  (specifically,  lots  of  cute  girls  in  Catgirl  and  Sailor  Moon  costumes),  and,  wandering  through  the  Con,  some  very  elaborate  Imperial  Royal  Guards  (the  ones  in  read,)  Storm  Troopers  (the  one  in  white),  and,  er,  ""Storm  Troopers  who  dress  in  black  with  gasmasks  and  look  really  cool.""  Now  that  I  think  about  it,  they  may  have  been  hired  by  LucasArts  to  help  promote  ""Star  Wars:  Battlegrounds,""  a  tactic  of  which  I  heartily  approve.  They  didn't  say  much.    They  just  marched  and  looked  good.  So  yes,  the  weirdness  was  at  a  minimum.    There  were  people  selling  homemade  comics  (""zines""),  a  contingent  from  the  UNSW  Anime  Club  (whom  I  didn't  interview  because  I  didn't  realise  I  was  writing  this  article  until  I  got  home,)  and  miles  of  people  playing  collectible  card  games.    There  were  goths,  freaks,  nerds,  and  people  who  looked  normal  until  you  realised  they  were  giving  panels.  Mr.  Sulu  was  there,  as  was  Bill  and  and  orc  from  Lord  of  the  Rings.  Hugo  Weaving  was  not  there;  I've  been  told  by  many  people  how  local  and  approachable  he  is,  but  I  suppose  it  makes  sense  he  would  want  to  avoid  the  worst  sort  of  fans.    Still,  having  somebody  who  had  a  major  part  Lord  of  the  Rings  and  The  Matrix  would  have  saved  them  from  having  to  get  Orc  Number  3  and  ""Ghost,""  and  would  have  been  a  big  thrill.    It's  strange  that  I  have  a  better  chance  seeing  Agent  Smith  at  Berkelouw  Books  then  I  do  at  a  sci-fi/fantasy  convention;  but  them's  the  breaks.  Still,  a  wonderful  time  was  had  by  all.    There  were  autographs  to  get,  people  to  talk  to,  and  minor  stars  at  which  to  gawk.    I  got  two  copies  of  ""Ultimate  Spider-Man""  signed,  let  my  geekiness  wander  free  for  a  day,  and  realised  just  how  many  sci-fi,  anime,  and  fantasy  fans  there  are  in  Sydney  -  and  how  normal  many  of  us  look.    I  look  forward  to  seeing  you  all  there  next  year,  and  may  the  Force  by  with  you. ",2004-05-10

"  16  of  the  best  short  films  in  Australia   by  Christian  Brimo   Went  to  Tropfest,  a  free  outdoor  film  festival.  Thought  it'd  be  a  little  thing.  100,000  people  showed  up,  as  well  as  a  bunch  of  local  celebrities  I'd  never  heard  of:  Selma  Hayek  and  Nightcrawler  (er,  Alan  Cumming.  Not  dressed  up  as  Nightcrawler,  but  I'm  still  kinda  geeky,  hence,  Nightcrawler).  16  of  the  best  short  films  in  Australia.  I  liked  them  all.  The  fan-voted  winner  was  a  very  sweet  animated  film  called  Yin  about  two  ""Yin""  halves  of  a  Yin-Yang  that  fell  in  love.  If  I  were  an  ad  person,  I'd  describe  it  as  a  ""wordless  allegory  about  homosexual  love"",  only  I  don't  like  calling  it  an  allegory,  since  it  works  beautifully  on  its  own  terms.  Everyone  else  agreed.  The  judge-voted  winner—Moneyinvolved  a  guy  about  to  be  murdered  by  the  mob,  being  saved  by  a  call  from  Who  Wants  to  be  a  Millionaire.  It  was  an  odd  little  concept,  well-told.  I  liked  it.  Played  perfectly  straight,  not  as  a  joke:  you  felt  the  tension.  Second  place  went  to  My  Life  as  an  Animation,  which  looked  like,  and  probably  was,  one  of  those  foul-   mouthed  Flash  movies  you  find  on  the  net.  A  guy  asks  his  animations  how  they  liked  their  lives.  My  favourite  response  was  from  an  animated  guy  only  sketched  from  the  waist  up:  ""If  I  had  a  dick,  I'd  tell  you  to  suck  it"".  Not  great  art,  but  funny  as  hell,  and  it  was  neat  seeing  something  like  that  on  a  very  big  screen.  My  personal  underdog  champion—  the  film  I  felt  attached  to,  though  I  loved  Yin  so  very  much—was  10  Down,  about  a  man  doing  a  crossword  puzzle  that  slowly  starts  to  predict  his  life  in  odd  and  subtle  ways.  I've  always  had  a  soft  spot  for  these  sorts  of  things,  and  it  had  an  appropriately  nasty,  Twilight  Zone-style  twist.  Since  some  of  the  films  had  horribly  nasty  twists  that  didn't  fit  the  tone,  and  one  had  a  twist  that  wasn't  ironic  at  all,  it  was  nice  to  see  a  twist  that  was  both  ironic  and  fit  the  genre.  It  won  best  editing,  though.  Other  highlights  included  a  story  of  a  15-year-old  girl  wishing  God  would  give  her  breasts,  and  instead  getting  her  first  period.  It  was  a  bit  awkward,  but  well-acted;  half  the  audience  could  relate,  I  guess,  and  even  I  could   get  behind  the  awkwardness  she  felt.  Won  best  actor.  There  was  also  a  film  called  Little  Women,  where  the  police  are  called  by  a  guy  whose  wife  has  left  him,  only  to  find  the  house  filled  with  miniature  items,  all  designed  for  a  very  small  wife.  There  were  also  two  sponsored  movies.  The  first  was  Mullet,  a  mock-Bollywood  musical  by  Absolut  Vodka  about  a  hairdresser  in  India.  This  was  funny,  heartwarming,  full  of  songs,  and  in  Indian.  It  may  have  been  disrespectful,  but  most  of  the  cast  and  crew  were  Indian,  so  I  doubt  it.  The  vodka  bottle  was  worked  in  very  subtly—wallpaper  patterns,  Bindis  and  so  on.  It  worked  as  an  ad  'cause  it  reminded  me  to  buy  that  book  of  Absolut  print  ads.  (I  don't  drink  vodka,  so  I  think  of  Absolut  as  a  company  that  makes  funky  ads).  The  second  sponsored  movie  was  for  the  Ford  Fiesta  and  was  directed  by  last  year's  winner.  It  revolved  around  a  boy  being  followed  home  by  a  Ford  Fiesta,  and  becoming  good  friends  with  the  car,  until  the  evil  owner  tried  to  claim  him! ",2004-03-08

Are  you  Canadian  ?  A.  Err...yes.  I  am  Canadian.  No  Americans  here.  Nope.  Nobody  here  but  us  servants  of  the  British  empire.  I'm  a  good  socialist,  just  like  you,  comrade!  No  need  to  beat  me  up  for  my...err...America's  horrible  imperial  policies!  Q.  Ask  the  American,  I  love  your  hat.  Do  you  pull  lots  of  chicks  with  that  hat?  (Note:  Ask  the  American  wears  a  straw  Akubra  fedora  everywhere.)  A.  Yes.  It  reminds  them  of  thengrandfathers,  and  all  their  Electra  complexes  involving  hot,  sweaty,  wrinkle  sex  just  come  out  in  a  torrent  of  energy  and  passion.  And  once  I  pull  out  my  gold  dentures,  well,  let  me  just  sr.v,  I  haven't  slept  in  eight  days,  and  it's  not  'cause  of  school  deadlines.  Q.  Are  you  a  'theatricalperson'?  A.  Yes,  meaning,  even  if  I  was  gay,  as  Whether  it's  about  watery  beer  or  Old  S  write  to  him  directly  at  cbrimo01@simo   this  hat  and  woman's  coat  indicate,  I  would  not  go  out  with  you,  as  you  are  not  wearing  Buddy  Holly  glasses  and  do  not  have  red  hair.  Also,  you're  not  David  Bowie  in  Labyrinth.  Q.  You're  an  American?  Really?  I'm  from  Texas/the  Midwest/the  South.  Can  we  be  best  buds?  A.  Ever  hear  of  guilt  by  association?  You've  got  5  minutes  to  prove  you've  got  the  intelligence  of  a  garden  slug  or  I'm  calling  security  to  kick  you  dirty,  gun-loving  confederates  out  of  the  campus  and  out  of  my  face.  Q.  Are  you  here  on  a  student  visa?  A.  Nope.  My  Dad,  a  noted  anti-  McDonalds  terrorist,  fled  the  country  after  defrauding  Apple  out  of  $USl  million.  Sick  of  people  saying  'if  you  hate  this  place  so  much,  leave',  he  packed  his  family  into  a  van  and  drove  across  the  Atlantic  Ocean,  taking  us  to  a  magical  land  of  jackaroos,  larrikins  and  two  Starbucks  per  citv,  as  opposed  to  two  Starbucks  per  block.  Q.  Do  you  miss  America?  A.  Yes,  and  she  gave  me  herpes...  damn  bitch.  Q.  Not  'did  you  fuck  Miss  America  ?'  but  'Do  you  miss  your  homeland?'  A.  Of  course.  I  can't  wait  to  get  back  to  scum  filled  beaches  that  cost  10  parky,  ask  your  question  by  emailing  us  ns-rock.edu.  He  speaks  English.   bucks  to  bathe  in,  $6.50  an  hour  minimum  wage,  no  free  healthcare,  and  idiots  from  Australia  calling  us  'capitalist  pigs'.  Living  in  close  proximity  to  several  major  rap  stars  is  another  plus.  Q.  What  did  you  think  of  the  new  planetarium  that  opened  in  New  York's  Natural  History  museum?  A.  I'll  let  my  ex-New  Yorker  friend  answer  this.  'Ugh,  it  makes  me  so  mad.  Nothing  was  to  scale,  and  if  it  was  to  scale,  I  can't  understand  it.  They  should  have  made  it  simpler,  or  better.  They're  so  much  stuff  they  could  have  spent  the  money  on,  those  damn  capitalistic  bastards.  I  hope  they  rot  and  die  in  hell!  ARRRRRGGGGHHHHHHH!'  Q.  Why  are  you  charging  me  $5.50  for  a  bottle  ofToohey's  Extra  Dry?  A.  I  work  at  Darling  Harbour,  and  my  boss  needed  someone  without  a  heart  to  extort  money  from  well-meaningtourists.  I  gain  their  trust  with  my  American  accent,  then  sucker-punch  them  with  high  prices  and  bad  wine.  Q.  Why  do  you  hate  America  so  much  ?  A.  Same  reason  I  hate  my  parents—  they  give  me  tons  of  cool  shit,  but  don't  let  me  do  my  own  thing.  Also,  they  talk  funny  and  don't  know  the  meaning  of  irony.  at  tharunka@guild.unsvv.edu.au,  or ",2004-03-22
"  Features   Columnists  ASK  THE  AMERICAN  Transvestite  hookers,  hos,  plastic  surgeons,  squirrels  and  New  Jersey   with  Christian  Brimo   Q.  How  do  I  get  on  Springer?  A.  It  is  well  known  that  gentlemen  prefer  blondes,  and  Jerry  Springer  is  nothing  if  not  a  gentleman.  In  order  to  get  ""on""  him,  you  must  first  submit  a  convincing  application  for  his  show.  Hit  all  the  usual  bases—you're  an  overweight  transvestite  hooker  who's  cheating  on  your  stepbrother  with  your  stepson.  Recruit  local  carnival  freaks  to  play  those  parts  (the  audience  will  need  somebody  to  boo)  and  get  a  stand-in  to  play  you  in  the  text  video.  When  you  are  invited  in  for  the  taping,  wear  an  elegant,  lowcut  suit,  and  blonde  hair  dye.  Show  an  interest  in  Springer's  career  as  a  politician  (eg  mayor  of  Cincinnati,  Senate  candidate)  and  express  contempt  at  the  guests  he  parades  out  for  the  public's  amusement.  Things  should  move  from  there...he's  a  liberated  man,  so  he  shouldn't  mind  you  being  on  top.  Q.  Can  I  get  on  all  the  American  talk  shoxas?  A.  Write  a  sordid  tell-all  about  your  affair  with  Springer;  if  it  evolves  into  marriage  write  a  spirited  defence  of  him.  Murray  Povich  and  the  others  will  pump  you  for  info  on  your  husband;  Oprah  will  probably  condemn  you;  Jay  Leno,  David  Letterman,  Conan  O'Brian,  Jon  Stewart  (and  any  hosts  I've  missed  while  stuck  in  this  godforsaken  land)  will  make  jokes  about  you  and  maybe  invite  you  on  the  show.  If  you  trash  Springer  you  may  get  invited  back   so  his  audience  can  trash  you;  if  you  do  not  you  might  make  co-host,  producer,  or  manager.  If  Springer  is  already  married,  stage  a  catfight  with  his  ""ho""  of  an  ex-wife.  Q.  Is  it  best  to  get  plastic  surgery  in  America  or  Mexico?  A.  After  your  whirlwind  romance  with  Springer  ends,  you  may  need  to  dodge  the  horde  of  maddened  fans  howling  for  your  blood/sex/  interviews.  While  American  plastic  surgery  is  safer,  Mexicans  are  a  bit  cheaper  about  it...  and  you  might  not  have  any  money  left  if  Springer  made  you  sign  a  good  pre-nup.  Make  sure  you  bring  your  own  disinfectant  and  make  sure  they  don't  take  ""plastic""  too  literally—you  don't  want  to  go  back  on  Springer  as  ""Mary  the  Barbie  Doll  Lady"".  That  would  be  a  bit  too  grotesque.  Q.  How  do  Americans  feel  about  squirrels?  (I'll  let  my  colleague  Iain  answer  this  one):  ""Quick  squirrels!  Quick  in  the  mouth.  Definably  quick  in  the  mouth.  Quick,  nimble  little  monsters.""  Translation:  We  likes  the  squirrels,  good  for  eating,  yessss,  my  preccciouuussss,  yessssss.  Fast,  quick  squirrels!  Pounce!  Q.  Where  is  New  Jersey,  anyway?  I've  told  you  already—8th  Circle  of  Hell,  near  the  strip  malls,  rest  stops,  and  mall  prostitutes.  (Note:  I  was  born  in  New  Jersey.  So  was  Frank  Sinatra.  And  the  One  True  Love  of  My  Life.  So  don't  flame  me!  Geez.)   Whether  it's  about  watery  beer  or  Old  Sparky,  you  can  ask  the  American  your  questions  by  emailing  us  at  tharunka@guild.unsw.edu.au,  or  write  to  him  directly  at  cbrimo01@simons-rock.edu.

"  Our  language  is  important   ?   ?   My  comments  primarily  is  in  regard  to  the  Christian  church  here  in  the  T.S.  and  also  generally  every  Islander  who  will  be  attending  the  2004  Cultural  Festival.  My  campaign  is  broadly  Bible  translation  and  naming  our  Creole  language!  I  know  it's  an  excellent  opportunity  for  the  church  and  especially  the  prophets,  apostles,  pastors,  teachcrs,  and  evangelists  who  are  attending  this  festival  need  to  acknowledge  that  we're  in  emergency  in  need  of  the  bible  in  our  own  traditional  dialects  including  the  Creole!  Because  English  is  not  our  communicator  but  Creole  is!  If  the  body  of  Christ  is  not  in  function  to  do  this  important  work  then  God  will  use  the  next  generation.  The  same  with  the  five-fold  ministry  because  they  are  not  equipping  saints  for  this  work  then  the  ministry  cannot  see  and  hear  therefore  cannot  not  understand  the  need  for  translated  scriptures.  I  believe  it  is  a  promise  from  the  God  of  heaven  and  earth  whose  name,  the  Lord  that  his  lost  sheep  of  Israel,  descendants  of  Abraham  here  in  the  Straits  need  to  hear  the  words  of  Jesus  Christ  in  our  languages.  Now  to  the  T.S.  community  attending  the  festivities,  is  it  important  time  right  now  to  name  our  beautiful  language  of  Creole?  If  we're  afraid  or  apathetic   then  God  will  call  it  by  name!  It  is  a  fact  the  Creole  or  (Yumpla  Ailan  Tok)  is  the  mediator  between  the  cultures  of  PNG  through  T.S.  to  Australia  aborigines  and  coincidcntly  it  is  a  language  in  its  own  right  blessed  by  the  Lord.  Because  after  all  everything  come  from  lord  which  is  a  gift  including  the  word  of  Jesus  Christ  in  our  languages!  Kind  regards   Percy  Mi  si,  Thursday  Island.   Support  for  Big  Daddy  T  Some  people  might  say  that  I  am  biased  to  support  the  writing  of  Big  Daddy  T  in  the  Torres  News,  because  he  is  a  fellow  Mcriam  man  and  relative.  Putting  that  aside,  BDT  has  created  a  wide  following  and  I,  for  one  flip,  to  his  or  Bishop  Mabo's  article  (another  relative),  before  reading  the  front  page.  His  articles  hit  home  and  I  would  say  that  a  very  great  number  of  Torres  Strait  Islanders  support  his  comments.  If  the  minority  don't  like  what  they  read,  it's  because  of  the  guilt/inferiority  complex  or  that  the  colonialist  mentality  is  alive  in  the  Torres  Strait.  Big  Daddy  T  keep  pumping  out  those  comments.  I  thank  the  Torres  News  Publisher/Editor  for  having  the  faith  to  endorse  printing  your  column  every  week.  To  those  who  have  doubts  about  your  articles,  I  leave  them  with  a  proverb  from   Shakespeare:  ""Our  doubts  are  traitors.""   Jim  Akee,  Mer   and  lifestyle  Please  know  that  this  message  is  not  to  point  a  finger,  but  only  to  bring  about  general  awareness,  as  a  hope  and  prayer  for  change  to  a  better  blessed  life  for  some  at  least,  where  sadly  it  will  not  happen  for  all.  The  Truth  is:  (whether  the  world  believes  it  or  not,  it  does  not  matter  but)  -  God  Most  High  (of  the  Bible)  crcated  all  things  good,  for  a  moral  good  from  His  perspective,  and  for  our  blessing  from  Him  when  we  live  His  way  of  His  requirements  for  us,  because,  being  God  the  Creator  and  God  the  Sovereign  Judge,  He  will  bring  about  His  will  to  satisfy  His  purpose  (Eccl  .12:14),  when  the  time  comes,  which  is  very  SOON  (how  SOON?  The  10  world-government  nation  of  Dan.ch.7  &amp;  ch.2.  is  about  to  take  place;  the  forming  of  the  European  Union  is  the  beginning  of  the  fulfillment  of  this  Bible  Prophecy),  So  it  is  not  the  will  of  mankind  that  matters,  but  the  will  of  a  HOLY  God,  and  we  must  live,  and  encourage  one  another  to  live  and  grow  in  accordance  to  His  will  for  us,  just  for  our  general  good,  i.e.  for  the  good  of  our  nation,  society,  family  and  for  ourselves.  In  matters  to  do  with  gay   marriages/lifestyles,  it  is  an  act  opposite  to  the  moral  requirements  of  a  HOLY  God  of  Heaven,  the  Creator  of  all  life  as  we  know  it  (Gen.chs.l  &amp;  2),  that  upon  it  being  legally  approved  (nationally/  internationally)  and  applied  and  put  into  effect,  will  bring  about  known  and  unknown  sickness  and  disease  worldwide  (Dt.28:15-68).  Any  actions  that  does  not  agree  and  follow  God's  direction  for  God's  righteousness  way  of  living,  will  automatically  bring  about  curses  upon  the  individual;  the  family;  the  society;  and  upon  the  nation  as  well  (if  it  comes  under  legal  national  Governmental  approval).  We  have  and  are  already  experiencing  worldwide  outbreak  of  extreme  evil  as  well  as  sickness  and  disease  and  even  natural  disasters  in  a  greater  scale  then  we  have  ever  known  before,  and  it  is  increasing  and  will  continue  to  increase,  and  the  reason?  ....you've  guessed  it,  the  breaking  of  God's  Divine  moral  Law  (Rom.l  :24-32).  But  through  all  this,  may  God  be  the  strength  of  His  Holy  life  and  living  for  those  who  look  to  Him  for  help,  and  by  His  compassionate  and  merciful-power,  save  those  who  are  caught  up  in  ignorance  and  unbelief.

"  History  of  antisemitism  misses  the  mark   BOOK  REVIEW   VERARANKI   ANTISEMITISM:  MYTH  AND  HATE  FROM  ANTIQUITY  TO  THE  PRESENT   Marvin  Perry  and  Frederick  Schweitzer  Palgrave  Macmillan,  $63   FOR  two  milleniums,  anti-Jewish  sto  ries  were  part  of  Christian  teachings.  In  modernity,  antisemitism  has  served  to  simplify  and  explain  com  plex  and  confusing  issues,  injustices  and  experiences.   The  historic  continuity  and  cul  tural  presence  of  falsehoods  make   them  obvious  and  axiomatic.   Currently  we  are  living  through  the  third  wave  of  antisemitism  in  the  West  since  the  Holocaust.  Each  time  there  were  voices  labelling  it  the  “new  antisemitism”.   This  time,  although  the  essence  of  antisemitism  -  hatred  of  Jews  -  did  not  change,  the  “new”  epithet  is  not  just  academic  or  political  sensationalism.   New  on  the  scene  is  Islamofascism,  which  uses  historical  strands  of  hatred,  each  with  its  own  strong  cul  tural  resonance,  blood  libel,  Holo  caust  denial,  the  sinister  figure  of  the  Talmud  Jew,  the  czarist  fabrication  of   the  Protocols,  the  revolutionary  Jew  and  the  exploitative  capitalist,  the  per  verter  of  culture  and  the  colonialist.   To  these  already  existing  and  cul  turally  absorbed  myths,  Islamofascism  keeps  adding  new  ones  (the  canard  of  the  Jenin  “massacre”  and  Mossad  as  the  perpetrator  of  September  11).   These  new  myths  reignite  the  hatred  of  Jews  in  western  political  culture.  The  new  politically  correct  respond  with  eager  credulity  and   acceptance.   A  “canard”  is  an  untrue  piece  of   news,  a  false  information  or  a  baseless  rumour.  Over  time  it  becomes  a   myth.  Most  antisemitic  myths  started  as  canards.  The  longer  the  history,  the  more  the  myth  gets  built  into  culture.   Continuity  and  persistence  of  these  tales  become  their  proof  of  validity  and  makes  them  self  evident.   ISo  how  is  this  book   about  antisemitism   different  to  other  books  on  antisemitism?   1  Alas,  it  isn't.   Muslim  antisemitism  fuses  feudal  Christian  religious  images,  the  Nazi  amalgamation  of  anti-modern,  nationalist,  racist  antisemitism,  polit  ically-correct  anti-Israeli  hatred  and  populist  anti-Americanism.   Many  books  deal  with  antisemitism  through  the  ages,  such  as  Robert  Wistrich’s  Longest  Hatred  or  Leon  Poli  akov's  History  of  Antisemitism.   So  how  is  this  book  about  anti  semitism  different  to  other  books  on  antisemitism?  Alas,  it  isn’t.   It  focuses  on  the  already  known,  documented,  explained  clusters  of  antisemitic  myths.  Sadly,  the  most   important  new  development,  namely  Muslim  antisemitism  and  its  usage  of  old,  and  wholesale  manufacture  of  new  myths  (with  the  help  of  the  west  ern  media)  do  not  even  constitute  a  chapter.   Myth  and  Hate  sets  out  to  trace  anti-Jewish  myths  in  history,  but  achieves  little  more  than  repetitious  stocktaking.   It  starts  with  the  trial  of  Jesus  and  the  Gospels  -  coinciding  with  the  current  box-office  sensation  The  Pas  sion  of  the  Christ  harking  back  to  the  “Jews  are  Christ  killers”  myth.   Next  the  blood  libel.  A  chapter  deals  with  the  economic  success  of  Jews  and  the  antisemitic  economic  analysis  of  Marx  and  Sombart.  There  is  a  whole  chapter  on  the  Nation  of  Islam  and  their  “contribution”:  the   myth  of  the  Jewish  slaver.   It  is  an  insipid  recital  of  historical  instances,  without  allowing  an  insight  to  the  process  of  currently  occurring  inventions  of  new  antisemitic  myths,   the  revitalisation  of  old  ones  and  the   impact  of  it  all  on  present  day  politi   cal  culture.

"  ASK  THE  AMERICAN   I  insulted  the  South  last  week,  now  it  r  s  New  England's  turn   with  Christian  Brimo   I  got  my  first  bit  of  ""fan  mail""  this  week,  and  I'm  quite  pleased  by  the  intellectual  honesty  of  my  fan  and  fellow  American.  I  will,  of  course,  be  responding  to  some  of  his  questions  in  this  column.  So  ""Chris"",  this  goes  out  to  you,  for  being  the  first  one  with  the  guts  to  call  my  bluff—and  for  teaching  me  the  term  ""Masshole"",  a  great  word  for  the  self-righteous  pricks  who  inhabit  the  great  state  of  Massachusetts.  I  insulted  the  South  last  week.  This  week,  it's  my  fellow-  New  Englanders""  turn.  Q.  'What  were  you  thinkining,  or  more  importantly,  what  were  you  \  on  when  you  wrote  this  crap?  Where  should  I  start?'  A.  By  realising  that  any  letter  you  sent  me  would  just  be  fodder  for  more  mockery?  By  going  back  to  !  Massachusetts,  where  they  take  thing's  more  seriously?  Q.  'First  of  all  I  have  no  idea  xohat  |  you  are  trying  to  convey  in  the  article,  you  appear  to  have  no  viewpoint  whatsoever—are  you  trying  to  be  unbiased  and  informative,  proj  American  or  anti-American.'  A.  At  the  risk  of  sounding  clichéd,  IDm  trying  to  be  unbiased  by  insulting  everybody.  I  know  that's  not  a  snappy  answer,  but  I  want  to  make  this  clear:  I'm  insulting  the  people  who  ask  stupid  questions  founded  on  outdated  cultural  stereotypes,  but  I'm  also  using  that  mockery  to  ""take  the  piss  out  of""  (one  of  the  quaint  Aussie  phrases)  anything  and  anybody  I  feel  like.  If  that  means  embodying  the  worst  stereotypes  of  Americans,  I'll  do  it.  If  that  means  defending  America  from  fellow  elitist  East  Coast  liberal  pricks,  I'll  do  it.  Right  now,  it  means  asking  why  your  brain  can't  comprehend  something  beyond  a  simple  binary  opposition.  Are  you  a  computer?  A  malfunctioning  TI83  Graphing  Calculator?  An  idiot?  Q.  'The  structure  sucks  and  is  not  conducive  to  happy  reading.'  A.  No.  The  structure  used  to  be  ""Question,  Answer"".  Simple.  But  then  you  fucked  it  up  by  including  statements  that  needed  snappy  responses  and  questions  that  could  only  be  answered  with  more  questions.  Thank  you.   Q.  As  this  is  my  first  Tharunka  reading  I  can  only  assume  (hope)  that  this  is  your  first  article  in  the  newspaper  and  pray  that  it  will  be  your  last.'  A.  If  I'd  been  here  last  year,  it  wouldn't  be  ""Ask  the  American"".  It  would  be  ""Ask  the  Jaded  UNSW  student"".  As  for  me,  I  spend  every  day  hoping  nobody  will  fuck  with  another  one  of  my  favourite  songs.  Yet  I'm  sure,  right  now,  George  is  rerecording  Bob  Dylan's  entire  Blood  on  the  Tracks  album,  and  it'll  sell  more  copies  then  the  original  and  be  lapped  up  in  droves  by  clueless  uni  students.  You're  in  the  same  position,  only  you  can  be  sure  Christina  Aguilaria  is  covering  Chuck  Berry's  entire  back  catalogue  in  concert.  'Cause  I  plan  to  be  with  this  paper  a  LONG  times.  There,  I  just  jinxed  myself.  I  hope  you're  happy.  Q.  After  reading  your  article  I  was  ashamed  to  call  myself  American  (andperhaps  even  afellow  Masshole).  lean  only  hope  that  my  fellow  UNSW  students  are  not  naive  enough  to  think  that  every  American  is  as  inarticulate,  illiterate  and  lame  as  you.'  A.  I'm  not  a  ""fellow  Masshole"".  I'm  a  Rocker.  Unless  you  went  to  Simon's  Rock,  you  can  claim  no  kinship  with  me  besides  a  wish  that  the  Red  Sox  hadn't  lost  to  the  Yankees  last  year.  As  for  your  second  comment,  it  proves  you're  actually  an  Australian—'cause  you  just  threw  a  perfect  boomerang.  I'm  sure  my  loyal  readers  can  supply  their  own  ""no,  they're  as  inarticulate,  illiterate  and  lame  as  you""  comments.   Q.  'Please  do  us  all  a  favour  and  if  you  want  to  proceed  with  your  column  please  remove  any  reference  to  being  American  and  please,  please,  please  change  the  name  of  the  column  from  ""Ask  the  American""  to  ""Ask  the  moron"".'  A.  If  you  were  a  true  ""Masshole""  (or  somebody  possessing  any  rudimentary  knowledge  of  world  affairs),  you'd  know  that  one  usually  implies  the  other.  I'd  attempt  to  disabuse  people  of  this  stereotype,  but  you're  my  first  troll  and  I'm  havingfun  feeding  you.  Note  that  most  people  won't  get  this  kind  of  attention  unless  your  rant  is  remarkably  incoherent.  I'm  probably  out  of  space  for  today,  but  I  figure  I  should  answer  the  one  genuine  ""Ask  the  American""  I  got  this  week.  (This  was  asked  in  person,  so  the  asker  got  his  question  in  print  and  a  serious  answer  in  person.  There's  a  lesson  there.)  So,  without  further  ado:  Q.

"  21  Grams   Directed  by  Alejandro  Gonz'alez  In'arritu   Claire  Holden   I  was  never  one  for  the  Benicio  Del  Toro  creature-  that  hideous  Spaniard  who  is  deemed  the  more  primitive  version  of  Brad  Pitt.  However,  with  the  right  role,  which  in  this  case  is  the  role  of  an  obsessed  Christian  (who  is  a  bit  of  a  psycho  really)  he  can  be  incredibly  convincing.  Del  Toro  took  his  place  in  frame  alongside  Sean  Penn  and  Naomi  Watts,  our  very  own  dinkum  Sheila,  and  the  best  film  Hollywood  has  produced  in  a  long  time  took  form.  In  fact,  there  is  a  distinct  non-Hollywood  feel  to  this  piece  of  work,  given  it  seems  to  serve  a  greater  purpose  than  providing  gratuitous  nudity  for  the  lads  (but  there  are  still  enough  booby  moments  to  satisfy  that  demographic),  and  the  cinematography  has  the  critics  and  film  students  raving  alike.  The  theory  is  that  everyone  loses  twenty  one  grams  at  the  time  of  death,  which  raises  the  question  as  to  how  much  our  souls  are  really  worth:  is  that  all  they  weigh?  A  random  turn  of  events  brings  the  lives  of  the  three  main  characters  together,  all  tormented  for  different  (yet  strangely  similar)  reasons,  and  the  viewer  is  encouraged  to  look  into  their  lives  and  ponder  the  greater  meaning.  This  film  draws  upon  its  issues  in  a  way  that  is  quite  similar  to  American  Beauty,  whereby  the  beauty  and  ugliness  of  life  becomes  all  too  apparent  through  the  eyes  of  the  camera  lens.

"  The  Passion  of  the  Christ   Directed  bv  Mel  Gibson   Thom  Mackey  saw  The  Passion  of  the  Christ  at  Greater  Union  Manuka   I  didn't  really  know  what  to  expect  from  this  film.  I  was  half-expecting  blatant  Christian  propaganda,  and  half-expecting  a  shoddily  acted  and  poorly  directed  effort  at  glorifying  Mr.  Of  Nazareth.  I  knew  within  the  first  few  minutes  that  I  had  been  horribly,  horribly  misled  -  The  Passion  is  a  brilliant  film.  Everything  about  it  is  absolutely  top-notch,  with  the  cinematography  and  direction  being  the  best  I've  seen  in  any  film  for  a  long  time.  It's  a  beautiful  movie;  the  costumes  and  sets  are  amazingly  sumptuous  and  detailed,  and  the  actors  really  carry  it  off  -  anyone  would  think  they're  all  two  thousand  years  I  old.  Jesus  was  brilliantly  acted  (does  that  sound  odd  to  anyone  else?),  with  every  ounce  of  his  agony  and  suffering  brought  to  the  fore,  and  his  faith  and  devotion  being  very,  very  powerfully  delivered.  Mel  obviously  took  this  film  very  seriously,  and  the  whole  thing  is  put  across  with  such  power  (and,  well,  Passion)  that  one  of  the  people  next  to  me  was  brought  to  tears  -  and  no,  she  wasn't  Christian.  It's  not  for  the  faint  of  heart  or  weak  of  stomach  -  Mel  didn't  pull  any  punches  when  it  came  to  the  torture  and  suffering  of  JC,  there's  plenty  of  blood  spilled  -  but  it  is  an  extremely  well-made  film,  and  worth  experiencing,  whether  you're  religious  or  not.  In  fact,  if  I  was  into  that  whole  God  thing  then  I  am  sure  I  would  have  felt  extremely  humbled  by  this  film,  so  if  you're  a  religious  kind  of  person  it  would  probably  be  even  more  powerful  for  you.  But  overall,  definitely  one  of  the  best  films  I've  seen  for  a  very  long  time,  even  if  it  is  made  by  a  creationist  homophobe.  *  *  *  *  (5  if  you're  Christian) ",2004-03-07
"  FICTIONAL  JUDAS   I  READ  the  article  by  Stephen  Roth  man  (AJN  10/12)  concerning  the  Lowy-Brogden  controversy.  I  am  appalled  that  a  Jew  in  a  high-profile  position  should  seemingly  accept  the  Christian  theological  narrative   as  historical  fact   In  particular,  he  says  ""Judas  is  the  reviled  Jew  whose  traitorous  disloy   alty  led  to  the  death  of  Jesus”.  Roth   man  should  know  that  there  is  no   corroborating  evidence  to  support  the  Judas  story  and  most  other  parts  of  the  Christian  scriptures.  Even  serious  Christian  scholars  accept   this.   If  Christians  acknowledge  that  their  Bible  is  a  book  of  faith,  not  a  book  of  history,  then  it  ill  behooves  any  Jew  to  accord  it  a  higher  status.

"  Heat  on  US  General  over  Satan  remarks   Lieutenant  General  William  Boykin  of  the  US  Army  is  in  trouble  after  a  report  condemned  him  for  giving  some  23  speeches  since  January  2001  with  a  religious  theme  that  should  have  been  cleared  with   Pentagon  officials.  The  General,  a  high-ranking  intelligence  official  and  evangelical  Christian,  had  been  in  full  uniform  and  spoke  without  disclaimer,  potentially  leading  his  audience  to  think  he  was  acting  in  the  capacity  of  Department  of  Defence  spokesman.  The  problem  is  said  to  be  that  the  content  of  the  speeches  didn't  reflect  formal  US  policy  or  the  opinion  of  the  president.  For  instance,  Boykin  likened  the  war  on  terror  to  a  Christian  crusade  against  Satan,  and  that  America  had  been  the  subject  of  terrorist  attack  because  it  is  a  Christian  nation.  Whilst  a  inspector-general  s  report  recommended  disciplinary  action,  it  is  unclear  how  the  matter  will  be  dealt  with.   Aaron  Rathmell ",2004-08-25

"  Offensive  sign  replaced  by  message  or  love   DENVER  -  The  sign  outside  the  Lovingway  United  Pentecostal  Church  in  Denver,  Colorado,  read:  “Jews  killed  the  Lord  Jesus”.   It  was  a  passage  from  a  letter  writ  ten  by  the  apostle  Paul  1900  years  ago.   Beneath  the  quote  was  the  single  word  “Settled!”  -  a  blunt  statement   reflecting  the  concern  that  Mel  Gib  son’s  film  would  unleash  a  wave  of  antisemitism.   The  sign,  which  appeared  the  day  before  The  Passion  of  the  Christ  opened,  was  a  reference  to  the  cine  matic  depiction  of  the  final  12  hours  of  Jesus’  life.   The  Anti-Defamation  League  asked  Reverend  Maurice  Gordon  to  remove  it;  he  refused,  saying  he  was  merely  quoting  from  the  Bible.   A  protest  rally  organised  by  Col  orado  Jews  and  Christian  activists  drew  200  Jews  and  Christians  in  front  of  Lovingway  Church.   The  following  day,  however,  the  ADL,  Rocky  Mountain  Rabbinical  Council  and  the  American  Jewish  Committee  released  a  statement  say  ing  the  rally  was  not  “in  the  best  inter  ests  of  the  Jewish  community”  because  “the  vast  majority  of  local  Christian  leaders  do  not  blame  Jews  for  Jesus’  death”,  and  a  protest  “could  only  fuel  a  media  circus”.   In  a  statement  condemning  the  sign,  Rev  James  Ryan  of  the  Colorado  Council  of  Churches  said  the  council  “is  disturbed  that  the  Lovingway  United  Pentecostal  Church  has  cho   sen  to  place  a  message  of  judgment  and  division  on  their  outdoor  sign”   “It  is  ironic  that  a  church  named   Lovingway  would  advance  such  an   attitude  of  hurtfulness.   “The  Colorado  Council  of  Churches  wishes  to  make  it  clear  that   this  one  congregation  does  not  speak  for  the  vast  majority  in  the  Christian  community.  We  stand  in  opposition  to  this  sign  and  its  implications.”   “The  charge  of  deicide  against  the  Jewish   people  is  as  wrong  as  saying  all  Germans   were  responsible  for  the  Holocaust""   FRAN  MAIER  Catholic  Archdiocese  of  Denver   Fran  Maier,  interfaith  officer  for  the  Catholic  Archdiocese  of  Denver,  also  took  issue  with  the  sign,  describ  ing  it  as  “very  disturbing”.   “We  are  emphatic  in  our  support  of  the  Jewish  community.  Blaming  the  Jews  for  the  execution  of  Jesus  is  a  blasphemy,  wrong  and  un-Christian.”   Maier,  who  has  seen  The  Passion  twice,  said  only  a  minority  of  Chris  tians  might  react  negatively  towards  Jews  because  of  it.  “A  few  people  will  read  things  into  this  film  or  scripture  that  feed  their  discriminatory  points   Jesus  on  the  cross  in  The  Passion  of  the  Christ.

I’m   confident  this  film  does  not  want  to   assign  collective  blame.”   Cheryl  Morrison,  director  of  Israel  outreach  at  Faith  Bible  Chapel,  could  barely  express  her  outrage.  “No-one  killed  Christ,”  she  said.  “He  died  for  my  sins.  If  you  change  that,  you  change  who  he  is.  Lovingway  is  dis   torting  who  he  is.  I  can’t  believe  any  Christian  would  distort  Jesus’  story.”   Protesters  at  the  rally  denounced  the  sign,  among  them  Bill  McCartney,  former  University  of  Colorado  foot  ball  coach  and  founder  of  the  men’s  Christian  group  Promise  Keepers.   Responding  to  the  protests,  the  church  eventually  changed  the  sign  to  “God  so  loved  the  world  that  he  gave  ...  and  he’s  still  giving”.   And  then  it  changed  it  again  to:  “I  am  deeply  sorry  for  offending  the  Jewish  people,  whom  I  love”.  Signed:   “Brother  Gordon”.   INTERMOUNTAIN  JEWISH  NEWS ",2004-03-12
"  THE  DENVER  DEBATE   THE  public-  and  government-sponsored  celebration  of  Christmas  has  been  a  bone  of  contention  for  many  years  in  the  United  States,  and  the  controversy  has  only  intensified  recently  because  of  the  increasing  activisim  of  conservative  Christians.This  year,  it  was  the  arguably  naive  mayor  of  Denver,  Colorado,  John  Hickenlooper,  who  feitthe  heat  of  Chris  tian  political  lobbying  and  was  forced  to  backtrack  from  his  plan  to  change  the  lighted  sign  atop  the  Denver  Municipal  ity  from  “Meny  Christmas”  to  “Happy  Holidays.”   Denver  also  found  itself  in  ferment  because  of  a  separate  incident  involving  a  proposed  Christian  float  in  the  annual  “Parade  of  lights”.   The  organisers  of  the  Denver  parade  prohibited  the  participation  of  a  float  that  would  play  traditional  Christmas  carols,  thus  inflaming  conservative  Christians  throughout  the  United  States.  Ultimately,  the  carols  were  sung,  in  defi   ance  of  the  ban.   The  Denver  controversy  has  gar  nered  nationwide  media  interest  in  America,  and  other  similar  incidents  are  also  being  reported.The  Chicago  Transit  Authority  was  forced  to  retract  its  deci  sion  to  cancel  its  traditional  'holiday  train”  because  of  budget  constraints,  while  in  Newark  a  goup  calling  itself  “The  Committee  to  Save  Meoy  Christ  mas""  has  called  for  a  boycott  on  the  famous  Mac^s  department  store  on  34th  street,  after  store  management  replaced  ""Meny  Christmas’  with  more  generic  slogans  such  as  ""Happy  Holi  days’  and  ""Season's  Greeting"".   tions,  we  certainly  reciprocate  by  respecting  Christian  traditions.”   Meanwhile,  accusations  are  also  flying  about  retailers  trying  to  save  money  on  decorations  and  using  mul  ticultural  sensitivities  as  a  convenient  excuse.

"  High  school  dalliances  make  a  fine  satire   FILM  REVIEW   SAVED!   Reviewed  by  Don  Perlgut   A  IT’S  a  shame  that  most  adults  will   probably  ignore  the  teen  comedy  Saved!  as  they  will  miss  one  of  the  most  interesting  pieces  of  American  social  satire  this  year.   Whereas  someone  like  Michael  Moore  comments  on  American  polit  ical  life  through  an  in-your-face  Fahrenheit  911,  Saved!  operates  on  a  different  level.   There’s  only  one  snippet  of  George  Bush  in  the  film,  but  there’s  no  doubt  that  it’s  about  the  new  American  Christian  conservatism  of  the  21st  century  promulgated  by  right-wing  Republican  politicians.   Thus  Saved!  is  more  like  Election  and  its  bouncy  cousin  Clueless  than  the  throw-away  American  teen  pics  which  usually  flood  our  shores.   Saved!  takes  place  mostly  in  and  around  Eagle  Christian  High  School,  based  in  an  innocuous  suburban  Maryland.   Our  heroine  is  Mary  (Jena  Mal  one),  a  final-year  student  who  loves  her  boyfriend  so  much  that  she  decides  to  sleep  with  him  in  order  to  r  stop  him  from  becoming  homosexual.   She  does  this  because  Jesus  told  her  to  -  just  as  Jesus  tells  many  char   acters  in  this  satiric  film  what  to  do.   This  one-night  stand  results  in  a  pregnancy,  which  Mary  goes  to  increasingly  difficult  lengths  to  hide  from  her  mother  (a  perfectly-cast  Mary-Louise  Parker)  and  school   friends.   It  also  begins  to  open  her  eyes  to  the  hypocrisy  surrounding  her  life,  especially  Mary’s  ultra-religious  friend  Hilary  Faye  (Mandy  Moore)  who  leads  a  band  of  prayer  group  devotees.   Hilary  manipulates  everyone  within  reach,  including  her  wheel  chair-bound  brother  Roland  (a  very  sultry  Macaulay  Culkin).   But  Mary  begins  to  find  new  meaning  with  a  new  girl  in  school  -  the  seriously  misplaced  Cassandra  (Eva  Amurri)  who  is  Jewish  and  attends  Eagle  Christian  because  every   other  school  threw  her  out.   Mary  also  falls  for  Patrick  (Patrick  Fugit,  so  wonderful  in  Almost  Famous),  the  son  of  Eagle  Christian’s  principal  Pastor  Skip  (Martin  Donovan),  who  in  turn  has  a  serious  flirtation  with  Mar/s  mother.  Meanwhile,  Cassandra  and  Roland  start  to  go  out  together.   As  the  film  proceeds,  Cassandra  becomes  Hilary  Faye’s  chief  protago  nist  (as  well  as  Mary’s  saviour).  The   Eva  Amurri  as  Cassandra,  a  Jewish  student  at  a  Christian  school,  falls  in  love  with  Roland  (Macaulay  Culkin)  in  Saved!.   interesting  implication  (from  these  non-Jewish  film-makers)  is  that  somehow  the  Jew  (who  is  so  very  much  the  outsider  in  this  world)  is  the  most  real,  caring  and  accepting  character  of  all,  despite  her  wayward  and  prickly  appearance.   First-time  director  Brian  Dannelly  has  assembled  a  wonderful  group  of  young  actors,  and  gets  great  perform   ances  from  them.   Aside  from  its  place  as  best  satiric  teen  comedy  of  the  year,  Saved!  will  most  likely  reignite  the  adult  career  of  Culkin  and  propel  the  careers  of  many  of  the  other  cast  members.

"  A  penny  for  your   AVIVA  BARD   DESPITE  the  unfortunate  fact  that  we  need  money  to  promote  acts  of  goodness  and  kindness,  it's  still  a  good  thing  when  it  comes  our   way.   A  Living  in  Harmony  grant  worth  $50,000  was  presented  by  Federal  Minister  for  Education,  Science  and  Training  Dr  Brendan  Nelson  to  North  Shore  Chabad  House  Rabbi  Nochum  Schapiro  for   the  Goodness  and  Kindness  Campaign  which  has  brought  together  leaders  of  the  Jewish,  Christian  and  Muslim  faiths.   An  initiative  of  North  Shore  Chabad  in  co-operation  with  the  Forum  on  Australia  Islamic   Relations  (FAIR),  the  campaign  has  been  introduced  into  schools  to  promote  positive  deeds  and  inter  faith  harmony.   ""The  main  objective  is  for  chil  dren  to  make  the  world  a  better   place  through  specific  acts  of  kind   ness,""  school  campaign  project  director  Rabbi  Zalman  Kastel  said.   ""This  government  support  will  enable  us  to  involve  thousands  more  children  in  kindness  and  har  mony,""  he  added.   The  campaign  competed  against  592  other  applicants  Australia-wide  for  the  grant.   Applauding  Rabbi  Kastel,  Christian  director  Ray  Corbin  and  Muslim  director  Seyfi  Seyit  for  the  ""steps  you  are  taking  in  affirming  core  Australian  values"",  Dr  Nelson  stressed  the  importance  of  educat  ing  youth  in  light  of  the  war  on  ter   ror.   Developed  in  2002,  the  Goodness  and  Kindness  Campaign  has  been  hosted  in  41  schools  and  a  museum  to  date.   ""We  recently  got  our  4000th  commitment  from  a  child  to  make  the  world  a  better  place""  Rabbi   Kastel  said.   Wide  media  coverage  of  the  campaign  has  created  a  momen   turn  for  the  program  in  Jewish,  Muslim  and  Christian  communities  with  stories  appearing  regularly  in  the  North  Shore  Times,  Australian  Jewish  News,  Australia  Fair  and  regional  papers  in  Newcastle  and   the  Central  Coast.   Attesting  to  the  campaign's  pop  ularity,  ABC  TV's  Compass  program  has  produced  an  hour-long  program  dedicated  to  its  success,  to  be  screened  early  this  year,  and  Channel  Ten's  Cheez  TV  has  screened  three  segments  on  the  topic.   ""Based  on  the  expressions  of  interest  we  have  received  from  schools,  we  anticipate  that  by  2004  we-  should  reach  at  least  10,000  students.

"  Fox  News  star  commentator   O’Reilly  riles  American  Jews   STAFF  REPORTER   NEW  YORK  -  The  star  commenta   tor  of  Fox  News,  Bill  O’Reilly,  has  inflamed  American  Jewish  senti  ments  after  telling  an  American  Jewish  radio  listener  who  objected   to  manifestations  of  Christmas  in   the  public  school  system,  “If  you  are  really  offended,  you  gotta  go  to   Israel.”   O’Reilly  -  whose  No  Spin  Zone  is  the  most  popular  show  on  the  Fox  News  Network  -  then  compounded  the  controversy  when  he  reacted  to  a  protest  letter  sent  to  him  by  Abe  Foxman,  the  president  of  the  Anti  Defamation  League  (ADL).  O’Reilly   described  the  ADL  -  one  of  the   most  respected  and  influential  Jew  ish  organisations  in  America  -  as  “an  extremist  group  which  finds  offence  in  pretty  much  everything.”  He  described  Foxman  -  possibly  the  most  prominent  Jew  in  America  today  -  as  “just  a  nut.”   The  storm  broke  in  a  December   3  broadcast  of  O’Reilly’s  weekly   radio  show  called  Radio  Factor.   Responding  to  a  Jewish  listener  who   said  he  was  concerned  about   Christmas  being  used  for  proselytis  ing  in  schools,  O’Reilly  said:  “I  think  you’re  taking  it  too  seriously.  You  have  a  predominantly  Christian  nation.  You  have  a  federal  holiday  based  on  the  philosopher  Jesus.  And  you  don’t  wanna  hear  about  it?   Come  on  [caller],  if  you  are  really  offended,  you  gotta  go  to  Israel   then.  I  mean  because  we  live  in  a   country  founded  on  Judeo  (and  that's  your  guys)  Christian  (that’s  my  guys)  philosophy.  But  over  whelmingly,  America  is  Christian.  And  the  holiday  is  a  federal  holiday  honouring  the  philosopher  Jesus.  So,  you  don’t  wanna  hear  about  it?  Impossible.”   In  response,  ADL  president  Fox  man  wrote  a  letter  to  O’Reilly,  say  ing,  “The  discomfort  with  proselytising,  or  the  intrusion  of  Christian  teachings  in  public  schools,  is  a  very  legitimate  con  cern.”  He  added  that  O’Reilly’s  com  ments  might  “play  into  antisemitic  canards  about  Jews,  that  they  are  not  full  citizens  of  a  country  and  are  not  entitled  to  all  of  the  rights  afforded  to  the  majority”.  Foxman  expressed  hope  that  O’Reilly  would   “be  more  sensitive”.   The  New  York  Daily  News  quoted  Foxman  as  saying  about  O’Reilly’s  attitude:  “How  simplistic.  How  gross.  What  a  no  spin  zone!  It  cross   es  the  line  into  antisemitism.”   O’Reilly  was  recently  involved  in  a  different  kind  of  scandal,  involv  ing  charges  of  sexual  harassment  levelled  by  former  assistant  Andrea  Mackris,  but  the  case  was  settled  out  of  court  after  a  reported  hefty  pay  out  to  Mackris  by  Fox.

"  The  dangerous  impact  of  l  he  Passion   A  QUESTION  posed  by  a  Year  10  student  during  a  school  tour  of  the  Jewish  Museum  of  Australia  shows  how  dangerous  the  impact  of  Mel  Gibson’s  movie,  The  Passion  of  the  Christ,  can  be,  B’nai  B’rith  Anti  Defamation  Commission  chairman  Dr  Paul  Gardner  told  a  Christian  forum  on  the  film  in  Melbourne  last  week.   In  an  address  to  the  forum,   organised  by  the  Catholic  Adult  Education  and  the  Ecumenical  and   Interfaith  Commission,  Dr  Gardner  said  a  student  from  a  visiting  Chris  tian  college  asked  a  guide:  “Why  did  you  Jews  kill  Jesus  Christ?”   Told  that  not  everything  in  the  film  was  true,  the  student  argued  that  it  was  spoken  in  Latin  and  Aramaic,  which   meant  it  had  to  be  authentic.   Dr  Gardner  said:  “Even  if  I  agree  that  Mel  Gibson  did  not  set  out  to   promote  contempt  ...  I  am  dis  turbed  by  the  potential  of  the  film  to  provoke  bigotry.” ",2004-04-09
"  FROM  1HE  EDITOR   valhadefl^ewlshne^Rgtau   IT  was  one  of  the  most  moving  moments  of  CNN’s  coverage  of  the  D-Day  anniversary.   The  cameras  cut  away  from  the  ceremonies  in  Normany  to  accommo  date  footage  of  the  1944  Warsaw  uprising  (as  opposed  to  the  1943  Warsaw  Ghetto  uprising).   Waclaw  Micuta,  a  member  of  the  Polish  Underground,  related  how  his  fighters  captured  two  German  tanks,  and  he  suggested  using  them  to  smash  one  of  the  walls  enclosing  the  Warsaw   Ghetto  to  liberate  the  thousands  of  Jews  trapped  within.   His  commander  allowed  him  to  use  one  of  the  tanks,  and  he  and  his  men  did  precisely  that  -  crushing  a  section   of  the  wall  and  freeing  a  few  hundred  Jews  from  certain  death.   “I  didn’t  see  them  as  Jews,  just  as  people  who  needed  help,”  the  now  elderly  Micuta  recalled  in  his  broken  English.  “They  hugged  us.  It  was  a  very  emotional  experience  for  all  of  us.”   WE  salute  the  heroes  of  June  6,1944  -  the  150,000  Allied  soldiers  who  landed  in  France  to  begin  the  recapture  of  Europe  from  the  Nazi  jackboot.   But  did  anyone  find  a  jarring  note  in  the  ceremony?  The  singing  of  Onward  Christian  Soldiers,  for  exam  ple.  The  repeated  reference  to  Jesus.  The  fact  that  the  main  ceremony  -  fea  turing  US  President  George  Bush  and   French  President  Jacques  Chirac  -  took  place  beneath  a  giant  cross.   Some  of  those  courageous  D-Day  soldiers  were  Jewish,  Sikh,  Muslim,  atheist  or  of  no  persuasion  at  all.  Certainly,  they  were  not  all  Christian.   If  the  Christian  elements  were   deemed  worthy  of  inclusion  in  the  program,  no  problem  there  -  as  long  as  there  was  some  attempt  at  ecumeni  cal  balance  which  would  have  made   the  ceremony  inclusive  of  all  who  risked  their  lives  on  that  historic  day.   Such  a  consideration  is  essential  at   any  time;  how  much  more  so  in  these  times  of  divisiveness  and  suspicion.   VICALHADEFF ",2004-06-11
"  LET’S  AVOID  ANOTHER  PR  DISASTER  -  WARNING   B'NAI  B'rith’s  Anti-Defamation  Commis  sion  (ADC)  has  warned  the  Jewish  com  munity  to  react  responsibly  to  the  controversial  Hollywood  film  about  the  crucifixion  of  Jesus,  or  risk  a  public  relations  disaster  as  damaging  as  last  year's  Hanan  Ashrawi  affair.

"  ANTISEMITIC  DOCUMENT   FEYGI  Zylberman  (AJN  19/3/04)  states  that  the  association  of  The  Pas  sion  with  the  Holocaust  is  an  insult  to  our  six  million.   Nothing  could  be  further  from  the  truth.  All  Nazi  parties  of  Eastern  Europe  (Romania,  Hungary,  Croatia,  Slovakia)  used  the  Christian  religion  and  in  particular  the  Passion  story  as  arguments  in  their  ideology.   For  example,  the  full  name  of  Romania’s  Nazi  organisation,  The  Iron  Guard,  was  The  Legion  of  Archangel  Michael  and  it  numbered  countless  Christian  clerics  among  its  leaders.   Its  newspaper,  Poruca  Vremii,  used   motifs  from  the  Passion  in  its  anti  Jewish  instigations.   The  Gospels,  therefore,  had  a  lot  to   do  with  the  Shoah.   While  Gibsons  movie  is  anything  but  a  work  of  art,  every  frame,  facial  expression,  word  and  gesture  has  the  intent  of  portraying  the  Jews  who  did  not  follow  Jesus  as  a  despicable,  mean,  sanguine,  murderous,  Satanic  mob.   The  film  is  the  strongest  antisemit  ic  document,  being  witnessed  by  mil   lions  and  that  is  all  that  matters.   Om)  WALD  MANN  Bellevue  Hill,  NSW ",2004-04-02
"  JEWISH  VIEWS   STEPHEN  Rothman  apparently  is  now  in  the  business  of  trademarking  the  word  “Jewish”.   He  contends  (AJN  18/6/04)  that  the  Australian  Jewish  Democratic  Society  has  no  right  to  present  itself  as  a  “Jewish”  organisation  or  as  having  a  “Jewish  viewpoint”.   He  offers  two  reasons:  the  AJDS  is  only  a  small  minority  group  within  the  Australian  Jewish  community,  and  its  views  diverge  from  the  latter’s   “overwhelming  view”   Whether  taken  separately  or  together,  these  reasons  constitute  a  bad,  even  dangerous,  argument.   If  minority  membership  is  defin  itive,  most  Jewish  organisations  will  need  to  scrub  “Jewish”  from  their  letterheads.   If  divergence  from  the  main  stream  view  is  what  denies  entitle  ment  to  self-identification,  then  heaven  help  minority  groups  like  Australian  Jews,  who  wish  to  be  considered  Australian  just  like  the  overwhelmingly  Christian  majority.   Was  it  not  One  Nation  that   insisted  that  Australian  meant  being   Christian?   We  have  a  way  of  accommodat  ing  Rothman  s  concern  that  works  perfectly  fine:  we  distinguish  between  “representative/unrepre   sentative”  or  “official/unofficial”   views.

"  A  motif  from  the  Journey  of  Promise  program.   Participants  Ezra  Sarajinsky  and  Bronwyn  Lee.   Journey  of  promise,   10  Christians,  10  Jews  and  a  varying  number  of  Muslims,  all  aged  between  18  and  25,  spent  six  days  together  in  intense  discussion  on  their  differences  -  and  commonalities.  This  report  by  AVIVA  BARD.   IT’S  a  glimmer  of  hope  in  a  world   infected  with  fundamentalism.   With  a  globe  in  the  grip  of  Islamist  terrorism  and  swept  up  by  Mel  Gibson’s  reactionary  interpreta  tion  of  the  crucifixion  of  Jesus,  the  world  seems  littered  with  fundamen  talist  doctrine.   Yet  there  are  some  who  are   resolutely  engaging  in  interfaith  dialogue,  and  for  their  efforts  they  have  received  a  $50,000  “Living  in  Harmony”  grant  from  the  Federal   Government.   Called  the  Journey  of  Promise  and  organised  by  the  National  Council  of  Churches  in  conjunction  with  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  and  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry,  10  Muslims,  10  Jews  and  10  Christians  aged  between  18  and  25  were  meant  to  spend  six  days  together  in  interfaith  discussion.   Except  that  —  to  the  disappoint  ment  of  other  participants  —  there  were  never  10  Muslims  involved,  the  number  fluctuating  between  one  and  13  at  any  given  time.   Gathering  at  a  campsite  outside  Sydney,  icebreakers  were  held  before  serious  discussion  began.   Significantly,  and  as  an  initial   ground-rule,  politics  was  left  off  the  agenda.  But,  judging  by  the  reactions  of  participants,  its  absence  proved  not  to  be  the  most  burning  issue.   “I  don’t  think  the  point  was  to  deal  with  every  single  issue,”  said  law  student  Ezra  Sarajinsky,  25,  a  Jewish  participant.   “Part  of  it  is  establishing  a  rela  tionship  so  that  when  you  do  have  arguments,  you’re  aware  of  com  monalities  so  that  an  argument  does  n’t  mean  the  end  of  your  dialogue.   “Religion’s  higher  than  politics.   It’s  the  most  emotional  and  real  side  to  a  person,  but  if  you  can  show  that  the  religions  don’t  have  to  conflict  on  certain  issues,  it  doesn’t  have  to  be  the  biggest  civilisation  clash.   “I  don’t  feel  I  really  had  a  chance  to  talk  about  it  that  well.  There   wasn’t  a  solid  group  of  Muslims  there  the  whole  time  to  break  the  ice  with,”  he  added.   “I  didn’t  want  a  six-hour  conversation  about  it  without  having  established  a  relationship.  That  hap  pened  with  the  Christian  contingent,   not  with  the  Muslims.”   Describing  herself  as  a  religiously  observant  Anglican,  Arts  student  Bronwyn  Lee,  20,  said  the  three  faiths   had  a  great  deal  to  learn  from  each  other  because  of  their  different,  yet  similar,  experiences  of  God.   “Hearing  about  other  people’s  experiences  with  prejudice  and  meet  ing  them  makes  you  more  aware.  You’re  a  lot  more  sensitive,”  she  said.   “Real  dialogue  and  understanding  between  people  of  different  religions  is  the  way  to  avoid  that  conflict.  Just  interacting  and  being  friends  with  a  group  of  people  from  another  religion  helps  you  be  less  paranoid   and  more  normal.   “It’s  also  important  to  do  things  on  a  less  organised  level  with   friends.”   Activities  during  the  program  were  many  and  varied,  including  visiting  synagogues,  mosques,  churches,  war  memorials,  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  and  the  Wayside  Chapel  -  and  discussing  theological  and  metaphysical  issues  until  5am  on  some  days.   It  was  after  a  religious  epiphany  at  the  age  of  20  that  Sarajinsky  became  more  observant  and  joined  the  pro  gram  out  of  a  desire  “to  know  main  stream  Australia  on  a  spiritual  level”.   “I  wanted  to  interact  with  Australians  as  religious  people,  as   Journey  of  Promise  participants  break  bread.

And  I  wanted  to  teach  people  about  Judaism.   “In  regard  to  the  Christian  community,  we’ve  overcome  the  life  or-death  issue  that  had  been  evident  up  to  50  years  ago.  Now  what’s  important  is  the  way  these  two  communities  operate  through  religious  dialogue.”   “I  saw  Australians  as  secular  or  post-Christian;  now  I  realise  this  whole  culture  is  infused  with   Christianity.  I  now  feel  I’m  living  in  a  Christian  society.”   Sunni  Muslim  participant  Lutfi  Hady,  22,  son  of  Zetland  Mosque  Imam  Amin  Hady,  concurred.   “When  it  came  to  getting  to  know  the  Christians,  I  didn’t  feel  like  we  had  too  much  ground  to  cover.   “Growing  up  in  the  Australian  culture,  you  have  more  contact  with  Christians;  there  was  less  catching  up  to  do.  I  learnt  a  lot,  but  I  didn’t  feel  I  had  stereotypes  to  break  down.”   Studying  design  science  at  the  University  of  Technology,  Sydney,  and  working  as  a  technical  director  for  Sky  News,  Hady  said  the  best  aspect  of  the  Journey  of  Promise  was   the  “direct  person-to-person  contact  with  Jews,  Muslims  and  Christians  to  break  down  the  barriers  and  stigmas  we  might  have  had  about  each  other’s  religions”.   “It’s  humanised  and  put  a  face  to  people  of  other  religions.  On  a  day  to-day  basis,  it’s  opened  me  up  and  made  me  more  likely  to  make  friends  with  Jewish  and  Christian  people   because  we  have  so  much  in   common.   “It  becomes  human  nature  to   stereotype  and  generalise  because   that  saves  us  time  in  the  end.  To   counteract  that,  you  need  to  be  more  patient  and  spend  as  much  time  with  people  as  you  can  to  get  to  know   them.”   Describing  it  as  “discouraging”   that  more  Muslims  did  not   participate  in  the  program,  Hady  plans  to  work  with  his  community  to  ensure  a  greater  Muslim  presence  at   future  such  events.   “The  Journey  of  Promise  was  to  get  us  back  to  the  roots  of  who  we  are  and  our  religion.  Sure,  politics  has  an  important  effect  on  us,  but  you  need  to  be  able  to  let  go  of  a  lot  of  things  to   break  down  barriers.   “It  might  have  been  disingenuous  [to  avoid  politics],  but  it  was  probably  the  best  idea  to  keep  things  on  more  of  a  personal  level.   “The  direct  effect  that  the  Journey  of  Promise  has  is  more  important  for  our  communities.  We’re  hoping  to  create  a  small  ripple  which  will  even  tually  spread  out  from  where  we  are  and  one  day  affect  those  abroad  and   show  what  can  be  done.”   Also  emerging  from  the  program  was  an  unexpected  manifestation  -  “there  was  more  arguing  within  each  group  than  between  the  groups”,  Sarajinsky  revealed.   “You’ve  got  to  sort  out  things  in  your  own  family  first.”   Agreeing  with  this  observation,  Lee  said  she  was  “surprised  at  the  fact  that  she  was  surprised”  that  Catholics  had  participated.   “There  was  division  there  that  I  wasn’t  even  aware  of.  I  was  talking  about  my  own  viewpoint,  and  people  were  asking  what  the  actual  Christian   belief  was.  I  said  I  didn’t  know.   “We  don’t  have  an  actual  Christ  ian  line  about  it.   “It’s  important  within  my  own  religion  that  we  don’t  have  to  come  to   a  united  decision  on  the  answers.”   Agreeing  that  the  program  should   become  an  annual  event  with   different  participants  each  year,  Sara  jinsky  and  Lee  noted  that  “a  Journey  of  Promise  is  stronger  than  Mel   Gibson”.

"  From  terrorist  to  Zionist   MICHAEL  FREUND   JERUSALEM  -  A  former  Palestinian  terrorist  who  took  part  in  attacks  against  Israelis  in  the  mid-1970s  has  now  become  a  vocal  pro-Israel  Christ  ian  activist  in  the  United  States  as  part  of  his  “repentance”  for  his  past  actions.   “My  first  goal  is  to  give  strength  to  the  Jewish  people,  to  give  encourage  ment,  to  get  rid  of  this  stupid  idea  of  establishing  a  Palestinian  state,”  Walid  Shoebat  told  the  Jerusalem  Post  in  a  telephone  interview  from  his  West  Coast  home.  “I  had  a  change  of  heart,  and  I  am  now  very  Zionist  I  tie  myself  to  the  God  of  Israel,”  he  said.   Shoebat  who  was  bom  in  1960  to  a  Palestinian  Muslim  father  and  an  American  Christian  mother,  was  raised  as  a  Muslim  and  spent  much  of  his  youth  in  the  village  of  Beit  Sahur,  outside  of  Bethlehem,  and  later  in  Jericho.  As  a  child  in  school,  he  says,  he  was  indoctrinated  to  hate  Jews.   “I  remember  singing  in  school:  ‘Arabs  are  beloved,  Jews  are  dogs’  We  were  taught  that  Jews  are  descendants  of  monkeys  and  pigs,”  he  recalls.   As  a  result  of  his  education,  Shoe  bat  also  refused  to  believe  that  the  Holocaust  had  occurred.   “I  used  to  watch  the  Holocaust  shows  on  Israeli  television  on  Yom  Hashoah  with  popcorn  and  laughter,   because  I  did  not  believe  it  was  true.  I   thought  it  was  a  fabrication.  I  won  dered  where  they  found  these  skinny  actors  to  portray  the  victims,”  he  now  says  with  regret   Shortly  thereafter,  Shoebat  began  to  take  part  in  anti-Israel  activities,  proving  adept  at  riling  up  crowds  of   demonstrators.   “As  a  teenager,  I  was  involved  in  a  lot  of  rioting  and  demonstrating,  par  ticularly  between  the  ages  of  14  and  18.  I  threw  stones  at  rabbis  at  the  Western  Wall  and  protested  on  the  Temple  Mount”   After  being  inducted  into  a  Pales  tinian  terrorist  group,  Shoebat  agreed  to  take  part  in  his  first  attack.  “I  car  ried  a  loaf  of  bread  with  explosives  in  it  and  my  mission  was  to  destroy  the  Bank  Leumi  branch  in  Bethlehem,”  he  says.   But  when  he  arrived  at  the  site  of  his  intended  target  he  saw  a  group  of   children  playing  outside  and  had  second  thoughts,  “so  I  threw  it  on  the  roof  of  the  bank  I  walked  away  and  a  few  minutes  later  heard  an  explosion.  It  shook  me  up  greatly”   His  other  brush  with  terrorism  occurred  in  the  mid-1970s,  when  Shoebat  and  a  group  of  friends  near  ly  beat  an  Israeli  soldier  to  death  in   Bethlehem.   Shoebat  was  later  arrested  on  other  charges  and  served  a  few  months  in  an  Israeli  prison.  At  the  age  of  18,  he  moved  to  the  United  States,  where  he  became  a  pro-Palestinian  activist  in  Chicago  and  raised  funds   for  the  PLO.   I  “My  whole  dream  was   to  destroy  Jews  and  to   destroy  the  State  of   Israel.  Now  I  want  to   fight  for  Israel  from  both  theological  and  political   I  perspectives”   WAUD  SHOEBAT  Terrorist  turned  Christian  activist   But  in  1993,  after  marrying  a  Catholic  woman  whom  he  had  tried  to  persuade  to  convert  to  Islam,  Shoe  bat’s  life  took  a  sudden  and  highly  unexpected  turn.   When  his  wife  insisted  he  prove  his  assertion  that  the  Jews  had  distort  ed  the  words  of  the  prophets,  Shoebat  purchased  a  Bible  and  sat  down  to  read  it  The  experience,  he  says,  lead  him  to  abandon  Islam  and  adopt  evangelical  Christianity.   When  his  family  learned  of  his  con  version,  he  was  disowned  and  received  death  threats,  and  Shoebat  is  certain  the  PLO  is  planning  his  demise.   Nevertheless,  he  is  determined  to  make  amends  for  his  past  actions.  “I  seek  forgiveness.  My  whole  dream  was  to  destroy  Jews  and  to  destroy  the  State  of  Israel.”  Now,  he  says,  “I  want  to  fight  for  Israel  from  both  theologi  cal  and  political  perspectives.  Israel  must  never  be  divided,”  he  insists,  adding  that,  “I  believe  that  Zionism  is  the  process  of  Jews  making  aliyah  and  going  back  to  their  land.  I  call  myself   a  Christian  Zionist”   JERUSALEM  POST ",2004-02-20

Academy  BJE  principal  Lily  Maltz  said  the  organisation  was  ""very  pleased  to  receive  the  grant  because  interfaith  harmo  ny  is  always  a  priority  for  the  Jewish  com  munity"".   The  money  will  be  used  for  an  interfaith  program  with  Christian  students  to  edu  cate  them  about  Judaism.  Students  from  the  Seventh  Day  Adventist  and  Anglican  churches  will  be  involved  in  the  program,  to  be  launched  in  January  2005.   The  project  will  consist  of  two  visits  per'  !  month  for  10  months,  where  approximate   ly  100  students  will  interact  with  the  local  Jewish  community  and  learn  about  Jewish  history,  traditions  and  rituals.  Interfaith  vis  its  between  Christian  and  Jewish  schools  will  also  form  part  of  the  program.  Harmony  Day  events  are  also  being  planned  for  next  March.   Maltz  hopes  the  project  will  give  non  Jewish  students  an  ""authentic  view  of  our  community"".   ""Outreach  is  part  and  parcel  of  what  we  i  do  because  we  are  in  working  in  the  wider   [  community.

"  The  highs  and  lows  of  Jewish  life  in  Spain   SICHAT  YOSEF   YOSSI  ARON   Though  communities  of  crypto-Jews   continued  to  exist  in  Spain  (and  its   overseas  territories)  throughout  the   centuries,  that  edict  of  expulsion  was  not  formally  rescinded  until  1968.   AST  week’s  horrific  bombings  in   Madrid  directed  world  atten   tion  towards  Spain.  Whatever  the  purported  reason  for  the   bombings,  which  if  not  related  to  internal  Spanish  affairs  may  involve  radical  Islamist  reaction  to  Spain’s  involvement  in  Iraq  or  a  general  antipathy  among  Islamic  terrorists  to  the  West,  Spain  has  long  been  a  cross  roads  between  Islam  and  Christianity.   The  nature  of  their  relationship   has  varied  from  one  of  coexistence  to   one  of  outright  hatred  -  with  intoler  ance  at  different  times  characterising   both  sides  of  the  conflict.  And  as  is   the  way  of  many  cultural  conflicts,  Jews  have  always  found  themselves  falling  somewhere  in  between  the  sparring  powers.   Ask  any  Jew  about  Spain  and  the  first  things  that  will  come  to  mind  will  be  the  Spanish  Inquisition  and  subsequent  expulsion.  But  while  Jew   ish  involvement  there  has  been  mini   mal  since  1492  -  only  really  developing  again  in  the  20th  century  -  there  is  much  more  to  the  Jews’  relationship  with  Spain.   Its  significance  is  emphasised  by  the  fact  that  the  most  common  ways  of  defining  Jews  into  different  group  ings  based  on  custom  and  heritage  is  Ashkenazi  and  Sephardi.  These  terms  originally  referred  to  the  two  differ   ent  communities  on  either  side  of  the   Pyrenees.  Ashkenazim  -  now  the  term  commonly  used  for  those  of  European  origin  -  referred  to  those  in  the  Crusader  lands  of  the  Rhine   Valley.  Sephardim  mean  those  of  the  Iberian  Peninsula  (Sepharad  is  Hebrew  for  Spain).   That  the  term  Sephardim  was  then  popularly  used  for  all  those  Jews  across  North  Africa  and  beyond   The  Interior  of  the  Toledo  synagogue  founded  In  1203...  now  a  church  known  as   Santa  Maria  la  Blanca.  Photo:  Isranet   (including  Egypt,  the  Levant  and  Mesopotamia),  reflected  the  connec  tion  between  those  Jews  of  Spain  and  those  of  Africa  and  the  Levant.  This   connection  was  facilitated  by  the  fact  that  those  lands  were  part  of  the   Islamic  world  -  which  for  centuries   was  less  negative  to  Jewish  life  than  countries  ruled  by  Christianity,  espe  cially  those  under  Catholic  control.   The  first  Jews  settled  in  Spain  dur  ing  the  heyday  of  the  Roman  Empire.  However  the  weakening  of  the  empire  and  the  subsequent  sixth-century  conversion  to  Christianity  of  Spain’s  rulers  sparked  an  era  of  persecution.  As  early  as  613  CE  (over  800  years  prior  to  the  expulsion)  Jews  were  ordered  to  convert  or  leave  Spain.  Many  adopted  the  position  better   known  from  the  time  of  the  Marra   nos  -  public  conversion  while  private  ly  maintaining  the  Jewish  faith.  And  it  was  such  conversos  who  welcomed  the  Muslims  on  their  arrival  across  the  Straits  of  Gibraltar  in  711.   Under  the  Umayyad  rule,  which  commenced  in  755,  Jewish  culture  flourished  alongside  their  Arab  coun  terparts.  In  the  10  th  century  Cordoba   became  the  centre  of  both  Arab  and  Jewish  culture.  This  was  the  time  of  the  rise  to  prominence  of  court  physician  and  diplomat  Hasdai  ibn  Shaprut   However  in  the  12th  century  the  position  of  the  Jews  worsened  under   the  fanatical  Almohades  who  invad  ed  from  Morocco  -  and  there  was   even  a  preference  among  Jews  for  survival  in  the  Christian  portion  of  the  peninsula.   Nevertheless  by  the  13th  century  legislation  defined  the  position  of  the  Jews.  Given  certain  legal  rights  and  protection,  they  were  also  subject  to  controls  over  their  interrelationship   with  the  Christian  citizens.  Such  con  trols  aside,  Jewish  courtiers  rose  to  the  highest  positions,  maintaining  a  continuity  which  had  its  origin  in  the  position  of  Jews  under  Muslim  rulers  both  in  Spain  and  elsewhere.   The  friction  between  Jews  and  Christians  in  Spain  in  the  13th  century  is  exemplified  by  the  public  debate  on  religious  philosophy  which  led  Nach  manides  —  the  Ramban  —  to  flee  to  the  Holy  Land.  Nevertheless  the  same  era  saw  the  flowering  of  kabbalistic  literature  in  Spain  followed  in  about  1340  by  the  publication  in  Castile  of   the  Arba  Turim  -  the  basis  of  the  Shulchan  Aruch  as  we  know  it  today.   However  by  the  end  of  the  14th  century  Christian  fanaticism  had  reasserted  itself  to  such  a  degree  that  many  were  forced  to  flee  or  convert.   It  was  such  conversos  who  set  the  scene  for  the  expulsion  less  than  a  century  later.  The  church  feared  that  the  existence  of  openly  proud  Jews  meant  that  the  conversos  would  never  truly  reconcile  themselves  to   their  Christian  status.   Though  communities  of  crypto  Jews  continued  to  exist  in  Spain  (and  its  overseas  territories)  throughout  the  centuries,  that  edict  of  expulsion  was  not  formally  rescinded  until  1968.

"  PETER  KOHN  AND  MICHAEL  CAVANAGH   THE  Jewish  community  has  nothing  to  fear  from  Family  First,  the  new  political  party  that  could  hold  the  bal  ance  of  power  in  the  Senate,  say  com  munity  leaders  quizzed  by  the  AJN.   But  senior  ALP  figures,  concerned  that  Family  First  could  give  the   Federal  Government  control  of  the   Senate,  are  adopting  a  wait-and-see   attitude  on  its  links  to  the  Assemblies  of  God  (AOG)  churches.   The  fledgling  party  may  gain  Sen  ate  representation  after  leading  Victo  rian  rookie  candidate  Steve  Fielding  received  1.9  per  cent  of  the  Victorian  vote  under  the  Senate’s  proportional  representation  system.   A  strengthened  Liberal  Senate,  with  the  party  gaining  two  or  possibly  three  extra  Senators,  means  the  Liberals  might  be  in  a  position  to  control  the  Senate  with  the  support  of  Fielding.   Family  First’s  policies  include  the  signing  only  of  treaties  that  comply  with  “the  preservation  of  our  Judeo  Christian  foundations”,  support  for  mandatory  detention  of  asylum-seek  ers  and  mandatory  internet  filtering  to  remove  access  to  pornography.   Federal  member  for  Melbourne   Ports  Michael  Danby  described  Family  First  as  “a  very  conservative  group  modelled  on  similar  groups  in  the  United  States”  that  would  help  the  government  “push  through  its  hard  line  agenda”  in  the  Senate.   He  said  the  party’s  extremely  brief  exposure  in  the  media  gained  it  a  lot  of  votes  without  having  to  explain  its  principles  in  much  detail.  “People  didn’t  know  who  they  were.  Had  you  heard  about  them  10  weeks  ago?”   But  Jewish  Community  Council  of  South  Australia  president  Norman  Schueler,  in  whose  state  Family  First  was  founded,  said  the  Jewish  commu  nity  has  no  need  to  be  concerned.   He  believed  its  policy  on  asylum   seekers  is  “a  tad  softer  than  that  of  the   government”,  while  its  opposition  to  same-sex  marriages  “does  not  vary  from  the  views  of  most  in  the  Jewish  community”.   He  told  the  AJN  this  week  that  his  council  “welcomes  the  fact  that  they  [Family  First]  are  likely  to  be  part  of  the  governing  fabric  of  Australia.  We  have  had  good  dialogue  with  them  and  that’s  likely  to  continue.”   The  Union  for  Progressive  Judaism’s  regional  director,  Rabbi  John   Rabbi  John  Levi...   describes  the  Assemblies  of   God  movement  as  “supportive  of  Israel  [and]  certainly  not  hardline  [on  social   issues]”.   Levi,  whose  inter-faith  initiatives  have  brought  him  in  close  contact  with  many  church  groups,  described  the  Assemblies  of  God  movement  as  “sup  portive  of  Israel  [and]  certainly  not  hardline  [on  social  issues]”.   “The  Jewish  community   needs  to  treat  them  the  way  we  would   expect  anyone  to  treat  us  and  that  is  give  them  a  fair  go.”   JEREMY  JONES  President,  Executive  Council   of  Australian  Jewry   Rabbi  Levi  understands  fears  in  the   Jewish  community  about  religion  based  parties  but  said:  “Jews  often  don’t  understand  the  impact  of  other  religions  on  politics  because  often  the/re  not  involved  with  them.”   Executive  Council  of  Australian   Jewry  (ECAJ)  president  Jeremy  Jones   compared  the  party  to  the  Christian  Democratic  Party  run  by  Reverend   Fred  Nile.   Asked  whether  the  experiences  of  some  Jewish  Holocaust  survivors  with  Christian  political  parties  in  prewar  Europe  might  cause  consternation  with  Family  First,  Jones  said:  “Were  living  in  Australia  in  2004...  the  Jewish  community  needs  to  treat  them  the  way  we  would  expect  anyone  to  treat  us  and  that  is  give  them  a  fair  go.”   Jones  said  the  ECAJ  or  die  state  community  roof  bodies  would  set  up  a  dialogue  with  any  members  of  Family  First  who  got  into  parliament,  as  it  has  done  over  the  years  with  all  parties  except  One  Nation.   Jones  added  the  swing  against  the  ALP  has  thrown  in  doubt  the  parlia  mentary  careers  of  a  number  of  friends  of  the  Jewish  community,  including  Labor  MPs  Martyn  Evans  in  South  Australia,  Con  Sciacca  in  Queensland  and  Jann  McFarlane  in  Western  Australia.

"  Holocaust  study  highlights   Australian  indifference   BOOK  REVIEW   SOL  ENCEL   JOURNEY  INTO  DARKNESS   Winton  Higgins   Brandi  and  bcmesinger,  b^y.yo   JOURNEY  Into  Darkness  is  a  pro  foundly  interesting  yet  disturbing  book  which  compares  favourably  with  Inga  Clendinnen’s  Reading  the  Holo   caust.   The  two  books  are  comparable  in  terms  of  depth  and  substance,  although  the  authors  —  both  non  Jewish  —  approach  their  subject  in  very  different  ways  and  with  rather  dif  ferent  objectives.   Clendinnen  endeavoured  to  under  stand  how  the  Holocaust  could  have   happened  by  mastering  the  vast  litera  ture  on  the  subject  Dr  Higgins  has  also  read  widely,  but  takes  a  more  per  sonal  approach.   Most  of  the  book  is  taken  up  with  a  day-to-day  account  of  his  participa  tion  in  a  four-week  course  at  Yad  Vashem.  To  this  he  adds  a  section  describing  his  subsequent  visit  to  Poland  and  several  of  the  death  camps,  including  Auschwitz,  Majdanek,   Belzec  and  Sobibor.   Dr  Higgins  teaches  political  science  at  Macquarie  University  and  his  account  of  his  experiences  is  inter   spersed  with  scholarly  reflections  on  German  history,  Christian  Judeopho  bia  and  Australian  immigration  policy.   He  is  a  Buddhist,  which  makes  his  account  of  Christian  persecution  of  the  Jews  particularly  interesting.  One  would  have  liked  to  know  more  about  his  reasons  for  moving  away  from  his  Christian  upbringing  into  the  Bud   dhist  fold.   He  does  not  mince  his  words  in   describing  the  depredations  of  the  Crusaders,  or  the  behaviour  of  Pope  Pius  XI1  during  the  Holocaust.   He  endorses  the  views  of  John  Cornwell,  author  of  Hitler’s  Pope  that  Pius’s  actions  were  not  merely  those  of  a  flawed  individual,  but  the  moral  fail  ure  of  a  Vatican.   Throughout  the  19th  and  20th  cen  turies,  Dr  Higgins  notes,  “the  Vatican  set  its  face  against  the  entire  agenda  of  social  and  political  modernisation  as  a  threat  to  its  power”,  and  its  more  recent  behaviour  should  be  seen  against  this  background.   The  Vatican  did  not  even  recognise  the  Italian  state  until  the  Lateran   Treaty  of  1929,  negotiated  by  the  future  Pius  XI1,  Cardinal  Pacelli,  with  the  Fascist  regime  of  Mussolini.  Pacelli  also  negotiated  a  similar  treaty  with  Nazi  Germany  in  1933.   A  major  influence  on  Dr  Higgins’  thinking  is  the  sociologist  Zygmunt   Bauman,  whose  book  The  Holocaust  and  Modernity  has  had  a  major  impact   on  Holocaust  studies.   As  Higgins  writes,  his  “journey  into  darkness”  was  partly  undertaken  to  pursue  Baumans  argument  that  the  Holocaust  is  a  defining  moment  in  modem  Western  civilisation,  pointing  to  a  destructive  potential  that  exists  in  every  Western  community.   Every  Western  nation  must  culti  vate  a  Holocaust  awareness  that  high  lights  its  moral  risks  and  provides  early  warning.   Higgins  agrees  with  most  of  Bau  man’s  thesis,  but  maintains  that  the  Holocaust  was  not  a  “mainstream”  development.  On  the  contrary,  he   argues,  “it  constitutes  a  stark  warning  about  what  can  happen  to  a  Western  society  that  strays  from  mainstream  Western  moral  development”.   The  central  moral  values  of  West  ern  society  —  equal  and  inclusive  citi  zenship,  pluralism,  democracy,  universal  human  rights,  respect  for  life  and  sensitivity  to  the  suffering  of  oth  ers-do  not  provide  a  basis  for  geno   cide.   Dr  Higgins  is  concerned  that  his  own  country,  Australia,  may  be  stray  ing  from  these  values  and  drifting  into  a  xenophobic  nationalism  which  underlies  the  actions  of  the  present  Federal  government,  such  as  its  shameful  treatment  of  asylum  seekers.   He  is  appalled  by  the  kind  of  moral  indifference  which  sustains  such  actions  and  compares  it  to  the  moral  indifference  which  made  the  Holo  caust  possible.   Unfortunately  the  production  stan  dards  of  the  book  do  not  match  the  quality  of  its  content  There  are  far  too  many  trivial  errors.  Brandi  and  Schlesinger  are  to  be  congratulated  on  bringing  out  this  excellent  book,  but  they  have  not  given  it  the  editorial  care   which  it  deserves.

"  Outlook   Contemptible  film,  but  use  it  to  our  advantage   RABBI  David  Elcott  of  the  American  Jewish  Committee  put  it  well:   “The  movie  undermines  the  sense  of  community  that  has  existed  between  Jews  and  Christianity  for  decades.  It  makes  it  more  important  than  ever  for  Christians  and  Jews  to  reassert  their  dedication  to  interfaith  harmony”   Clearly,  that  is  the  single  most  critical  issue  to  emerge  from  The  Passion  of  The  Christ,  Mel  Gibson’s  contentious  film  on  the  last  12  hours  of  Jesus’  life.   The  crux  of  the  problem,  the  core  issue,  is  that  the  film  outrageously  and  obscenely  restores  legitimacy  to  the  notion  that  the  Jews  were,  and  are,  responsible  for  the  death  of  Jesus  -  a  notion  which  the  Vatican  officially   renounced  in  1965  in  its  historic  reforms  known  as  Nostra  Aetate.   '  The  enormous  significance  of  those  reforms  -  overturning  almost  2000   years  of  Church  teaching  and  Christian  theology  -  have  been  a  key  factor  in  the  greatly-improved  relations  between  Jews  and  Christians.   Yet  here  is  Gibson,  with  Hollywood  technicolour  at  its  most  graphic  -  at  one  point  the  entire  screen  is  taken  up  by  Jesus’  lacerated  eyes  and  nostrils  -  presenting  the  world  with  a  falsified  version  of  history  which,  if  left  unchal  lenged,  has  the  potential  to  re-ignite  tension  in  Christian-Jewish  relations.   Quite  understandably,  Jews  have  been  concerned  at  the  possible  fallout  from  the  film’s  wicked  message  -  that  it  was  the  bloodthirsty  Jewish  mob  that  was  guilty  of  causing  the  death  of  Jesus,  and  that  the  crime  of  deicide  is  a  stain  and  a  curse  which  the  Jews  are  burdened  to  wear  for  all  time.   There  can  be  no  more  heinous  crime  than  killing  a  god,  and  it  is  this  false  allegation,  more  than  any  other  single  factor,  which  has  underpinned  &amp;lt;■  -  centuries  of  antisemitism,  and  indeed  the  Holocaust.  The  credence  which   this  film  restores  to  it  as  it  is  watched  by  millions  must  therefore  be  vigorously  rebutted  -  not  just  by  Jews,  but  by  the  Church.   THE  potential  damage  which  The  Passion  can  wreak  is  exacerbated  by  its   timing  -  both  in  terms  of  what  has  been  happening  globally  and  what  is  about  to  happen  at  the  Vatican.   It  has  opened  worldwide  at  a  time  when  expressions  of  antisemitism  have  reached  epidemic  proportions.  Its  injurious  portrayal  of  Jews  can  only  aggravate  the  situation.   Related  to  that  is  the  fact  that  the  Catholic  Church  is  approaching  the  post-John  Paul  II  era,  which  means  a  struggle  is  under  way  over  the  direction  the  Church  will  take  under  the  next  pope.   Most  specifically,  there  is  concern  over  whether  the  new  pontiff  will  maintain  the  emphasis  on  Jewish-Catholic  dialogue  which  has  been  a  feature  of  the  tenure  of  the  incumbent  -  the  first  pope  to  enter  a  synagogue  when  he  visited  the  Rome  Synagogue  20  years  ago  —  and  whether  he  will  persist  with  the  reforms  of  Nostra  Aetate.   Certainly,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  The  Passion  is  just  a  film.  Yet  it  is  claimed  that  the  Pope  commented:  “It  is  as  it  was”;  one  of  his  aides  has  denied  this,  however,  saying  the  Pope  “does  not  give  judgments  on  art”.   Indeed,  the  film  is  art,  prompting  the  argument  that  as  an  artist,  Gibson  has  the  right  to  call  it  as  he  sees  it.  Democratic  freedoms  come  with  responsibility,  however,  and  while  Gibson  may  maintain  with  sincerity  that  ^  neither  he  nor  his  film  is  antisemitic,  such  a  claim  is  meaningless  for,  to   borrow  from  what  the  Pope  allegedly  said,  the  film  is  as  it  is  -  noxious,  contemptible,  inflammatory  and  irresponsible.   Inevitably,  it  has  drawn  attention  to  absurd  remarks  by  Gibson’s  mother,  Joye  Gibson,  that  the  Holocaust  was  a  fabrication  whereby  German  Jews  were  sent  to  the  Middle  East  to  fight  the  Arabs,  and  by  his  father,  Hutton  Gibson,  that  Nostra  Aetate  was  a  Jewish  plot.   While  these  are  offensive,  they  are  a  sideshow.  The  name  of  the  game  is  Jewish-Christian  relations.  The  film’s  equally  offensive  message  should  be  turned  into  an  opportunity  for  increased  dialogue  and  improved  relations. ",2004-02-27

"  The  origins  of  Hatikvah   ASK  THE  RABBI   RAYMOND  APPLE   What  is  the  origin  of   Hatikvah?  Is  it  really  by  a  drunken  poet?   Don’t  denigrate  any  poem  on   the  basis  that  the  author  may   have  had  bouts  of  alcoholism.   Misery  often  seems  to  dog  the  poet   ic  soul.   The  words  are  by  Naftali  Herz  Imber,  put  together  in  Romania  in  1878  or  in  Rishon  in  1882,  and  the  song  was  first  published  in  1886.   It  was  put  to  music  by  Shmuel  Cohen  of  Rishon  LeZion,  a  former  Moldavian,  and  became  popular  among  the  settlers  in  the  early  Zion   ist  colonies.  The  Zionist  movement   adopted  it  as  their  anthem  and  it  inevitably  became  the  anthem  of  the   State  of  Israel.   The  text  underwent  changes  over  the  years.  Imber’s  original  text  of  the   refrain  was:   Od  lo  av’dah  tikvatenu  -  Our  hope  is   not  yet  lost,   Hatikvah  hanoshanah  -  The  age-old   hope,   Lashuv  el  eretz  avotenu  -  To  return   to  the  land  of  out  fathers,   La’ir  bah  David  chanah  -  To  the  city   where  David  dwelt.   The  poem  originally  had  four  verses  and  a  refrain,  with  an  inter  esting  reference  to  God  in  the  third  verse:  “Ki  od  y’rachamenu  E-l  zo’em  -  That  an  angry  God  will  yet  have  mercy  upon  us.”   The  Hebrew  words  of  Imber  s   version  fit  together  well,  but  appear  to  be  based  on  well-known  non   Jewish  nationalist  themes,  especially  the  “as  long  as”  motif.   The  music  is  also  partly  bor  rowed  from  outside  sources,  for  example  a  liturgical  melody  for   Psalm  117  in  Hallel  and  a  Molda  vian-Romanian  folk  tune,  Carul  cu  Boi  -  Cart  and  Oxen,  which  itself  utilises  a  widely-known  melodic  style  which  the  composer  Smetana   made  famous.   So  popular  did  the  tune  of  Hatik  vah  become  among  religious  Zion  ists  that  they  often  used  it  for  Psalm  126  (Shir  HaMa’alot)  in  the  Grace  After  Meals,  though  I  recall  an  Israeli  diplomat  in  Australia  who  undiplomatically  objected  to  the  “sacred”  Hatikvah  melody  being  “cheapened”  in  the  bensching!   Imber  had  a  traditional  educa   tion  in  Eastern  Europe  and  became  secretary  to  Laurence  Oliphant,  the   Christian  Zionist.   After  some  years  in  Palestine  he  went  back  to  Europe  and  at  various  times  lived  in  India,  England  and   the  United  States.   In  the  US  he  lived  in  misery  and  alcoholism.  He  had  married  a  Christian  intellectual  who  convert  ed  to  Judaism  for  him,  but  the  mar  riage  did  not  last.   He  wrote  poetry  and  translated  Omar  Khayyam  into  Hebrew.  He  produced  English  renderings  of  some  of  his  poems  and  wrote  some  talmudic  leaflets  in  English.   Reprinted  from  Rabbi  Raymond   Apple’s  email  list:   oztorah@hotmail.com.

"  Jim  Caviezel  as  Jesus  in  Mel  Gibson’s  The  Passion  of  the  Christ   Controversial  nun  beatified   ROME  —  The  Catholic  Church  has  beatified  a  19th-century  German  nun  who  inspired  Mel  Gibson  in  making  The  Passion  of  the  Christ.   After  the  death  of  Anna  Katharina  Emmerick  in  1824,  grisly  visions  of  the  torturing  of  Jesus  were  attributed  to  her  in  a  book,  The  Dolorous  Passion  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.   Emmerick  was  honoured  for  her  virtuous  fife  and  the  visions  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  honour.  But  the  Anti-Defamation  League,  which  accused  The  Passion  of  fostering  anti  semitism,  expressed  “deep  distress”  and  said  the  beatification  could  “harm  Christian-Jewish  relations”.   Beatification  is  the  last  step  before  Catholic  sainthood.  Emmerick  was  one  of  five  people  beatified  by  the  Pope  last  Sunday.  JTA ",2004-10-08
"  School's  in  for  Betano   .  '  School  will  soon  be  in  at  a  new  and  improved  facility  at  remote  Gawa  on  Elcho  Island  .thanks  to  some  help  from  the   Navy.  The  parents  of  30  primary  and  secondary  aged  students  at  the  indigenous  homeland  ""community  town  of  Gawa  have  pressed  for  improvements  to  the  community  school  in  the  Northern  Territory.  Since  February  of  this  year  the  students  have  attended  lessons  in  temporary  premises.  The  school,  the  Gawa  Christian  School,  is  a  member  of  the  Northern  Territory  Christian  Schools  Association  (NTCSA).  Getting  building  materials  for  a  new  school  and  some  water  tanks  to  provide  potable  water  for  the  children,  is  a  problem,  however,  because  of  the  shallows  off  the  vil  lage  and  lack  of  a  wharf.  Now  the  Navy  has  achieved  an  almost  impossible  task.  A  chance  meeting  on  a  plane  between  the  commanding  officer  of  the  heavy  landing  craft,  HMAS  Betano,  LCDR  Michael  Oborn,  and  the  chief  executive  officer  of  the  NTCSA,  Jack  Mechielsen,  lead  to  a  Defence  Aid  to  the  Civil  Community  request,  going  to  Maritime  Headquarters.  That  request  was  for  Betano  to  take  and  land  building  materials  and  some  water  tanks,  to  Gawa.  .  It  was  given  the  ""green  light.""  The  tanks  and  equipment  were  loaded  in  Darwin  and  the  landing   craft  headed  for  Gawa  arriving  on  November  6.  The  plan  was  to  land  the  equip  ment  on  the  beach  in  front  of  the  village.  LCDR  Oborn  realised  the  only  way  to  do  this  was  on  a  full  high  tide.  Even  then  Betano  would  only  be  able  to  get  to  within  100  metres  of  the  shoreline.  ""But  the  crew  did  not  despair  that  the  forklift  waiting  on  the  beach  would  not  be  able  to  reach  the  load,""  LEUT  Peter  Taylor,   Betano  's  executive  officer,  told  Navy  News.  ""The  large  water  tanks  were  rolled  out  of  the  bow  door,  into  the  water  and  floated  across.  ""A  line  was  passed  ashore  and  secured  to  the  nearest  tree.  The  children  thought  it  was  so  funny  we  Betano  didn't  float  away.  ""The  rope  allowed  an  alumini  um  dingy  loaded  with  materials  to  be  dragged  across  the  water  gap.  ""Once  the  tide  had  receded  and  Betano  dried  out,  the  ship's   company  continued  off-loading  by  hand,  taking  the  equipment  across  to  where  the  forklift  waited.  ""Eleven  tonnes  of  building'  materials  were  unloaded  by  hand  over  a  five-hour  period  of  very  hard  work,""  LEUT  Taylor  said.  The  indigenous  community  has  no  mains  electricity,  no  reticulated  water  and  no  comer  store.  Never-the-less  it  wanted  its  children  to  have  a  good  education  in  a  proper  school  building.  It  is  going  to  get  its'wish.

"  Jewish  communal  fundraising  was  strong  even  150  years  ago   SICHAT  YOSEF   YOSSIARON   It  seems  clear  that  Australian  Jewish  philanthropic   prominence,  especially  in  regard  to  communal  facilities,  has  a  long  history.   THIS  month  the  Age  marked  the   150th  anniversary  of  its  estab  lishment  by  publishing  a  fac  simile  copy  of  its  first  edition  which  featured  an  article  headed  “Religious   statistics”   There  were  50  clergy  at  the  helm  of  the  Church  of  England,  42  Presby  terians,  26  Catholics,  a  host  of  repre   sentatives  of  smaller  denominations  and  one  Jewish  minister.   He  was  Rev  Moses  Rintel,  the  teacher,  shochet,  mohel  and  reader  appointed  to  Melbourne  Hebrew  Congregation  in  1849.   Similarly  under  the  heading  “Places  of  worship”,  the  Church  of  England  was  found  to  have  11  churches  plus  41  temporary  locations  (presumably  mainly  on  the  gold  fields),  the  Wesleyans  had  even  more,  the  Catholics  had  18,  but  the  Jews  had  just  one.  This  would  have  been  the  original  home  of  Melbourne  Hebrew  Congregation,  then  located   in  Bourke  Street   But  the  biggest  surprise  was  to  be  found  under  “voluntary  contribu  tions”.  A  table  of  the  funds  raised  by  congregations  during  the  last  year  which  indicated  “the  activity  which  all  have  displayed  in  providing  for  the  extension  of  religious  institutions”.   These  figures  were  quite  surpris  ing.  The  total  for  the  Church  of  Eng  land  was  £24,000,  Wesleyans  raised  £30,000,  Presbyterians  £32,000  and  the  Jews  raised  £9000.   The  surprise  arises  from  the  fact  that  the  total  Victorian  (white)  popu  lation,  according  to  the  census  of  1851,  was  just  over  77,000  of  which  only  600  were  stated  to  be  Jews.   While  by  1854  the  population  was  believed  to  have  quadrupled  to  280,000,  even  if  there  had  been  a  dis  proportionate  increase  in  the  num  ber  of  Jews,  they  still  comprised  only  a  tiny  percentage  of  the  total.   Yet  the  amount  they  had  collected  for  what  was  actually  the  rebuilding   of  the  overcrowded  Bourke  Street  premises  was  a  substantially  more  sig  nificant  amount  per  head  than  char  acterised  the  rest  of  the  population.   It  seems  clear  that  Australian  Jew  ish  philanthropic  prominence,  espe  cially  in  regard  to  communal  facilities,  has  a  long  history.   A  further  issue  which  appears  in   that  article  is  that  of  state  aid.  Refer   ence  is  made  to  amounts  of  money  which  were  voted  by  the  Legislative   Council  for  distribution  to  the  vari  ous  Christian  denominations.   While  we  are  used  to  referring  to  state  aid  in  the  context  of  money  made  available  to  the  mainly  denom  inational  private  schools,  in  those  early  days  the  term  had  a  much   broader  connotation.   A  British  parliamentary  act  of  1836  empowered  the  provision  of  assistance  for  ministers  of  religion  and  for  building  houses  of  Christian  worship.   These  provisions  incorporated  in  New  South  Wales  legislation  in  1842  referred  to  public  worship  -  without  including  the  word  “Christian”.   Although  the  Sydney  Jewish  com  munity  received  £1000  to  liquidate  the  debt  on  their  synagogue,  secre  tary  of  state  Earl  Grey  said  that  he  regretted  the  proposal.   However,  when  Melbourne  Hebrew  Congregation  sought  £500  in  1850  towards  its  first  synagogue,  the  request  was  refused  on  the  basis  of  Earl  Grey’s  view,  despite  the  fact  that  public  opinion  and  the  press  were  in  favour  of  equal  treatment  for  Jews.   Interestingly  even  some  of  the  opposition  in  parliament  to  that  pro  vision  of  aid  was  not  specifically  directed  at  Jews  per  se.   In  an  indication  of  contemporary  prejudice  it  was  said  that  the  objec  tion  was  based  more  on  precedent  for  applications  by  “Hindus,  Moham   metans  and  socialists”.   In  a  colony  where  sentiment  was  more  liberal  than  that  in  England,  state  aid  became  a  major  issue  in  the  Victorian  Legislative  Assembly  elec   tion  of  1856.   Initially  grants  to  Jews  were  stymied  by  the  conservative  Legisla  tive  Council.  Finally  from  1859  a  sum  of  £2000  per  annum  was  provided  for  the  “Victorian  Jewish  Communi  ty”.  Funding  continued  until  1870,  when  denominational  grants  were  phased  out.   Similarly  fundings  to  religious  organisations  for  the  operation  of  educational  institutions  ceased  from  1873  as  a  result  of  the  passing  of  the  “free  compulsory  and  secular”  Educa   tion  Act  Under  that  act  all  denomina   tional  schools  (including  Melbourne’s  19th-century  Jewish  dayschool),  ceased  to  receive  any  state  aid.   All  schools  had  to  fund  themselves  or  go  out  of  operation  -  a  situation  which  applied  until  the  reintroduction  of  state  aid  at  federal  level  in  the  1960s.   It  is  noteworthy  that  although  the  Jewish  school  in  Ballarat  dosed,  Mel  bourne  Hebrew  School,  associated  with  Melbourne  Hebrew  Congrega  tion,  continued  to  operate  in  various  guises  until  1895.   It  closed  in  that  year  in  the  context  of  a  serious  economic  depression  which  affected  many  communal  fam  ilies  making  them  unable  to  pay  fees.   Following  its  closure,  the  three  main  congregations  (Melbourne,  East  Melbourne  and  St  Kilda)  united  to  form  the  United  Jewish  Education  Board  to  provide  part-time  educa  tion  -  a  function  that  it  (like  Sydney’s  Academy  BJE)  still  carries  out  today  when  once  again  so  many  cannot  afford  school  fees  despite  today’s  lev   els  of  state  aid.

"  Getting  out  of  the  cage  to  combat  antisemitism   VIEWPOINT   DAWN  COHEN   Most  Australians  equate  antisemitism  only  with  concentration  camps.   No  threats  of  extinction  or  camps?  No  antisemitism.   THERE  is  a  psychological  phe   nomenon  called  learned  help  lessness.  If  you  cage  an  animal  for  long  enough,  and  then  open  the   door,  it  will  not  leave  its  raminar   prison.   Christian  antisemitism  used  pul  pit  attacks  and  social  apartheid  to  iso  late  Jews  from  non-Jews.  The  only  avenue  for  protection  against  pogroms  was  to  align  with  the  power  ful  -  the  lords  and  kings  -  placing  us  under  their  control  and  vulnerable  to  their  whims.   After  millennia  of  conditioning,  we  continue  to  believe  that  safety  lies  in  alliance  with  the  most  powerful  —   the  authorities  or  the  US  Govern   ment  -  while  the  people  are  not  to  be  trusted.  We  cite  evidence  of  ordinary  people  turning  against  us,  but  despite  historic  betrayals  by  governments  and  authorities,  we  continue  to  believe  in  their  goodwill.   Those  lords  and  kings,  in  cahoots  with  the  Church,  taught  us  that  anti  semitism  is  a  universal  force  and  that  we  can  never  change  it.  Our  best  bet  was  to  rely  on  their  mercy  in  contain  ing  it  -  which  they  would  happily  provide  in  return  for  services  and   money.   We  still  expect  salvation  from  con  temporary  kings,  but  talk  about  changing  antisemitism  to  your  aver  age  Aussie  Jew  and  their  eyes  glaze  over.  “There  will  always  be  anti  semitism;  there  is  nothing  you  can   do,”  they  invariably  comment   In  fact,  social  prejudices  can  and  do  change  when  there  are  planned  attempts  to  shift  them  -  amply  demonstrated  by  the  extraordinary   shifts  in  attitudes  to  women  and  homosexuals  over  the  past  30  years.   But  social  prejudice  does  not  shift  through  alliances  with  the  powerful;  it  shifts  through  strategic  campaigns  of  exposing  the  humanness  of  the  vic  tims  to  ordinary  people  and  in  explaining  the  subtle  manifestations  of  the  prejudice  from  a  vulnerable  but  contained  position.   If  ordinary  people  are  not  reached,  they  experience  our  alliances  with  the  powerful  as  undermining  their  rights.   Reaching  the  people  means  teach  ing  what  to  you  may  seem  obvious.  Most  Australians  equate  antisemitism  with  concentration  camps.  No  threats  of  extinction  or  camps?  No  anti   semitism.   Byron  Bay  leftists  cannot  see  their  own  antisemitism  because  they  know  they  are  not  Nazis.   We  must  strategically  and  patient  ly  teach  ourselves  and  Australia  that  antisemitism,  like  sexism,  embraces  a  spectrum  of  prejudice  from  the   extremes  of  murder  to  subtle,  unin  tentional  devaluation.  Also  like  sex  ism,  antisemitism  has  seeped  into  Anglo-Christian  and  Muslim  culture  and  language  so  that  everyone  unwit  tingly  absorbs  it   In  this  context  we  must  be  very   specific  in  identifying  the  precise  boundary  between  appropriate  cri  tique  of  the  Israeli  Government  and  antisemitism.  We  are  so  used  to  living  with  Angio-Christian  antisemitism,  it  is  like  gravity.  It  feels  so  normal,  we  don’t  notice  it  Identifying  it  in  words  is  as  awkward  as  exercising  a  never   used  muscle.   If  we  don’t  follow  this  path  and  simply  lobby  the  authorities  to  silence  antisemitic  left-wing  rhetoric,  the  Australian  people  will  have  no  idea  as   to  our  real  motives  and  will  see  us  as   bullies.  We  cannot  expect  change  without  creating  understanding.   Legal  action  against  sexism  only  gained  support  from  the  community   after  decades  of  debate  on  what  con  stitutes  sexism  and  what  does  not.   Even  the  chauvinists  can  now  identify  the  subtleties  that  render  some  jokes  sexist,  although  they  defend  their  right  to  crack  them.   Who  then  is  best  placed  to  do  the  required  work?  There  are  some  peo  ple  innately  and  passionately  driven  to  confront  inequity  in  all  its  forms.  Generally,  we  call  them  leftists.  They   can  be  uncomfortable  to  have  around   -  they  ask  difficult  questions,  they  never  toe  the  line  and  often  get  the  wrong  end  of  the  stick.   By  the  same  token,  if  they  identify  with  you,  they  will  also  question  those  who  are  prejudiced  against  you  and  similarly  refuse  to  toe  your  oppres   sor’s  line.   Australian  Jews,  discomforted  by  left-wing  Jews  and  their  annoying  views,  have  pushed  them  to  the  fringes  of  our  community.  We  do  not  trust  ourselves  with  their  questions.  Instead,  we  threaten  them  with  traitor  status  when  they  depart  too  far  from  our  perspective.   Consequently,  radical-left  Jews  don’t  feel  a  safe  belonging  in  the  Jew  ish  community.  When  they  hear  sub  tie  antisemitism  at  peace  rallies  or  political  meetings,  they  remain  silent,  partly  because  they  have  no  answers  as  the  Jewish  community  has  not  allowed  them  to  pose  the  questions,  and  partly  because  we  have  told  them  they  are  not  the  full  Jewish  quid.   If  we  want  to  combat  contempo  rary  antisemitism  at  its  roots,  we  must  walk  free  of  our  cage.  From  a  contained  but  vulnerable  stance,  we  must  find  words  for  the  subtle  anti   semitism  of  everyday  life  and  atti  tudes,  and  we  must  share  that  understanding  with  the  Australian  people.   We  must  have  faith  that  allowing  diversity  of  opinion  within  our  com  munity  will  ultimately  strengthen  our  capacity  to  respond  to  difficult  ques  tions  raised  by  outsiders.  From  that   faith  we  must  welcome  back  to  our  community  our  own  experts  in  con  fronting  prejudice:  radical-left  Jews.

"  A  tale  of  interfaith  dialogue  in  two  cities   VIEWPOINT   PETA  JONES  PELLACH   Interfaith  dialogue  is  just  one  means  of  creating  greater  understanding,  but  it  is  possibly  the  most  potent   THE  concept  of  the  common   “Abrahamic”  heritage  of  Chris  tians,  Muslims  and  Jews  may  be  more  important  to  promote  in  Aus  tralia  today  than  at  any  time  past.   As  the  Muslim  population  grows   in  influence  at  the  same  time  as  mis   trust  of  Muslims  among  Christians  reaches  a  zenith,  the  interests  of  the  Jewish  community  lie  in  communica  tion  and  co-operation  with  moderate  sections  of  that  community.   As  the  influence  of  Mel  Gibson  and  other  fundamentalist  Christians  pene  trates  secular  Australian  suburbia,  we  need  strong  bonds  with  those  in  the  Christian  world  who  respect  our  tra   dition  and  value  our  differences.   I  have  been  involved  in  interfaith  dialogue  conducted  under  the  aus  pices  of  the  Executive  Council  of  Aus  tralian  Jewry,  forging  links  with  churches  and  Muslim  organisations.   It  is  not  always  easy.  Consider  the  question  of  “Covenant”.   Considering  that  Christians  have  a  different  take  and  that  Muslims  use   different  terminology  for  their  rela  tionship  with  the  Divine,  and  acknowledging  that  there  is  diver  gence  within  Jewish  thought,  suggest  ing  there  is  a  Jewish  understanding  of  “Covenant”  may  be  disingenuous.  That  is  the  type  of  discussion  inter  faith  dialogue  demands.   We  also  participate  in  responses  to  political  or  social  issues.  While  we  are   happy  to  condemn  injustice,  it  can  become  sticky  if  the  intention  is  to  vilify  Israel.   When  it  comes  to  matters  of  bioethics,  it  is  not  unusual  to  find  that  the  intention  is  to  present  the  faith  groups  as  united  in  a  conservative  position  which  in  no  way  resembles  the  complexity  of  the  Jewish  approach.   Despite  the  problems,  the  benefits  of  dialogue  outweigh  the  difficulties.   The  opportunity  to  participate  in  two  interfaith  conferences  in  succes  sive  weeks  presented  itself  when  the  Jewish  communities  of  Melbourne  and  Sydney  respectively  joined  Mus  lim  and  Christian  groups  to  host  scholars  in  an  exploration  of  our  heritage  as  “Children  of  Abraham”.   The  first,  in  Melbourne,  was  billed  as  “International  Inter-Religion:  Abra  ham  Conference”.  Dr  Devorah  Weiss  man,  The  Shalom  Institutes  scholar-in-residence,  featured  in  the  opening  panel.  Kosher  food  was  pro  vided.  Topics  were  crafted  to  avoid  offence.  The  feeling  was  one  of  joint  ownership  and  shared  legitimacy.   It  was  interesting  to  compare  the  Muslim  participants  in  Melbourne  with  the  Islamic  community  with  whom  we  work  in  Sydney.   Melbourne’s  Muslims  appeared  to  be  less  confident.  There  seemed  to  be  more  first-generation  Australians  and  few  from  outside  the  friendly  Turkish  community.  Even  my  controversial   topic  of  “Zionism”  drew  no  observ  able  hostility  and  elicited  interest.   The  Turkish-Muslim  organisation  Affinity  is  committed  to  interfaith  dia  logue.  As  the  sponsors  of  the  Sydney  conference,  they  were  interested  in  learning  the  Jewish  perspective  about  issues.  In  Sydney  the  Muslim  contin  gent  was  bolstered  by  second-genera   tion  Australians  and  a  number  from   Arab  countries.  Their  questions  were  more  aggressive,  although  no-one  deviated  from  respectful  interaction.   In  Sydney  there  was  less  considera  tion  for  the  Jewish  perspective  or  cul  tural  needs.  There  was  no  kosher  food.   The  topic  “Zionism”  was  listed  alongside  “Jihad”  and  “Crusades”  on  the  program  -  creating  the  impression  that  the  topics  were  linked  and  that  this,  too,  was  an  attempt  to  dominate   “non-believers”.   There  was  a  smaller  Jewish  contin  gent  than  in  Melbourne,  where  it  was  empowering  to  represent  the  Jewish  community.   Although  we  are  perceived  as  pow  erful  by  Christians  and  Muslims  in  both  cities,  the  sense  of  our  impor  tance  differs  between  the  Sydney  and   Melbourne  communities.   In  Melbourne  Jews  number  more  and  count  more.  Muslims  are  a  small  er  and  less  strident  community.  In  Sydney  we  have  a  strong  awareness  of  our  vulnerability  in  comparison  with  our  Muslim  counterparts.   Interfaith  dialogue  between  Mus  lims  and  Jews  is  more  sophisticated  in  Sydney  than  in  Melbourne.  It  is  when  we  become  aware  of  our  comparative  powerlessness  that  we  become  more  open  to  understanding  and  allies.   It  is  more  challenging  to  talk  to  Muslims  who  begin  with  concerns  about  us,  who  question  our  beliefs,  practices  and  links  with  Israel  than  with  those  who  hardly  know  us.   Many  Christians,  too,  are  suspi  cious  and  believe  we  have  power  beyond  our  numbers.  The  challenge  for  our  continuing  harmonious  acceptance  in  the  Australian  commu  nity  lies  in  forging  bonds  with  the  increasing  numbers  of  non-Jewish  Australians  who  might  be  our  oppo   nents  or  even  our  enemies.   Interfaith  dialogue  is  just  one  means  of  creating  greater  understand  ing,  but  it  is  possibly  the  most  potent.   Muslims  and  Christian  believers  respect  people  of  faith  and  those  who  are  loyal  to  their  own  traditions  more  than  they  respect  the  secular  and  potentially  value-less  society.   Those  who  have  the  commitment  to  our  traditions  that  enables  us  to   share  our  values  will  find  that  respect  and  friendship  can  be  earned  through  dialogue.

"  State  Government  donates  $500,000  to  restore  the  Great   MANDY  SACHER   THE  State  Government  has  donated  $500,000  to  the  Great  Synagogue.   The  announcement  by  Premier  Bob  Carr  was  the  high  point  of  the  launch  of  the  synagogue’s  125th  anniversary  Conservation  Appeal,   which  has  raised  $1.2  million  to  date.   Acknowledging  the  financial  con  straints  on  the  community  caused  by  the  threat  of  terrorism,  Carr  also  announced:  “I  have  made  representa  tion  to  Federal  Government  seeking  protection  for  the  synagogue  and  other  places  of  worship  under  the  Terrorism  Insurance  Act  because  the  burden  on  this  community  of  meeting  security  is  so  very  great.”   Turning  his  attention  to  the  need  to  preserve  the  Great  Synagogue  as  a  Sydney  icon,  he  said:  “It  is  the  year  of  the  built  environment,  a  time  when  we  are  taking  stock  of  prime  build  ings  and  structures  that  make  up  our  world  and  commit  ourselves  to  pro  tecting  them  for  future  generations.   “I  am  honoured  to  be  here  to  cele   brate  part  of  Sydney’s  architectural  heritage.

It  is  important  to  reflect   on  the  origins  of  the  Judaeo  Christian  tradition  in  this  country.”   The  Premier  commended  the  Jew  ish  community  for  being  “outspoken  on  refugee  rights  and  condemning  racism  in  any  form”.   “The  Great  Synagogue  stands  as  a  symbol  of  goodwill,”  he  said.   “When  I  have  mobilised  gatherings  to  bring  in  the  Islamic  community,  Christian  communities  and  Buddhists,  this  community  has  been  there  as  an  unwavering  voice  of  dialogue  for  stabil  ity  and  respect  between  cultures.”   Senior  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  welcomed  Carr  as  a  “warm  friend”  of  the  community,  and  synagogue  vice  president  Rosalind  Fischl  thanked  him  for  endorsing  the  appeal.   She  offered  him  a  key  to  the  shul,  inviting  him  to  return  “at  any  time”.

"  SELF-RESPECT   PETER  Kohn  (“Art,  truth  and  the  ‘Jew  ish  lobby”’  AJN  4/6/04)  fails  to  consid  er  the  two  most  important  reasons  why  we  should  confront  antisemitism  within  the  wider  community  rather   than  remain  silent.   First,  our  self-respect  as  Jews.  How  can  we  maintain  any  self-respect  with  out  voicing  our  concerns  regarding   matters  which  are  an  affront  to  us?   Second,  our  self-respect  as  Aus   tralians.   We  are  fortunate  to  live  in  a  Judeo  Christian  society  which  honours  our  heritage.  Why  should  we  cower  and  cringe  or  be  afraid  of  articulating  and  promoting  our  own  values?   It  is  true  that  the  “Jewish  lobby”  can  become  the  focus  of  negative  media  attention,  but  it  does  not  logically  fol  low  that  this  is  damaging  to  our  com  munity’s  relationship  with  the  wider  community.   This  conclusion  is  not  only  more  imagined  than  real,  it  is  extremely  patronising  of  the  wider  community  which  shows  far  more  goodwill  than  animosity  toward  us.

"  Israeli  museum  to   honour  Aussie  Diggers   PETER  KOHN   AN  Australian  woman  is  planning  to  raise  funds  for  a  museum  in  Be’er  Sheva  dedicated  to  the  role  that  Dig  gers  played  in  World  War  I  to  liber  ate  the  territory  that  later  became   Israel  from  the  Turks.   A  bold  and  courageous  charge  by  the  4th  Australian  Light  Horse  Brigade  to  wrest  control  of  Be’er  Sheva  and  its  strategic  biblical  water  wells  from  Turkish  troops  on  Octo  ber  31,  1917,  has  long  been  acclaimed  by  historians  as  a  critical  turning  point  in  the  Middle  Eastern  campaign  during  the  1914-18  war.   Jill  Curry,  the  Australian  co-ordi  nator  of  the  museum  project,  says  the  six-kilometre  charge  of  the  light  horsemen,  believed  to  have  been  the  last  cavalry  charge  in  history,  pan  icked  the  Turks  and  turned  the  tide  of  the  war,  culminating  a  few  weeks  later  in  the  Allied  sweep  into  Jerusalem  on  December  9,1917,  and  an  end  to  four  centuries  of  Ottoman  rule.   The  Allies  marched  into  Jerusalem  on  the  eve  of  Chanukah,  only  weeks  after  the  British  Govern   ment  issued  the  Balfour  Declaration,   promising  a  Jewish  homeland  in  Palestine,  said  Curry,  a  practising  Christian  who  seeks  to  further  links  between  Australia  and  Israel.   Around  800  light  horsemen,  mostly  young  men  from  rural  Aus  tralian  towns  in  the  fledgling  Com  monwealth,  braved  a  barrage  of  Turkish  artillery  fire  during  the  dar  ing  one-hour  assault  across  the  wadi   and  into  Be’er  Sheva.   “There  are  also  many  ANZACs  who  did  not  return  and  are  laid  to   rest  in  the  city  and  surrounding   The  old  Turkish  railway  station  in  Be’er  Sheva,  which  is  slated  to  become  the   museum   dedicated  to   Aussie  Diggers.   cemeteries.  This  [museum]  will  also  honour  the  memory  of  those  who  shed  their  blood  in  service  to  oth  ers,”  Curry  said.   She  said  it  was  an  hour  in  which  not  only  Australian  military  prowess  was  established  on  the  world  stage  but  which  paved  the  way  for  the  eventual   establishment  of  the  modem  nations  of  Israel,  Jordan,  Syria  and  Lebanon.   ‘The  six-kilometre  charge  of  the  light   horsemen,  believed  to  have  been  the  last  cavalry  charge  in  history,   panicked  the  Turks  and  turned  the  tide  of   World  War  I.”   JILL  CURRY  Australian  co-ordinator,  Be’er  Sheva  museum  project   Inspired  by  books  on  the  subject  by  prominent  Australian  Christian  historians  Kelvin  Crombie  and  Pas  tor  Colonel  Stringer  and  Israeli  mili  tary  artefacts  collector  Avraham  Zakai,  whose  collections  include  memorabilia  from  the  ANZACs  in  Palestine,  Curry  persuaded  Mayor  Yaacov  Temer  and  the  Be’er  Sheva  municipality  to  build  the  museum.   Work  on  the  museum,  which  will  be  partly  built  underground  to  protect  it  from  the  heat  of  the  Negev  Desert,  began  in  January  this   year.

"  Onward   By  Lachlan  Bickley   Recently,  on  his  popular  television  program  'The  700  Club',  American  evangelical  Christian  Pat  Robertson  called  for  the  assassination  of  Venezuelan  President  Hugo  Chavez.  Robertson  alleged  that  Chavez  was  'a  terrific  danger'  and  that  he  was  bent  on  exporting  Communism  and  Islamic  extremism  across  the  Americas  (which  was  somewhat  odd  given  that  those  two  ideologies  are  largely  antithetical  to  one  another).  Robertson  then  called  for  Spe   oicn  rui  oca  u|jciauvcs  iu  icn\c  imu  uui,  vviiion  vvao  111101  preted  by  most  observers  to  mean  that  he  should  be  as  sassinated.  Robertson  drew  a  link  between  the  war  in  Iraq  and  Chavez,  suggesting  that  as  with  Saddam,  the  US  may  find  itself  engaged  in  conflict  with  an  entire  nation  to  get  rid  of  one  man  at  some  stage  in  the  future.  Robertson  later  apologized  for  his  remarks  and  said  they  were  taken  out  of  context.  That  is  disgraceful.  A  man  of  such  strength  and  faith  such  as  Pat  Robertson  should  never  have  to  repent  anything  he  says  in  the  service  of  God.  Pat  Robertson  is  a  vessel  through  which  our  Lord  and  saviour  speaks  to  us.  Chavez  is  clearly  an  impious  infidel  and  is  a  clear  menace  to  all  God-fearing  Christians.  His  very  existence  is  a  threat  to  the  Christian  way  of  life,  not  just  in  the  US  but  through  out  the  world.  Thus  in  the  case  of  such  an  obviously  evil  man,  not  only  is  it  right  but  also  imperative  that  men  like  Pat  Robertson  stand  up  for  the  greater  community  and  call  for  his  removal  from  God's  earth.  It  is  this  very  last  point  that  is  at  the  crux  of  this  issue;  the  greater  community.  This  is  because  Pat  Robertson  does  indeed  speak  for  the  majority  in  the  US.  The  majority  of  citizens  of  the  US  identify  themselves  as  being  Christian  of  one  denomination  or  another,  and  thus  this  majority  has  a  right  to  have  its  voice  felt  on  moral  issues,  such  as  whether  or  not  to  assassinate  a  foreign  leader.  Indeed  there  are  very  few  areas  where  it  is  not  relevant  that  religious  con  siderations  be  taken  into  account.  After  all  God  made  this  earth  for  us  and  thus  anything  that  happens  here  should  reflect  his  desires.  The  US  has  begun  to  move  in  the  right  direction  by  giving  George  W  Bush  an  extended  time  in  the  White  House  and  hopefully  he  can  ensure  the  moral  future  of  that  country.  A  great  step  towards  achieving  this  will  be  if  he  can  indeed  load  the  Supreme  Court  with  more  right  thinking,  God-fearing  moralists  like  Antonin  Scalia.  This   will  help  that  country  eliminate  pernicious  threats  such  as  the  woman's  right  to  choose,  same  sex  marriages  and  other  immoral  pursuits  such  as,  gambling,  smoking,  drink  ing,  drugs  and  reality  TV.  That  will  allow  the  US  to  once  again  become  a  mighty  country,  strong  and  unified  under  God  and  with  a  clear  mandate  to  take  their  faith  to  the  rest  of  the  world.  Of  course  this  issue  has  relevance  to  us  here  in  Australia.  Australia  too  is  a  country  with  a  clear  (small),  majority  of  Christians  who  deserve  to  be  given  total  say  over  how  Australia  proceeds  in  confronting  the  challenges  to  faith  and  morals  that  the  modern  world  presents.  The  success  of  the  Family  First  party  in  the  last  federal  election  was  a  good  start  but  there  is  still  much  progress  to  be  made  in  making  this  country  the  Christian  stronghold  it  should  be.  For  example  our  Prime  Minister  claims  to  be  a  man  of  faith  however  he  still  allows  far  too  much  liberal  license  in  this  country.  For  example  there  is  the  question  about  funding  'Private  schools  need  every  dollar  they  can  get  to  help  create  our  Christian  war  riors  of  the  future,  whether  these  are  war  riors  of  the  battlefield  or  warriors  of  the  board  room.  Australia  cannot  hope  to  compete  with  the  heathen  forces  being  created  around  the  world  if  we  do  not  do  everything  we  can  to  support  our  best  and  brightest  '  of  religious  schools  that  periodically  rears  its  head.  This  questioning  should  not  be  tolerated.  It  is  difficult  to  see  why  anyone  could  possibly  complain  that  private  religious  schools  get  more  Federal  Government  money  than  pub  lic  schools  do.  These  institutions  need  every  dollar  they  can  get  to  help  create  our  Christian  warriors  of  the  future,  whether  these  are  warriors  of  the  battlefield  or  warriors  of  the  board  room.  Australia  cannot  hope  to  compete  with  the  heathen  forces  being  created  around  the  world  if  we  do  not  do  everything  we  can  to  support  our  best  and  brightest.  The  last  few  years  of  global  events  have  clearly  demon  strated  that  it  is  people  of  faith  that  will  take  this  centu  ry  by  the  throat  and  make  it  their  own.  All  of  the  major  events  of  the  last  few  years  can  be  traced  back  to  issues  of  faith  in  some  way.  The  war  on  terror  is  as  much  about  religion  as  anything  else.  Thus  to  prevent  Australia  becom  ing  swamped  in  this  global  struggle  we  need  to  reject  the  amorphous  doctrines  of  multi-culturalism  and  tolerance  and  embrace  religious  certainty.  It  is  obvious  that  this  is  the  best  way  forward;  we  can't  risk  having  a  future  Pat  Robertson  calling  for  the  head  our  PM  because  he  can't  live  up  to  the  Christian  ideal.

"  STARS  OF  DAVID  CROSS  CHRISTIAN  BUNS   HOT  cross  buns  may  be  all  the  rage  as  the  Christian  festival  of  Easter  approaches,  but  one  eastern  sub  urbs  cafe  owner  has  decided  to  play  to  his  market  by  turning  the  Christian-themed  buns  into  “Jew  ish”  ones.

The  Youth  Encounters  Forum,  an  initiative  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  along  with  Affinity  Intercultural  Foundation,  brings  students  of  different  religions  together  to  promote  harmony.  In  its  second  year,  the  conference  has  dou  bled  in  size,  uniting  120  students  from  six  faith-based  high  schools  in  NSW,  compared  to  60  students  from  three  schools  at  last  year’s  confer   ence.   “Today  was  a  great  success,  espe  cially  in  the  political  climate  of  today.  It  is  inspiring  to  see  120  high  school  students  coming  together  and  talking  about  religion  in  Aus  tralia,”  project  pioneer  and  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  Commu  nity,  Youth  and  Education  officer  Josh  Levin  said.   Terrorism,  Jews  for  Jesus  and  reli   gious  stereotyping  were  among  the  topics  addressed  during  workshops  held  throughout  the  day.  There  was   also  a  focus  on  conflict  resolution.   Students  were  divided  into  groups  with  members  of  each  faith  and  a  group  facilitator.  Each  group  was  encouraged  to  discuss  the  pre  conceptions  they  had  about  other  religious  groups.  The  sessions  aimed  to  break  down  stereotypes  held  through  discussion  and  debate.   “At  the  end  of  the  day,  we  under  stood  each  other’s  religions  a  bit  bet  ter;  I  don’t  blame  them  anymore  for  what  is  happening  in  the  Middle  East,”  Khaled  Jaben,  a  Muslim  stu  dent,  told  the  AJN.   Students  spent  the  six  weeks  pre  ceding  the  forum  studying  religious  groups,  as  well  as  their  own.  The  day  afforded  an  opportunity  to  test  and  expand  that  knowledge.   “The  most  incredible  part  of  the  day  was  that  we  could  actually  meet  people  of  other  religions.  We  never  would  have  met  these  people  if  it   hadn’t  been  for  this  program,”   Emanuel  School  student  Daniella  Cohen  said.   “It  allowed  us  to  fight  against  the  stereotypes  and  realise  that  they  are  not  all  terrorists,”  added  Victoria  Fridman.   NSW  Premier  Morris  lemma   addressed  the  students  at  the  closing  ceremony  and  commended  the  ini   tiative.   “In  these  times,  we  must  do  everything  possible  to  nurture  and  promote  greater  understanding  between  cultural  groups.  It  is  an  essential  building  block  in  a  truly  tolerant  society.  This  is  a  clear  sign  that  our  youth  is  committed  to  tak  ing  a  leadership  role  in  promoting  interfaith  harmony,”  lemma  said.   The  Jewish  schools  that  partici  pated  were  Masada  College  and  the  Emanuel  School;  the  Muslim  Schools  were  Noor  Al-Houda  Islam   ic  College  and  Sule  College.

"  Another  church   supports   divestment   SAM  SER   ATLANTA  -  Jewish  and  Christian  activists  were  fuming  after  the  American-based  United  Church  of  Christ  (UCC)  voted  to  adopt  a  resolution  urging  divestment  from  Israel  during  its  biennial  general  synod  held  last  week  in  Atlanta,  Georgia.   Dexter  Van  Zile,  a  vocal  anti-divest  ment  activist  within  the  UCC,  decried  the  fact  that  the  language  of  the  resolu  tion  was  changed  after  a  compromise  had  been  struck  to  eschew  divestment;  and  that  -  despite  the  ambiguous  lan  guage  involved  -  the  resolution  could  be  construed  as  a  one-sided  attack  on  Israel.   The  decision  follows  similar  resolu  tions  adopted  in  recent  months'  by  the  American  Presbyterian  Church  and  the  British  Anglican  Church.   The  new  resolution  calls  upon  UCC  affiliated  ministries  and  bodies  to  ""use  economic  leverage  including,  but  not  limited  to,  advocating  the  reallocation  of  US  foreign  aid  so  that  the  militarisation  of  the  Middle  East  is  constrained;  mak  ing  positive  contributions  to  groups  and  partners  committed  to  the  non-violent  resolution  of  the  conflict;  challenging  the  practices  of  corporations  that  gain  from  the  continuation  of  the  conflict;  and  divesting  from  those  companies  that  refuse  to  change  their  practices  of  gain  from  the  perpetuation  of  violence,  including  the  occupation.”   Van  Zile  said  ""This  is  a  script  deliv  ered  in  Durban,  where  the  key  goal  was  to  start  the  labelling  of  Israel  as  an  apartheid  state,  with  all  the  implica  tions,  and  to  really  marginalise  and  minimise  antisemitism  as  an  interna  tional  concern,”  he  continued.   “At  their  last  synod  [two  years  ago],  the  UCC  was  the  only  major  Christian  group  that  came  out  with  a  very  power  ful  condemnation  of  antisemitism  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic.  The  passing  of  this  resolution  makes  a  mockery  of  the  last  one.

"  RELIGIOUS  LEADERS  SPLIT  OVER  TSUNAMI   ORYANA  KAUFMAN   IN  the  aftermath  of  one  of  the  world’s  worst  natural  disasters,  Jewish,  Christ-  ian  and  Muslim  religious  leaders  are   divided  about  whether  or  not  the   tsunami  was  God’s  punishment.   Either  way,  the  tsunami  was  indis-  criminate.  It  wiped  out  Buddhist,  Hindu,  and  Muslim  villages  in  Sri  Lanka  and  India,  inflicted  enormous  casualties  in  mostly  Islamic  Indonesia,  and  devastated  parts  of  predominant-  ly  Buddhist  Thailand,  where  Christian  and  Jewish  holidaymakers  also  per-   ished.   Sydney’s  Temple  Emanuel  Wool-  lahra  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Kamins  was  one  of  the  Jewish  leaders  “horrified”  by  Anglican  Dean  of  Sydney  Phillip  Jensen’s  searing  comments  last  week  that  the  tsunami  was  a  “warning  that  judgement  is  coming”.   “God  forbid  that  this  was  an  act  of   God.  I’m  horrified  when  I  hear  people  talk  of  this  being  Gods  will  in  a  form  of  judgement  and  punishment.  I  find  that  an  extraordinary  statement  of  human  arrogance  to  say  such  things,”  Rabbi  Kamins  told  the  AJN.   “All  our  scientific  understanding  of   the  universe  teaches  us  that  nature  is   amoral  and  that  life  is  dangerous  and  unfair,”  he  added.   But  Rabbinical  Council  of  Victoria   acting  president  Rabbi  Meir  Shlomo  Kluwgant  said  he  doesn’t  believe  the  tsunami  was  a  freak  act  of  nature;  rather  that  “it  has  a  purpose”.   “God  is  in  control.  There  is  provi-  dence  in  everything  that  occurs.  To  suggest  we  understand  why  God  does  these  things  is  beyond  our  realm,”  Rabbi  Kluwgant  said.   Rabbinical  Council  of  NSW  presi-  dent  Rabbi  Yoram  Ulman  agreed:   “Nothing  in  this  world  happens  as  a  freak  accident;  everything  comes  from   God.”   One  of  Israel’s  chief  rabbis,  howev-  er,  described  the  tsunami  as  divine  ret-  ribution.  “This  is  an  expression  of  God’s  ire  with  the  world,”  Sephardi   chief  Rabbi  Shlomo  Amar  told  Reuters  last  week.   “The  world  is  being  punished  for  wrongdoings  -  be  it  people’s  needless  hatred  of  each  other,  lack  of  charity  and  moral  turpitude.”   But  the  emeritus  rabbi  at  Mel-   bourne’s  Temple  Beth  Israel,  Rabbi  John  Levi,  said  he  was  “embarrassed”  by  such  remarks,  which  he  said  “turn   God  into  the  devil  or  Satan”.

Anthony  Grigor-Scott,  who  writes  material  on  the  Bible  Believ  ers  website,  admitted  in  court  to  being  responsible  for  the  material.  When  asked  if  he  had  changed  his  opinions,  he  told  the  court  he  had  “not  changed  my  views”.   The  case  against  the  Bible  Believers  was  brought  by  the  Exec  utive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  after  it  appealed  to  the  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Oppor  tunity  Commission  last  year,  claim  ing  some  of  the  material  breached  the  Racial  Discrimination  Act.   ECAJ  president  Grahame  Leonard  said  the  material  on  the   website  is  “disgusting,  offensive  and  hurtful”.  This  is  the  second  case  the  ECAJ  has  initiated  against  racial   hatred  on  the  internet.  It  won  its  case  against  Adelaide  Institute’s  Dr  Fredrick  Toben  in  2003  when  the  judge  ruled  that  Dr  Toben  must  purge  the  offensive  material  from   his  site.

National  Council  of  Churches  in  Aus-  tralia  president  Professor  James  Haire,  co-  ordinating  the  launch  last  week,  said:  “We   want  to  get  completely  away  from  any  one’s  mind  that  Christian  money  simply  goes  to  Christians  and  Muslim  money  to   Muslims  and  so  on.”   Sri  Lankan  High  Commissioner  Major  General  Janaka  Perera,  representing  the  Federation  of  Australian  Buddhist  Coun-  cils,  said:  ""We  will  monitor  how  the  distri-  bution  is  done  to  ensure  equality  because  the  destruction  and  the  pain  and  suffering  is  uniform  everywhere.”   Sri  Lankan-born  Dr  Amir  Ali,  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  president,  said  multi-faith  co-operation  involving  local  people  with  better  knowledge  of  the  distressed  areas  could  help  to  overcome  logistic  and  language  problems.  The  meet-  ing  to  launch  the  campaign  opened  with  a  Buddhist  prayer  intoned  by  Swami  Suresh  Battar,  of  the  Canberra  Hindu  Temple  and  Cultural  Centre.  Later,  the  meeting  heard  a  Christian  prayer  for  the  national  day  of  mourning,  January  16. ",2005-01-14
"  40TH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  HISTORIC  DOCUMENT   Pope  Benedict:  Nostra  Aetate  still  relevant   NEWS  AGENCIES   ROME  -  Pope  Benedict  XVI  urged  the  faithful  this  week  to  reread  key   Vatican  documents  on  Christian  education  and  relations  with  Jews  and  Muslims,  saying  the  teachings  were  of  “great  relevance”  today.   During  his  Sunday  blessing  in  St  Peter’s  Square,  Benedict  high  lighted  the  landmark  document  Nostra  Aetate  —  Latin  for  “In  our  time”  —  which  dealt  with  the  Catholic  Church’s  relations  with  Jews  and  members  of  other  reli  gions.   The  Vatican  staged  an  official   celebration  to  mark  the  40th  anniversary  of  the  document,  which  revolutionised  the  Vatican’s   relations  with  Jews  by  deploring  antisemitism  and  repudiating  the  “deicide”  charge  that  blamed  Jews  as  a  people  for  Christ’s  death.   At  the  ceremony  held  Thursday,  the  Pope  called  for  a  renewed  com  mitment  for  Catholics  and  Jews  to  deepen  their  bonds  and  work  for  the  good  of  all  humanity.   The  ceremony  was  not  devoid  of  controversy,  after  Rome’s  chief  rabbi,  Riccardo  Di  Segni,  refused   to  attend  the  ceremony  because  of  the  presence  of  one  of  the  keynote  speakers,  Cardinal  Jean-Marie  Lustiger,  a  Jewish  convert  to  Catholicism.   Rabbi  David  Rosen,  who  helped  negotiate  the  establishment  of  diplomatic  relations  between  the  Holy  See  and  Israel,  told  the  com  memoration  ceremony  that  Nostra  Aetate,  which  was  issued  following  the  Holocaust,  had  had  “truly  rev  olutionary”  implications.   “With  the  promulgation  of  this  declaration,  a  people  -  formerly   viewed  at  best  as  a  fossil  but  more  often  as  cursed  and  condemned  to  wander  and  suffer  —  was  now  offi   cially  portrayed  as  beloved  by  God  and  somehow  very  much  still  part  of  the  divine  plan  for  humankind,”   he  said.   But  he  said  both  Catholics  and   Jews  still  needed  to  fully  compre  hend  its  implications,  and  said  there  were  still  key  theological   issues  that  remain  to  be  worked  out  -  including  whether  the  Catholic  Church  will  relinquish   the  “invitation  to  conversion”  to  Christianity  of  the  Jews.

"  ?   Where  'Gay'  and  'God'  meet   'Gay'  and  'Christian'  are  sometimes  seen  as  two  camps,  two  extremes,  like  Liberal  and  Labor  or  opera  and  rock  music.  But  the  truth  is  exactly  the  opposite.  There  is  not  only  some  compatibility  but  Jesus'  message  is  particularly  for  Gay  people.  There  are  two  aspects  of  Christianity  which  we  want  to  talk  about:  One,  that  God's  message  is  for  those  on  the  margins  of  society,  for  whom  it  brings  hope,  value  and  community.  Two,  that  it  brings  an  alternative  way  of  living  to  what  is  often  promoted  today  in  that  it  rejects  a  life  of  selfish  consumerism  in  which  only  the  ego  and  its  material  wants  count.  In  this  way,  the  message  of  God  is  not  just  particularly  for  Gay  and  Lesbians  but  also  particularly  for  refugees,  ethnic  minorities,  and  anyone  else  who  society  sees  as  inferior.  And  also  for  all  those  who  see  the  destructive  way  many  of  us  live,  and  think  there  must  be  more  than  this.  In  writing  this,  I  want  to  particularly  reach  out  to  Gay  people  who  seek  hope,  but  I  want  also  to  touch  anyone  for  whom  these  two  aspects  are  particularly  relevant.  At  the  end  we  will  also  provide  a  more  detailed  look  at  what  God  says  on  the  subject  for  those  Christians  who  are  interested  in  the  issue  of  Sexuality  and  the  Bible.  So,  let's  unpack  these  two  claims.  Number  one,  that  the  message  Jesus  brings  is  particularly  for  those  on  the  margins.  Many  gay  people  feel  rejected  by  society,  often  rejected  by  friends  and  family.  They  feel  hurt  and  victims  of  a  world  that  looks  down  on  those  who  are  different.  Maybe  they  were  bullied  at  school,  maybe  they  don't  conform  to  some  social  ideal  of  rugbyplaying,  beer-drinking,  good-looking,  all-Australian  male.  Well  there's  good  news:  ""He  who  is  least  amongst  you  all  -  he  is  the  greatest""  (Luke  9:48).  Jesus  brings  a  message  of  hope  for  all  of  those  who  haven't  had  the  easy  life.  ""Blessed  are  those  who  mourn,  for  they  will  be  comforted.  Blessed  are  the  meek,  for  they  will  inherit  the  earth.  Blessed  are  those  who  hunger  and  thirst  for  righteousness,  for  they  will  be  filled.""  (Matthew  5:4-6).  Jesus  didn't  hang  out  with  the  rich  and  powerful  or  religious  leaders,  he  hung  out  with  those  on  the  margins  -  the  crazy,  the  poor,  the  prostitutes,  the  diseased  cripples.  People  whom  society  thought  of  as  worthless.  For  everyone  who's  been  insulted,  beaten  up,  or  simply  ignored  -  and  most,  if  not  all,  gay  people  have  experienced  this  at  some  point  -  there's  comfort,  there's  a  better  life  and  there's  a  sense  of  fulfilment  that  Jesus  promises  those  who  believe  in  him.  This  is  not  only  in  a  spiritual  sense  (which  is  important!),  but  in  an  earthly  sense,  as  part  of  the  Christian  community.  Jesus  talked  about  the  Kingdom  of  God.  This  doesn't  just  mean  up  in  heaven  or  at  some  future  point,  but  also  right  now,  in  our  churches,  in  our  community.  For  me  personally,  even  as  I've  been  hurt  and  rejected  by  my  parents,  my  Christian  friends  were  always  there  for  me  when  it  was  tough.  There's  always  a  place  for  Gay  and  Lesbian  people  within  church,  because  they  often  need  community  more  than  most.  Furthermore,  for  every  gay  and  lesbian  person  who  feels  rejected  and  judged  by  society  as  immoral  -  so  was  Jesus!  He  was  an  outcast  and  was  even  crucified  for  supposedly  breaking  religious  law.  He  said  that  ""If  the  world  hates  you,  keep  in  mind  that  it   hated  me  first.""  (John  15:18).  For  most  people,  'gay  culture'  is  Oxford  Street  and  Mardi  Gras.  People  have  an  idea  of  gay  culture  that  is  a  caricature  of  modern  society  -  based  around  trying  to  gratify  a  limitless  ego  with  buying  stuff  we  don't  need,  having  sex  with  people  we  don't  know  (or  even  like)  and  not  giving  a  crap  about  anyone  else  but  ourselves.  'Happiness'  now  comes  in  powder  form.  For  gay  people,  it's  almost  like  we  feel  that  the  world  has  said  f**k  you  to  us,  so  we're  gonna  say  f**k  you  right  back.  Some  people  have  been  so  hurt  they're  willing  to  believe  this,  but  in  reality  many  young  gay  and  lesbian  people  are  repelled  by  this  kind  of  lifestyle  (and  not  just  gay  people,  lots  of  people  hopefully  feel  that  life  isn't  all  about  selfishness).  People,  gay  and  straight,  know  there's  a  better  way  to  live.  This  is  the  second  place  that  'gay'  and  'God'  meet.  Jesus  provides  an  alternate  way  of  living  -  an  alternative  to  the  worst  excesses  of  modern  consumer  society  as  exemplified  in  much  'gay  culture'.  He  puts  it  straight:  ""This  is  my  command:  love  each  another""  (John  15:17).  It's  as  simple  and  hard  as  that.  He  calls  us  to  ""give  to  everyone  who  asks  you...love  your  enemies.  Lend  to  them  without  expecting  to  get  anything  back...be  merciful....do  not  judge...do  not  condemn""  (Luke  6:30-37).  Crazy  stuff.  But  by  trying  to  live  like  this,  being  part  of  the  church,  I've  gained  so  much.  Stuff  like  volunteering  at  a  local  homeless  shelter  I've  found  way  more  rewarding  that  spending  my  money  smoking  weed  or  buying  stuff  or  trying  to  pick  up  at  a  club  or  just  generally  being  a  selfish  bastard.  Life's  bigger  than  that.  And  I've  found  along  the  way  I'm  not  the  only  gay  person  trying  to  serve  others  -  it's  funny,  when  I  met  up  with  a  load  of  gay  Christians  nearly  everyone  of  them  was  trying  to  live  it  Jesus'  way  -  teaching,  working  in  charities  or  for  the  church,  or  just  trying  to  make  that  difference  somehow.  Building  the  kingdom  of  God.  One  brick  at  a  time.  Homosexuality  &amp;  Christianity:  A  story  of  two  shirts...  Can  t-shirts  be  political?  Around  uni  you  certainly  see  lots  of  people  branding  themselves  with  the  causes  they  believe  in  -  the  latest  Med  Revue  shirt  for  all  those  dedicated  Revue-ers  out  there,  or  t-shirts  that  say,  ""No  VSU"",  for  example.  It  seems  that  what  you  wear  can  say  a  lot  about  you,  and  it  can  be  pretty  scary  to  wear  a  shirt  that  tells  the  world  something  quite  personal  about  yourself!  This  is  a  story  of  me  and  two  of  my  t-shirts.  They  can  be  a  bit  scary  to  wear,  these  two  t-shirts.  The  first  has  a  picture  of  Jesus  breaking  a  gun,  alongside  the  previous  name  of  the  Christian  student  group  I'm  a  part  of  (now  called  Christian  Students  Uniting).  The  second  shirt  came  from  this  year's  Mardi  Gras.  On  the  front  it  says,  ""Same  sex  loving?""  and  on  the  back:  ""Repeal  the  ban:  Queer  marriage"".  It's  certainly  interesting  to  see  the  reactions  that  people  have  to  those  t-shirts.  A  few  weeks  ago  I  wore  the  Jesus  one  to  work  for  the  first  time,  and  my  (gay)  boss'  first  reaction  was,  ""Uniting  Church?  What  do  they  think  of  homosexuals?""  -  but  before  I  had  much  of  a  chance  to  answer  he  was  already  on  the  defensive,  expecting  to  be  told  he  was  going  to  hell.   Two  of  my  best  gay  mates  getting  married  last  week.  One  works  for  the  church  in  development  and  the  other  works  in  a  charity  supporting  battered  women.  I  learnt  a  lot  about  God  from  them   As  for  the  Mardi  Gras  one,  I  must  confess  I  haven't  worn  it  much  in  public  aside  from  the  actual  parade.  But  in  the  holidays  I  made  a  decision  to  take  it  out  from  the  back  of  my  drawer  and  stop  pretending  I'm  still  confused  about  my  sexuality!  Yes,  I've  decided  to  call  myself  lesbian  without  any  ""maybe,  or  I  guess  I  could  be  bi""  tacked  on  the  end.  And  I've  decided  to  tell  the  world  through  my  choice  of  t-shirt.  Now  you  might  be  wondering  what  my  Jesus  t-shirt  has  to  do  with  any  of  this,  and  I  guess  lots  of  people  would  assume  that  Christianity  and  homosexuality  are  incompatible;  certainly  you  might  think  that  the  last  place  I'd  wear  my  Mardi  Gras  shirt  would  be  to  church.  But  given  that  half  our  congregation  is  queer,  and  our  previous  minister  organised  a  Uniting  Church  float  a  few  years  back,  I  think  it  would  be  one  of  the  easiest  places  to  give  it  a  try.  Actually  I  firmly  believe  that  Christianity  isn't  just  compatible  with  homosexuality;  I  believe  that  Christians  should  be  more  than  ""tolerant""  of  lesbians  and  gay  men.  While  homosexuality  is  considered  ""abnormal""  by  much  of  society,  Christians  need  to  stand  with  queer  people  in  solidarity  when  they  are  marginalised.  Also,  we  should  celebrate  the  diverse  sexualities  that  are  in  our  churches  and  the  freedom  that  bein^  honest  about  our  sexuality  brings  to  our  lives!  Jesus  was  always  breaking  the  rules  of  his  society,  and  breaking  down  distinctions  between  good/bad  people  -just  like  our  society  still  creates  this  artificial  distinction  between  ""normal""  heterosexuality  and  ""abnormal""  homosexuality  (and  other  sexualities  are  generally  totally  off  the  radar).  It  was  exactly  this  kind  of  judgement  that  Jesus  wanted  to  free  us  from,  so  that  we  could  be  affirmed  as  we  are  and  be  united  across  boundaries.  ..  Cont.  on  Page  5   ...  Cont  from  Page  4...  There  are  some  amazing  examples  of  Jesus  refusing  to  buy  into  the  judgements  of  his  day.  He  stood  around  a  well  in  the  middle  of  the  day  talking  to  a  woman  who  had  a  dubious  sexual  history,  surprising  enough  because  of  the  gender  divisions  at  the  time,  but  also  because  he  didn't  care  what  people  might  think  about  his  own  character.  He  was  more  interested  in  actually  listening  to  the  woman  with  respect.  Stories  about  Jesus  healing  ""lepers""  are  not  just  about  individuals  becoming  healthy;  you  just  weren't  meant  to  go  near  that  kind  of  person  at  the  time.  In  particular  society's  rules  said  that  you  shouldn't  touch  them,  but  that's  just  what  Jesus  did  because  he  believed  that  it  was  particularly  important  to  be  with  anyone  society  might  marginalise  or  persecute.  The  other  reason  why  Christians  should  be  more  than  ""tolerant""  is  that  the  Christian  ""family""  is  made  up  of  all  different  types  of  people,  who  are  good  at  all  different  types  of  things,  and  who  come  from  all  sorts  of  perspectives.  All  Christians  have  different  experiences  which  help  them  to  understand  the  mystery  of  God;  so  we  should  celebrate  how  God  speaks  to  us  in  so  many  different  ways!  I  am  only  slowly  coming  to  see  myself  as  a  lesbian,  which  is  why  I've  only  been  brave  enough  to  wear  my  Mardi  Gras  t-shirt  a  couple  of  times.  In  getting  to  where  I  am  now,  I've  had  to  do  a  lot  of  thinking  about  who  I  am  and  what  that  means.  I  think  this  process  of  questioning  my  sexuality  and  starting  to  come  out  (especially  to  myself,  which  is  just  as  hard  as  coming  out  to  other  people)  has  allowed  me  to  understand  some  of  the  things  the  Bible  talks  about  that  I  never  understood  before.  Jesus  talks  about  concepts  of  freedom  and  living  life  to  the  full,  which  I  guess  is  connected  to  realising  that  you  don't  have  to  be  the  person  society  tells  you  to  be.  Society  itself  does  not  have  to  be  the  way  it  is  -  change  is  possible  on  all  levels.  I  feel  that  in  this  process  of  identifying  as  lesbian  I'm  becoming  free  and  really  living  in  a  way  that  I  never  knew  before!  I  never  felt  trapped,  but  now  every  time  I  say,  ""I  am  lesbian!""  I  feel  liberated  and  I  can't  stop  grinning.  I  know  that  God  is  the  source  of  my  being  and  my  life,  so  as  I  get  more  in  touch  with  that  source  I  am  able  to  get  more  in  touch  with  my  real  self.  So  that's  why  I've  decided  to  stop  shying  away  from  my  Mardi  Gras  t-shirt,  and  it's  also  why  I  wear  the  Jesus  t-shirt.  T-shirts  really  can  be  political,  and  telling  the  world  what  you  believe  in  or  something  about  yourself  can  be  confronting,  but  it's  great  to  feel  that  you  no  longer  have  anything  to  hide.

"  Finding  Nemo:  What  they  didn't  tell  you...   By  Clio  Gates  Foale   Amazingly  enough,  Disney  has  long  been  a  target  for  boycott  by  conservative  American  Christian  groups.

Clownfish,  the  aquarium  pet  of  choice  since  the  release  of  the  animated  movie,  live  in  such  a  rigid  social  structure  in  the  wild  that  if  one  of  the  dominant  breeding  adults  is  removed,  the  size,  status  and  even  sex  of  the  other  clownfish  change  rapidly  to  return  the  group  to  the  status  quo.  ""If  the  female  of  the  group  dies,  the  male  changes  sex  and  becomes  the  breeding  female,""  said  Cornell  University  evolutionary  biologist  Peter  Buston,  ""while  the  largest  non-breeder  becomes  the  breeding  male.""  The  world,  it  seems,  is  filled  with  examples  of  queerness  in  the  animal  kingdom.  Apparently  there  are  very  few  species  that  are  exclusively  heterosexual.  The  most  striking  example  of  queerness  is  that  of  Bonobo  apes  who  have  an  almost  insatiable  sexual  appetite  and  populations  have  been  found  to  be  100%  bisexual.  Galah  populations  have  shown  to  be  44%  homosexual  and  11%  bisexual,  Japanese  Macaques  9%  and  56%  respectively  and  Black-headed  Gulls  22%  and  15%  (Bahemihl,  2000).  During  their  'Warm  May'  festival,  Zurich  Zoo  offered  a  guided  tour  related  specifically  to  the  many  examples  of  homosexuality  in  the  animal  kingdom.  The  Bonobos  came  up  as  a  prime  example  of  sexual  exuberance,  and  Flipper  shall  never  be  the  same  again  now  that  you  know  that  gay  male  dolphins  use  their  partner's  blowhole  for  sexual  gratification.  In  Zurich  Zoo  itself  they  had  a  gay  flamingo  couple  ho  remained  partners  for  life,  and  a  lesbian  pen-   guin  couple  who  each  year  would  steal  their  neighbour's  egg  and  treat  it  as  their  own.  There  have  been  studies  on  this  topic  going  back  hundreds  of  years,  but  few  scientists  have  been  willing  to  explore  it  thoroughly  for  fear  of  being  labeled  gay  themselves.  However  in  1999  the  American  biologist  Bruce  Bagemihl's  study  ""Biological  Exuberance""  finally  documented  homosexual  activity  in  more  than  450  animal  species.  The  'It's  just  not  natural'  argument  against  homosexuality  has  been  a  common  one  from  religious  and  conservative  groups  for  many  years.  To  quote  one  example,  the  archbishop  of  Nigeria  said  recently,  ""Homosexuality  is  so  unnatural.  Even  in  the  world  of  dogs,  cows  and  lions  we  don't  hear  of  such  things.""  Since  evidence  to  the  contrary  has  arisen  they  have  had  to  come  up  with  some  theories  to  explain  the  phenomenon.  Arguments  follow  that  incidence  of  homosexuality  only  arises  when  populations  become  too  large,  or  when  it  is  a  harem-based  population  with  only  one  dominant  male  and  many  females.  However  no  evidence  has  been  put  forward  to  support  the  large  population  theory,  and  the  harem  theory  has  been  shot  down  by  dominant  silver-back  gorillas  who  have  frequently  been  seen  canoodling  with  each  other  while  available  females  get  the  cold  shoulder.  Interestingly  enough,  humans  appear  to  be  the  only  species  who  are  intolerant  towards  homosexuality.  Bagemihl  notes  that  homophobia  is  unheard  of  in  the  animal  kingdom  but  commonplace  in  the  human  world.  This  intolerance  is  not  entirely  restricted  to  human  queerness  either.  In  1999,  a  Florida  man  was  sentenced  to  six  months  in  prison  for  a  brutal  assault  on  the  family's  poodle-yorkie  cross.  His  owner  was  so  ashamed  of  the  ""unnatural  behaviour""  of  his  ""queer-type  dog""  that  he  beat  him  until  he  was  so  badly  injured  he  had  to  be  put  down.  The  dog  had  tried  to  mount  a  male  Jack  Russell  (Hankins,  J.  2003).  So  what  can  we  learn  from  all  of  this?  One  might  say  that  if  the  non-human  animals  can  follow  a  path   of  tolerance  and  understanding,  why  can't  we?  Nature  is  a  celebration  of  diversity.  We  should  appreciate  the  great  variety  of  people  and  animals  we  have  out  there  rather  than  embracing  only  monotony  and  the  familiar.  But  if  you  learned  nothing  from  this  article,  then  to  you  the  homophobe,  at  least  come  up  with  something  better  than  It's  just  not  natural'.  Bagemihl,B.  Ph.D  2000.

"  Jews  miss  out  in  study  of  religion  and  politics   BOOK  REVIEW   DEBORAH  STONE   GOD  UNDER  HOWARD   Marion  Maddox   Allen  and  Unwin,  $29.95   IT’S  an  indication  of  the  dominance   of  the  Christian  religious  right  that  a  book  on  religion  in  Australian  poli   tics  doesn’t  find  the  need  to  mention  Jews.   Author  and  academic  Marion  Maddox  charts  the  influence  of  reli   gion  under  the  Howard  Govern   ment  in  her  new  book  God  Under   Howard,  published  recently  by  Allen   and  Unwin.  The  cover  of  the  book  features  a  spoof  of  a  classic  Ameri  can  Puritan  portrait,  an  image  which  accurately  reflects  the  book’s  thesis  that  Prime  Minister  John  Howard’s  social  and  moral  hemisphere  is  com  fortably  that  of  the  religious  right.   Maddox  is  not  driven  by  the  usual  thesis  that  Howard’s  attitudes  are  merely  a  throwback  to  his  1950s  Methodist  upbringing.   She  considers  the  attitudes  of  the   current  government  to  be  much  more  conscious  and  clever  though  frequently  concealed.   Maddox  looks  at  issues  including  the  impact  of  the  Lyons  Family  Forum,  the  debate  over  Northern   Territory  euthanasia  legislation  and  the  republic  debate,  concluding  that  religion  remains  a  powerful  element  in  politics  under  Howard.   And  religion  means  Christian.  The  book  does  give  some  space  to  attitudes  to  the  Islamic  community  and  shows  the  subliminal  marginal  ising  of  non-Christian  religious   adherents  as  extremist  and  therefore  dangerous.   Jews  should  take  no  comfort  that  we  are  not  mentioned  in  this  regard.  Those  who  can  make  such  claims  about  one  minority  are  as  capable  of  making  it  about  another.   Deborah  Stone  is  the  AIN’S  literary  editor. ",2005-04-01
"  Outlook   A  friend  of  the  Jews   iT  is  ironic  that  many  Jews  viewed  with  apprehension  the  appointment   to  the  Holy  See  of  John  Paul  II  27  years  ago.  The  first  non-Italian  pope  in  more  than  four  centuries,  from  Poland  of  all  places,  raised  concerns  that  the  modest  progress  achieved  in  Jewish-Christian  relations  might   be  reversed.   In  hindsight,  of  course,  the  contrary  was  true.  It  was  the  fact  that  Karol  Jozef  Wojtyla  had  been  bom  in  the  village  of  Wadowice  near  Cracow  that  probably  shaped  his  attitudes  towards  Jews  more  than  anything  else.  As  a  first-hand  witness  to  the  prominence  of  Polish  Jewry  before  the  Holocaust,  and  to  its  annihilation  by  the  Nazis,  no  pope  had  ever  been  better  placed  to  appreciate  the  enormity  and  gravity  of  the  crimes  committed  against  the  Jews,  and  no  pope  had  ever  been  better  suited  to  reflect  on  the  pivotal  role  of  the  Catholic  Church  in  fomenting  the  hatred  that  bred  antisemitism,  and  ultimately,  the  Nazi’s  genocide.   Perhaps  this  is  why  John  Paul’s  drive  for  atonement,  for  teshuva,  and  for  re-establishing  a  dialogue  between  the  Catholic  Church  and  the  Jews  was  truly  breathtaking.  As  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  noted  this  week:  “More  change  for  the  better  took  place  in  his  27-year  papacy  than  in  nearly  2000  years  before.”   Building  on  the  landmark  1965  Nostra  Aetate,  initiated  by  Pope  John  XXIII,  which  condemned  antisemitism  and  exonerated  Jews  for  any  “collec  tive  guilt”  for  the  crucifixion  of  Jesus,  John  Paul  II  expanded  and  deepened  the  reconciliation  between  Catholics  and  Jews.  He  was  the  author  of  count  less  “firsts”:  the  first  pope  to  visit  a  synagogue,  the  first  to  order  Carmelite  nuns  out  of  Auschwitz,  the  first  to  establish  diplomatic  ties  with  Israel,  the  first  to  visit  the  Western  Wall,  the  first  to  pay  homage  at  Yad  Vashem.   But  he  was  not  a  “perfect”  pope,  at  least  as  far  as  Jews  were  concerned.  At  times  he  was  accused  of  trying  to  “Christianise”  the  Shoah,  referring  to  Auschwitz  as  the  “Golgotha  of  the  modern  world”.  In  addition,  Jews  object  ed  to  his  canonisation  of  Father  Maximillian  Kolbe,  a  Polish  Catholic  priest  who  had  opposed  the  Nazis  but  who  was  also  the  founder  of  a  viciously  anti  semitic  newspaper  in  prewar  Poland,  and  they  were  disturbed  by  the  saint  hood  bestowed  on  Edith  Stein,  a  German  Jewish  intellectual  who  converted  to  Catholicism  and  became  a  nun  but  was  nonetheless  consigned  by  the  Nazis  as  a  Jew  to  die  at  Auschwitz.   John  Paul’s  refusal  to  criticise  his  predecessor,  Pius  XII,  for  his  silence  dur  ing  the  Holocaust,  and  indeed  the  continuing  Vatican  efforts  to  have  Pius  canonised,  also  rankled  many  Jewish  sensitivities.  Moreover,  the  Vatican’s  attitudes  towards  the  Palestinians  were  also  a  source  of  tension.  Many  Jews  felt  that  the  pope  did  not  do  enough  to  distance  the  Vatican  from  Yasser   Arafat  and  Palestinian  terrorism.   NONETHELESS,  despite  these  shortcomings,  in  the  long  and  troubled   history  of  Catholic-Jewish  relations,  John  Paul  II  stands  out  as  a  truly  bright  star  in  a  dark  sky.  From  the  days  of  the  Crusades  and  the  Inqui  sition,  from  the  expulsion  of  Jews  by  Pope  Leo  VII  in  the  10th  century  to  the  edict  of  Pope  Innocent  III  requiring  them  to  wear  yellow  badges  in  the  13th,  between  those  popes  who  invented  the  ghettoes  to  those  who  burned  Jewish  books  and  banned  the  Talmud,  from  the  early  religious  persecution  of  “non  believers”  to  the  prominent  role  of  the  Catholic  Church  in  the  fomentation  of  modem  antisemitism  —  against  all  these,  John  Paul  II  stood  out  as  a  bea  con  of  understanding,  compassion  and  dignity.  Two  millennia  of  Jew-hatred  cannot  be  erased  by  just  one  pope,  but  this  pope  arguably  did  more  than  any  one  human  can  be  expected  to  do.   As  Catholic  author  James  Carroll  wrote  in  his  book,  Constantine's  Sword,  by  going  to  the  Western  Wall,  by  shuffling  up  to  it  as  a  Jew  might,  by  insert  ing  a  piece  of  paper  into  its  cracks,  “the  church  was  honouring  the  Temple  it  had  denigrated.  It  was  affirming  the  presence  of  the  Jewish  people  at  home  in  Jerusalem.  It  was  reversing  an  ancient  current  Jew-hatred  with  that  act,  and  the  church’s  relationship  to  Israel,  present  as  well  as  past,  would  never  be   the  same.”   Perhaps  for  the  first  time  in  our  history,  we  Jews  will  truly  mourn  the  passing  of  the  Vicar  of  Christ  and  the  Bishop  of  Rome.  We  pray  that  John  Paul  II’s  successor  will  inherit  his  wisdom  and  fortitude  as  well,  so  that  he  may  walk  in  his  pioneering  footsteps. ",2005-04-08

"  Arts&amp;Books   Disquiet  over  Narnia's  religious  themes   JOE  ESKENAZI   SAN  FRANCISCO  -  The  $250-mil  lion  film  The  Chronicles  of  Narnia:  The  Lion,  the  Witch  and  the  Wardrobe  is  shaping  up  as  a  potential  block   buster.   Financed  by  a  fervent  Christian  and  bursting  with  Christian  over  tones,  it  is  causing  some  unease  among  the  Jewish  community.   The  special-effects-laden  adapta   tion  of  British  author  C  S  Lewis’  clas   sic  1950s  childrens  book  opened  last  week  in  the  United  States  and  Britain,  and  will  be  released  in  Australia  on  December  26.   It  was  produced  by  the  owner  of  the  San  Francisco  Examiner,  the  evan  gelical  billionaire  Philip  Anschutz,   who  also  owns  Walden  Media.   Some  Jews  have  expressed  reserva  tions  about  the  film.  Rabbi  Judah  Dardik  was  hooked  on  Lion  when  he   read  it  years  ago  as  a  student.   It  was  only  years  later  that  he  was  told  it  was  steeped  in  Christian  alle  gories.  He  was  “surprised  and  embar  rassed”  that  he  hadn’t  realised  and  felt  “duped”.   Rereading  the  series,  Rabbi  Dardik  saw  more  and  more  allegories  and  could  never  appreciate  the  books  as  mere  fiction  again.  Now  he  sees  them  as  beautifully-written  theology.   “Should  Jewish  children  see  this  movie  or  read  the  books?  I’m  unsure.  My  personal  jury  is  still  out,”  said  Rabbi  Dardik,  the  spiritual  leader  of  Beth  Jacob  Congregation  in  Oakland,   California.   “I  haven’t  seen  the  movie,  but  I  wouldn’t  be  surprised  if  they  fleshed  out  the  Christianity  a  bit  more  to  be  satisfying  to  the  Christian  audience.  That’s  the  part  that’s  most  disconcert  ing  to  me.”   Peter  Sealey,  a  marketing  professor  at  the  University  of  California  Berke  ley’s  Haas  School  of  Business,  and  the   former  president  of  marketing  and  distribution  for  Columbia  Pictures,  said  there  was  “duplicity”  in  the  way  Disney  is  shying  away  from  mention  ing  Lewis’  Christian  message  when  promoting  the  film  to  the  public.   “Disney  should  make  a  statement,  they  should  let  people  know.  The  lion  is  resurrected  ...  It’s  a  great  piece  of  entertainment  and  you  can  enjoy  it  if  you’re  Christian  or  not.  However,  the  underpinnings  of  the  work  reflect  the   New  Testament.”   Once  people  realise  that  Lewis  was  a  theologian  who  wrote  with  a  Chris  tian  message  in  mind,  the  parallels   between  the  Narnia  tales  and  the  New   Testament  easily  fall  into  place.   For  example,  the  child  Edmund  betrays  his  siblings  and  Aslan,  Judas  style,  to  aid  the  White  Witch,  and  is   saved  when  Aslan  allows  himself  to  be  sacrificed,  not  unlike  Jesus.   Pastor  Earl  Palmer,  co-founder  of  Berkeley’s  New  College  and  a  scholar   The  evil  white  witch  iadis  (Tilda  Swinton)  and  Edmund  (Skandar  Keynes)  in  The  Chronicles  of  Narnia:  The  Lion,  the  Witch  and  the  Wardrobe...  Christian  themes  have  raised  questions  among  Jews.   on  Lewis,  said  that  Aslan  is  a  loosely  veiled  Christ  figure,  but  says  Lewis  wasn’t  trying  to  fool  anyone.   “Before  turning  to  children’s  books,  he  wrote  Christian  religious   tracts.”   He  said  that  Lewis  denied  he  was   writing  allegorically.  Instead,  he   claimed  to  simply  be  imagining  the  concepts  of  good,  evil  and  the  ulti  mate  redeemer  in  a  mystical  world  of   his  own  creation.   The  movie  opened  last  week  in  the  United  States  and  Britain  and  will  screen   from  December  26  in  Australia. ",2005-12-16

Christian  faiths  include  Anglican,  Catholic,  Uniting  Church  and  Quakers.  Also  in  attendance  were  representatives  of  the  Armenian,  Greek  Orthodox  and  Coptic  Churches.   Lacey  said:  ^Our  challenge  is  for  members  to  be  confident  in  their  own  faiths,  and  rejoice  and  celebrate  our  dif   ferences.   “WIN  is  multi-cultural  as  well  as  inter-religious,  including  most  ethnic  groups.  Most  of  our  members  are  prominent  women  within  their  own  faith.   “Our  aim  is  to  encourage  mutual  understanding  and  learning  about  the  ideals  of  various  religious  groups,  through  personal  relationships  of  co  operation  and  discussion.

"  Revolutionary  approach  to  Christianity   BOOK  REVIEW   RAYMOND  APPLE   FOR  THE  SAKE  OF  HEAVEN  AND  EARTH:  THE  NEW  ENCOUNTER  BETWEEN  JUDAISM  AND  CHRISTIANITY  Irving  Greenberg   Jewish  Publication  Society  of  America,  $35   IRVING  (Yitz)  Greenberg  is  an   Orthodox  rabbi  with  whom  most   other  Orthodox  rabbis  disagree.   But  whether  you  are  on  Rabbi  Greenberg’s  side  or  not,  you  cannot  fail  to  notice  him  and  you  cannot  ignore  his  books  or  lectures.   When  he  visited  Australia  some  years  ago,  he  listened  to  my  criticism  of  his  pluralism  doctrine,  but  would  not  give  way  -  his  whole  life  was  staked  on  his  unconventional  ideas.   The  same  is  true  of  his  philosophy  of  Christian-Jewish  dialogue  which  is  the  theme  of  his  book  For  the  Sake  of   Heaven  and  Earth.   It  is  the  story  of  decades  of  inter  weaving  the  Jewish  and  Christian   worlds.  In  a  sense,  it  is  an  inter-reli  gious  autobiography,  charting  the  way  his  thinking  about  everything  is  coloured  by  the  Shoah  and  the  subse  quent  changes  in  Christian  thinking.   He  begins  with  the  words:  “Aware  ness  of  the  extraordinary  Christian  efforts  at  self-purification  vis-a-vis  Judaism  after  the  Holocaust  and  encounter  with  the  religious  power  and  ethical  contributions  of  Chris   tianity  have  evoked  in  me  the  recog  nition  that  Christians  seek  to  worship  the  same  God  and  to  perfect  the  same  world  that  the  Jews  do.”   |  He  would  put  on  his   j  tefillin,  but  was  unable   |  to  read  the  words  of  the  |  Siddur  because  of  the   |  sights  and  sounds  of  the   I  Holocaust.   The  story  does  not  begin  with  Greenberg’s  childhood,  but  with  the  year  1961  when,  he  writes:  “All  my  religious  positions  blew  up  in  the  course  of  an  explosive  confrontation  with  the  Holocaust.”  He  was  in  Israel  and  it  was  the  time  of  the  trial  of  Nazi  Adolf  Eichmann.   Caught  up  in  a  reading  frenzy  about  the  Holocaust,  he  was  over  taken  with  a  consuming  feeling  of  desolation.  He  would  put  on  his  tefillin,  but  was  unable  to  read  the  words  of  the  Siddur  because  of  the  sights  and  sounds  of  the  Holocaust   Yet  the  streets  of  Jerusalem,  teem  ing  with  life,  were  a  stunning,  almost  surreal  contradiction  to  the  death   that  reigned  at  Yad  Vashem.  Only  when  he  got  home  to  his  wife  and  child  did  the  despair  fade  into  joy.   Rabbi  Greenberg  was  furious  at   Rabbi  Irving  Greenberg...  unconventional  Ideas.   Christianity,  but  then  he  became  involved  in  discussions  with  Chris   tians  and  found  them  ready  to  listen   and  to  affirm  the  same  commitment  to  a  new  world  which  he  knew  in  Judaism.   His  resultant  essays  and  lectures  provoked  angry  opposition  from  Orthodox  authorities,  including  his  own  mentor,  Rav  Soloveitchik.   Unrepentant,  Rabbi  Greenberg  continued  to  acknowledge  a  new  type   of  encounter  between  the  two  faiths.   He  adapted  Christian  terminology  to  a  Jewish  context;  he  saw  the  Holo   caust  and  Israel  as  Judaism’s  events  of  crucifixion  and  resurrection.   Creating  Clal,  an  organisation  dedicated  to  Jewish  pluralism,  he  developed  a  pluralistic  model  for  inter-religious  dialogue;  he  saw  truths  in  all  religions  and  argued  that  truths  are  partial.   “It  should  now  be  the  prayer  of  believers  that  one’s  own  group  not  be  the  only  religion,”  he  wrote.  Result?  A  theology  that  is  quite  revolutionary.   Raymond  Apple  is  emeritus  rabbi  of  the   Great  Synagogue,  Sydney. ",2005-12-16
"  New  structure  set  to  secure  assets   By  Graham  Davis   A  new  multi-agency  com  mand  responsible  for  coordinat  ing  the  protection  of  Australia's  offshore  assets  including  oil   and  gas  platforms,  will  be  for  mally  launched  soon.  Called  the  Joint  Offshore  Protection  Command,  the  group  will  initially  comprise  Customs  and  the  ADF.  Its  principal  assets  assigned  to  do  its  daily  business  will  be  the  eight  Bay  Class  Customs  patrol  boats,  the  RAN's.  Fremantle  Class  patrol'  boats,  (to  .  be  replaced  by  the  Armidales)  and  Coastwatch  aircraft.  However,  should  a  more  seri-  .  ous  threat  be  detected  or  terrorist  incident  occur,  the  command  can  seamlessly  call  in  additional  resources  such  as  larger  RAN  warships,  the  RAAF  with  its  Orions  and  specialists  from  the  -Army.  The  Prime  Minister  first  told  of  the  new  command  in  December,  2004.  ""The  Joint  Command  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementa  tion,  coordination,  and  manage  ment  of  off-shore  maritime  secu  rity,""  Mr  Howard  said.  ""This  new  single  command  will  link  the  Defence  Force  responsibility  with  that  undertak-   en  by  the  Coastwatch  Division  of  the  Australian  Customs  Service.  ""The  command  will  have  a  joint  accountability  structure  being  responsible  to  the  Chief  of  the  Defence  Force  for  its  mili  tary  functions  and  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Customs  for  its  civil  functions.  ""The  Director  General  of  Coastwatch,  RADM  Russ  Crane  will  be  the  inaugural  Commander  of  the/command.  (He  will  have  a  dual  role  as  Director  General  Coastwatch).  ""Additional  funding  of  $5.6  million  over  four  years  will  be   allocated  for  the  establishment  of  the  joint  command,""  the  Prime  Minister  said.  Since  the  December  announcement  the  extensive  work  has  been  done  to  set  up  the  .command.  RADM  Crane  has  seconded  very  experienced  RAN  naval  officer  CAPT  Gerry  Christian  as  his  Chief  of  Staff.  CAPT  Christian  was  previ  ously  the  ADF  member  on  the  Taskforce  on  Offshore  Maritime  Security  at  the  Department  of  Prime  Minister  and  Cabinet.  .  ""Some  members  of  the  new.  command  will  operate  from  Custom's  National  Surveillance  Centre  in  Canberra,""  CAPT  Christian  told  Navy  News.  ""The  centre  is  manned  24  hours  a  day,""  He  said  the  new  command  could  not  be  regarded  as  a  Coastguard.  ""Australia  already  has   AMSA's  Rescue  Coordination  Centre.  ""It  is  focussed  on  providing  search  and  rescue  services  and  is  doing  an  excellent  job  ""AMSA's  search  and  rescue  role  remains  unaffected  by  this  change..  ""Our  new  command  is  cen  tred  on  providing  protection  to  offshore  assets  particularly  against  threats  from  terrorists,  not  search  and  rescue,""  CAPT  Christian  said.  The  Prime  Minister,  in  his  December  announcement,  said  the  Australian  Government  would  assume  direct  responsibil-  v  ity  for  counter-terrorism  preven  tion,  interdiction  and  response  in  all  offshore  areas  of  Australia.  This  approach  will  allow  the  States  and  the  Northern  Territory  to.  focus  on  their  clear  responsi  bility  for  initial  counter-terrorism  incident  response  and  security  arrangements  within  ports.  ""I  am  writing  to  the  premiers  and  to  the  Chief  Minister  of  .  the  Northern;  Territory  to  explain  these  revised  counter-terrorism  arrangements,""  Mr  Howard  said.

"  Irwin  blasts  Exodus  as   ‘old-fashioned  violence’   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   LABOR  backbencher  Julia  Irwin  this  week  described  the  biblical  story  of  the  Exodus  as  an  example  of  “good  old-fashioned  violence”  in  a  speech  defending  Muslims  against  “destructive  whisper  cam  paigns”.   In  Federal  Parliament,  she  attacked  the  use  by  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  and  others  of  the  term  Muslim  “fundamentalist”   when,  she  said,  they  really  meant   “violent  extremists”.   “But  when  it  comes  to  good  old  fashioned  violence,  the  Judeo  Christian  God  is  hard  to  beat.”   Irwin  then  catalogued  what  she  saw  as  the  violence  depicted  in  Exo  dus:  the  plagues,  the  slaughter  of  the  first-bom  and  the  looting  of  the  homes  of  the  Egyptian  families  mourning  their  dead.   “If  I  were  to  take  those  verses  as   written,  I  could  easily  associate  any  Christian  fundamentalist  with  a  dangerous  and  extreme  mindset,”   Irwin  said.   “But  we  are  more  likely  to  asso   ciate  the  term  ‘Christian  funda   mentalist’  with  psalm  singers  and  happy  clappers.”   Irwin  said  the  Anglican  Arch  bishop  of  Sydney,  Dr  Peter  Jensen,  in  a  recent  Boyer  lecture,  had  urged  the  adoption  of  the  biblical  history   of  Israel  “as  if  it  were  our  own”.   “But,”  she  said,  “unless  they  are   values  that  have  been  rendered  safe  for  human  consumption  and  purged  of  all  hypocrisy,  they  will  do  little  to  promote  tolerance  and  har  mony  and  even  less  to  promote  the  integration  of  the  followers  of  a  peaceful  [Muslim]  religion.”   Australia/Israel  8c  Jewish  Affairs  Council  executive  director  Dr  Colin  Rubenstein  said:  “Irwin’s   ignorance  is  compounded  by  her  arrogance.  Rather  then  analyse  Islamist  terrorism,  she  has  chosen  to  slander  Judaism  and  Christiani  ty.  Her  apologetics  and  blame  shift  ing  ignores  a  reality  in  which  Islamist  jihadists  wage  a  no-holds   barred  terrorist  war.   “Just  as  it  is  wrong  to  tar  the  peace-abiding  Muslim  majority  with  the  terrorist  brush,  we  must  never  allow  politically-correct  indulgence  of  the  sort  practiced  by  Julia  Irwin  to  blind  us  to  this  gen  uine  threat,  a  threat  shared  by  Christians,  Jews  and  Muslims,”  Dr  Rubenstein  said.

"  IRWIN’S  IDIOCY   IF  there  was  ever  any  doubt  before,  Julia  Irwin  has  now  well  and  truly  confirmed  that  she  has  completely  lost  the  plot   To  compare  the  Bible  (or  Old  Testa  ment)  with  Islamic  fundamentalists,  whose  sole  goal  it  is  to  kill,  murder,  maim  and  terrorise  as  many  innocent  civilians  in  the  name  of  God  as  possi  ble,  with  so  called  “Judeo-Christian  fundamentalists”,  who  at  worst  may  espouse  some  “extreme”  views,  yet  do  so  within  a  largely  peaceful  and  demo   cratic  framework,  without  resorting  to  such  violence  and  terror,  is  morally  repugnant,  blatantly  ignorant  and  totally  inexcusable.   One  must  also  consider  the  vastly  different  ways  in  which  both  commu  nities  treat  such  extremists  and  funda  mentalists  -  the  “Judeo-Christian”  communities  rightfully  condemn  such  action,  while  endeavouring  to  take  appropriate  judicial  redress.  Although  the  vast  peace-loving  bulk  of  the  Islamic  community  take  a  similar  view,  a  significant  portion  still  lauds,  encourages  or  turns  a  blind  eye  to  such   action.   Irwin  should  be  ashamed  of  herself.   She  has  a  real  warped  sense  of  reality.  It  is  about  time  Kim  Beazley  reprimand  ed  her  accordingly,  beyond  his  stan   dard  rebuke.

"  D  I  Y  Identity   By  Rachael  Kendrick   Now  that  you've  left  the  compulsory  mediocrity  of  high  school  it's  time  to  explore.  Screw  studying  and  earning  a  degree;  university  is  about  finding  out  who  you  are.  It's  about  exploring  yourself:  reaching  deep  inside  and  figuring  out  what  the  world  has  to  give  to  you  and  what  you  have  to  give  to  the  world.  When  you're  done  with  that,  you  can  arbitrarily  choose  a  pre-digested  category  to  cram  yourself  into.  After  all,  everything  looks  good  when   you're  young  and  living  off  mummy  and  daddy's  dollars.  If  not,  you're  probably  a  mature  age  student  and  well  out  of  our  target  demographic.  Go  busy  yourself  reading  the  Public  Service  Gazette  or  raising  your  children,  this  doesn't  concern  you.   The  question  is,  which  ideology  will  you  look  best  in?  Do  you  have  the  righteous  panache  to  pull  off  a  Che  Guevara  shirt  and  a  healthy,  socialist  outlook?  Are  you  enthusiastic  and  ambiguous  enough  to  be  queer?  Are  you  hardcore  enough  to  be  straight  edge?  Join  us  for  a  journey  through  the  fecund  garden  of  university  ideology.  Socialist  'Most  untidy  people  are  Socialists,'  says  my  blouse  wearing,  pinko,  informant  James,  21,  'but  not  all  Socialists  are  untidy.'  If  you  lurk  around  the  Moran  building  or  Calypso  long  enough,  you're  likely  to  run  into  these  Green  Left-reading  pirates  of  the  political  landscape.  Fond  of  words  like  'action,'  'collective,'  and  'non-hierarchical  anti-bourgeois  leadership  structure,'  especially  when  used  in  a  snappy  political  chant,  Socialists  are,  like,  so  hot  right  now.  They  spend  their  time  with  Left  Labor  battling  evil  HECS  through  poster  runs.  You'll  find  the  campus  Socialist  sporting  a  wide  array  of  politically  aware  chic,  from  no-sweat  sneakers  to  home  stencilled  shirts  bearing  clever  puns  on  the  name  of  George  W.  Bush.  Young  Laboral  For  brevity's  sake,  given  the  many  qualities  shared  by  the  middle-of-the-road  Young  Labor  and  Young  Liberals,  we'll  refer  to  them  as  one  entity  -  the  Young  Laboral.  You'll  find  the  Young  Laboral  plotting  in  the  uni  bar,  reading  anything  from  The  Economist  to  The  Financial  Review,  and  dreaming  of  ways  to  better  the  world  through  economic  rationalism.  You'll  find  a  Young  Laboral  in  a  vest,  tie,  or  rugby  shirt  with  the  collar  turned  up,  scurrying  off  to  their  work  experience  gig  in  some  impressive-sounding  sector  of  the  public  service.  Often  accused  of  being  careerist,  the  Young  Laboral  doesn't  really  mind  money.  Unlike  the  Socialist,  they  don't  have  calluses  from  handling  butcher's  paper  and  hand  written  nametags.  They  prefer  Bill  Gates  to  the  Socialists'  Che  Guevara.  Hated  from  all  sides,  there's  something  endearing  about  the  Young  Laboral's  80s-James-Spader-ishness.  Christian  In  these  hedonistic  times,  what  could  be  cooler  than  going  old  school?  Like,  2000  years  old  school.  Y'see,  there  was  once  this  whacked-out  guy  with  long  hair  and  a  lot  of  crazy  ideas,  and,  like  modern  Christians,  people  didn't  always  like  what  he  was  saying  or  wearing  or  doing.  Christians  today,  however,  don't  have  to  worry  about  being  crucified  or  eaten  by  lions.  Today  we  have  Christian  TV,  Christian  music  festivals,  Christian  clothing,   Christian  magazines  and  Hillsong.  What  better  time  to  declare  to  the  world  that  Jesus  is  just  all  right  with  you,  and  what  better  place  to  do  it  than  at  university,  where  good,  old-fashioned  Christian  morals  meets  bland  youthful  trendiness?  My  right-on  buddy,  Easty,  21,  tells  me  that  you  can  pick  a  Christian  out  of  the  crowd  by  their  conservative-trendy  clothes  and  focus  t-shirts,  wide-eyed  optimism  and  belief  in  the  worth  of  man.  He  also  tells  me  that  Christians  don't  like  sunlight  or  Supre,  but  that  may  not  be  entirely  accurate.  Sports  Rep  ^  Despite  how  much  we  underpantsy,  limp  wristed  /  1  dorkataurs  might  profess  to  hate  our  RE  teachers,  there's  1  something  beguiling  about  a  person  with  really  good  ,'  hand-eye  coordination  and  a  whistle.  Swaggering  about  in  shorts,  strapping  tape  and  rugby  jerseys  with  the  collar  turned  up,  this  Australian  version  of  the  college  jock  is  pure  sex  on  Colorado  sandals.  The  best  thing  is,  they  don't  even  realise  it.  Knuckleheaded  in  that  gormless,  earnest-to-a-fault  kind  of  way,  they're  often  rather  smart  and  do  better  than  you  in  exams  without  as  much  wailing  and  gnashing  of  teeth.  The  sports  rep  wakes  up  in  time  for  5am  training  sessions,  doesn't  mind  sweat  and  violence,  and  often  sports  that  frosted  fashion  mullet  with  aplomb.  Anyway,  let's  face  it,  they  probably  look  far  hotter  than  your  pasty,  squashily  unexercised  self.  Queer  In  a  time  when  our  television  screens  are  filled  with  people  of  the  same  gender  doin'  each  other  like  bunnies,  or  at  least  camping  around  and  being  funny  a  la  Queer  Eye  for  the  Straight  Guy,  you'd  expect  queers  on  campus  to  be  out  there,  in  your  face,  flyin'  their  freak  flag  high.  In  reality,  most  campus  queers  remain  gallingly  low  key,  going  to  their  classes,  fretting  about  homework,  getting  drunk  and  getting  laid  just  like  the  straight  kids.  While  it  would  be  nice  to  think  you  could  pick  a  Gaylord  just  by  looking  at  him/her/none  of  the  above,  it's  really  not  the  case.  Yes,  gay  boys  do  like  their  cock  and  tight  t-shirts,  and  your  standard  dyke  probably  does  play  more  team  sports  and  have  very  short  hair,  but  I've  probably  just  described  90%  of  the  people  in  Mooseheads.  The  best  place  to  find  campus  queers  is,  well,  off  campus,  in  stereotypical  gay  haunts  like  Tilley's  and  Cube.  Straight  edge  In  the  words  of  seminal  hardcore  act  Minor  Threat,  'while  a  straight  edge  kid  might  not  smoke,  drink  or  fuck,  at  least  they  can  fuckin'  think.'  Moreover,  they  have  some  pretty  fuckin'  cool  haircuts  and  body  art  -  fuckin'.  Being  straight  edge  is  about  rejecting  the  idea  that  you  need  to  fuck  your  head  up  with  substances  to  be  cool.  Straight  edge  kids  avoid  addiction  in  all  forms,  be  it  to  drugs,  alcohol  or  sex.  Straight  edge  is  often  associated  with  the  hardcore  music  scene,  and  with  looking  and  acting  a  particular  way.  As  such  it's  become  fashionable,  the  kind  of  in-crowd  Minor  Threat  was  criticising  in  the  first  place.  Still,  as  Chris,  21  ,  says  'it's  not  about  having  Xes  on  your  hands,  its  about  being  honest  with  yourself.'  But  if  you  want  a  bit  of  straight  edge  cred,  tattooing  some  Xes  onto  yourself  and  eschewing  the  crowd  at  the  bar  for  a  bottle  of  water  and  good,  old  fashioned  thrashing  on  the  dance  floor  won't  go  astray.   So,  what  are  you?  All  this  plurality  is  well  and  good,  but  you're  still  left  with  the  question  -  which  university  stereotype  am  I?  In  the  interest  of  streamlining  this  process,  we've  developed  this  quiz  to  help  you  squeeze  your  square  peg  into  whichever  shape  of  hole  you  find  most  appealing.  1.

Your  idea  of  hell  is:  a)  A  big,  sticky-floored  bar  playing  Destiny's  Child  b)  A  meeting  of  'Save  the  Ridge.'  c)  Dinner  with  folks  from  the  Department  of  Finance.  d)  A  24-hour  couch-bound  Buffy  marathon  with  Doritos  and  cupcakes.  e)  Being  forced  to  listen  to  John  Laws.  f)  Eternal  damnation.  Well,  that's  kind  of  what  hell  is,  isn't  it?

"  Mandarin   spelling  of‘Jew’  challenged   U&amp;N  BLOOM   TAIPEI,  Taiwan  -  The  Chinese  lan  guage  comprises  thousands  of  char  acters  and  combinations  of   characters,  each  composed  of  various  strokes.  Now  a  human-rights  group  in  Taiwan  is  calling  on  Chinese  jour  nalists  and  academics  around  the   world  to  stop  the  “discriminatory”  way  that  the  characters  for  “Jewish  people”  are  written  in  Mandarin.   ‘The  combination  that  is   currently  being  used   refers  to  an  animal  of  the  monkey  species.”   CHIEN  HIS-CHIEH  Director,  Peacetime  Foundation  of  Taiwan   “There  are  many  Chinese  charac  ters  for  You-tai,  or  Jew,  but  the  com  bination  that  is  currently  being  used  refers  to  an  animal  of  the  monkey  species  and  has  the  connotation  of  stinginess,”  Chien  Hsi-chieh,  the  director  of  the  Peacetime  Foundation  of  Taiwan,  said.   Chien’s  remarks  at  a  news  confer  ence  in  Taipei,  complete  with  illustra  tions  of  the  offending  characters  and  the  new  characters  he  recommends,  were  widely  reported  in  Chinese-lan  guage  media  across  Taiwan  and  ^Shina.   Chien  said  the  biased  Chinese   characters  were  devised  by  Christian  missionaries  in  China  around  1830,  when  they  were  translating  the   Hebrew  and  Christian  Bibles  into  -^jihinese  and  needed  a  term  for  “Jews”.   Since  Taiwan  has  no  official  diplo  matic  ties  with  Israel  due  to  the  Jew  ish  state’s  “one  China”  policy,  there  have  been  no  contacts  with  Jerusalem  about  the  matter,  Chien  said,  but  he  atided  that  he  has  spoken  with  repre   sentatives  of  the  Israeli  trade  office  in   Taipei  on  several  occasions.

"  THE  JEWISH  WEEK  IN   1975  (FEBRUARY  21)   •  Australian  Keren  Hayesod-United  Israel  Appeal  president  Isador  Magid  returns  from  a  six-week  tour  of  Israel  during  which  he  attended  the  first  international  seminar  on  Soviet  Jewry  and  was  Australia’s  representative  on  the  Prime  Minister's  Study  Mission.  The  seminar  included  reports  from  Israeli  officials  on  the  problems  of  immigration  and  absorption  of  Soviet  Jews;   •  Issuing  a  statement  in  Sydney,  the  Federation  of  Jewish  Welfare  Societies  calls  on  local  communities  in  all  states  to   assist  with  the  integration  of  Soviet  Jewish  arrivals  in  Australia.  About  160  Russian  Jewish  immigrants  arrived  in  1974  and  although  numbers  have  been  limited  by  the  present  admission  policy  of  the  Australian  government,  it  is  expected  that  further  migrants  will  arrive  as  part  of  the  family  reunion  scheme.  Australian  Jewish  Welfare  Society  president  Dr  Sydney  Einfeld,  also  a  member  of  the  NSW  Parliament,  recently  returned  from  a  seven-week  fact-finding  trip  on  Soviet  immigration,  visiting  Israel,  Switzerland,  Australia  and  the  US;   •  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Nathan  Jacobson  chairs  a  plenary  session  of  the  sixth  assembly  of  the  World  Jewish  Congress  in  Jerusalem;   •  The  West  German  Bundestag  (Parliament)  ratifies  a  1971  French  German  convention  allowing  the  prosecution  of  German  war  criminals  who  were  sentenced  in  their  absence  by  French  courts  after  World  War  II.

"  TASTELESS   I  WISH  to  comment  on  the  Star  ot  David  version  of  hot-cross  buns  which  were  depicted  as  coming  from  Istvans  Bakery,  and  Kron’s  cartoon  which  showed  someone  carrying  a  cross  and  two  rabbis  saying  “either  it’s  Good  Friday  or  that’s  a  highly  inap  propriate  Purim  costume”  (AJN  25/3).   I  think  the  buns  are  inappropriate  and  ridicule  a  Christian  tradition,  even  if  it  is  a  somewhat  commer  cialised  one.  I  do  not  think  it  was   right  to  make  them  with  a  Star  of   David.   Regarding  the  so-called  cartoon,  I   saw  no  humour  in  it  whatsoever.  In   fact  it  is  tasteless,  unfeeling  and  would,  I  believe,  be  deeply  offensive   to  Christians.  I  wonder  if  we  would  like  it  if  someone  ridiculed  some  of   our  traditions  like  we  have  Christian  ones.  I  think  not!  The  fact  that  we  have  very  different  views  on  things  does  not  give  us  permission  to  make  fun.   I  have  discussed  these  matters  with  some  of  my  Jewish  friends  and  family,  and  all  agree  with  me.   I  would  be  ashamed  if  any  of  my  non-Jewish  friends  saw  either  the  buns,  or  even  worse  the  so-called  car  toon.  Do  we  need  to  be  offensive  to  other  religions  to  either  earn  a  dollar  or  get  a  laugh?  Have  we  forgotten  anti  semitism  is  again  growing  and  we  don’t  like  to  be  made  fun  of  either?   EVELYN  MINTZ   Ashbury,  NSW ",2005-04-01
"  Jesus  Inc.:   By  Rachael  Kendrick   When  Hillsong  topped  the  ARIA  charts  last  year  it  unnerved  a  large  part  of  secular  Australia.  No  one  goes  to  church  anymore,  right?  No  one  cares  enough  to,  like,  actually  buy  records  full  of  hymns  and  prayer  songs  and  whatnot,  and  if  they  do  they're  clearly  old  and  humourless  and  highly  unattractive.   This  isn't  a  piece  about  how  church  and  faith  and  spiritual  ity  are,  like,  totally  cool  and  hot  right  now,  nor  is  it  about  my  main  man  JC  and  how  he's  the  best  accessory  your  life  can  have,  because...  no.  I  was  raised  Catholic  but  adhere  now  to  no  religion  save  the  Temple  of  Jim  Waley's  Pants,  but  it's  impossible  to  ignore  the  rising  commercial  success  of  faith  of  all  kinds.  It's  a  far  cry  from  the  grim  suburban  churches  of  my  youth,  where  the  leatheroleum  covers  of  the  bibles  reeked  of  benzene  and  contained  the  occasional  faceless,  fingerless  illustration  of  a  'Figure  in  Simple  Gar  ments  Praising  The  Lord',  as,  indeed,  we  all  should.  To  my  mind  the  good  Christian  was  like  those  simple  little  draw  ings  -  bland,  happy,  but  completely  without  personality.  Or  eyes.  Or  nose.  Or  mouth.  The  website  of  the  Hillsong  church  (www.hillsong.com  if  you  want  to  check  it  out)  tells  a  very  different  story.  Pastors  Brian  and  Bobbie  Houston  have  personality,  even  if,  per  sonally,  I  find  that  personality  mildly  creepy.  Clear-skinned,  bouncy-haired  and  toothy  Brian  and  Bobbie  are  a  deeply  committed  married  couple  who  steer  their  Hillsong  tshirt  clad  flock  through  troubled  modern  waters,  advising  them  on  how  to  'Make  Wise  Decisions  and  Embrace  Woman  hood'.  And,  lookit,  you  too  can  experience  Brian  and  Bob  bie  in  the  privacy  of  your  own  home  with  CDs  of  their  ser  mons  (only  AUD$22!).  And  we  can't  forget  the  astonishing  success  of  Hillsong's  music,  which  has  ridden  on  Darlene  Zschech's  blonde  shoulders  all  the  way  to  the  top  of  the  ARIA  charts  and  notoriety.  Darlene's  saintly  voice  was  oozing  from  the  speakers  at  Koorong,  a  Christian  superstore  on  the  fringes  of  Fyshwick.  At  least  I  think  it  was,  as  her  face  was  plastered  all  over  the  music  section  of  the  store.  Koorong  is  a  sort  of  Christian  Dymocks  slash  Amazon  that  was  opened  all  the  way  back  in  1978  and  blossomed  over  the  years  into  a  nation-wide  franchise.  Their  website  is  neat  and  professional,  the  Fy  shwick  store  as  bright  and  clean  as  any  other  large  chain  bookstore  in  the  country,  and  everywhere  book  titles  urge   you  to  Live  Life  with  Purpose  while  Darlene  sings  sweetly  in  the  background.  For  someone  without  particularly  reli  gious  beliefs  it's  unsettling,  but  I  can  see  how  the  store  has  been  so  successful  with  the  Christian  community.  I  spoke  with  the  manager,  Rob  Brewer,  about  the  success  of  the  store.  He  explained  that  the  store  was  something  of  a  destination  for  local  -Christians?  who  -went  therefor  the  startling  array  of  Christian  music,  books  like  Purpose  Driven  Life,  and  bibles  designed  to  co-ordinate  with  any  |  outfit.  Koorong  seems  to  be  more  than  just  a  bookstore;  it's  |  designed  to  sell  a  complete  Christian  lifestyle,  where  kids  I  can  get  their  Veggie  Tales,  teenagers  can  get  their  MXPX,  j  and  adults  can  buy  guides  to  good  Christian  marriage  and  parenting.  Not  that  everyone  is  completely  happy.  'Some-  times  customers  will  complain,  saying  what  are  you  sell-  I  ing  this  for?'  Rob  told  me.  'So  it's  always  a  bit  of  a  battle,  because  not  everyone's  beliefs  are  exactly  the  same.  So  some  of  them  might  not  agree  with  one  author,  or  might  not  like  the  style  of  music.'  But  he  agreed  that  interest  in  |  the  church  is  booming.  'Just  judging  by  society  as  a  whole  j  there  seems  to  be  a  lot  of  people  getting  back  into  it.  I  mean,  the  Hillsong's  a  classic  example,  the  Pentecostal  churches  are  growing  so  that's  making  a  big  difference.  A  lot  of  people  that  weren't  going  to  a  church  are  now  getting  involved,  back  into  it  through  the  Pentecostal  churches.'  If  interest  in  the  church  is  booming,  then  so  too  are  the  commercial  gains  to  be  made  from  this  growing  niche  mar  ket.  However,  I  still  find  myself  asking  the  question,  why  this  new,  Cosmo-ish  makeover  for  old  time  religion?  Is  it  a  matter  of  survival?  Is  faith  just  so  dissonant  with  the  con  temporary  world,  so  irrelevant,  that  they  have  to  dress  it  in  the  garb  of  modernity  and  make  flashy  promises  of  eternal  salvation  and  a  never-ending  supply  of  friends  who  won't  try  to  touch  your  goodies  in  order  to  bring  people  back?  Or,  in  these  increasingly  complex  times,  where  the  gap  be  tween  rich  and  poor  yawns  wider  day  by  day,  where  eve  ryone  is  screwing  everyone  else  but  no  one  cares,  when  the  most  powerful  nation  on  earth  can  be  whipped  into  an  uproar  about  Janet  Jackson's  nipple  but  ignore  poor  peo  ple  dying  on  the  streets  of  New  Orleans,  is  faith  the  best  way  of  staying  sane?  When  there's  little  to  hold  on  to  in  a  post-post-modern,  post-MTV,  capitalist  world,  does  faith  provide  a  vital  toehold  for  those  who  need  it?   'However,  I  still  find  myself  asking  the  question,  why  this  new,  Cosmo-ish  makeover  for  old  time  religion?  Is  it  a  matter  of  survival?  Is  faith  just  so  dissonant  with  the  contemporary  world,  so  ir  relevant,  that  they  have  to  dress  it  in  the  garb  of  modernity  and  make  flashy  promises  of  eternal  salvation  and  a  never-ending  supply  of  friends  who  won't  try  to  touch  your  goodies  in  order  to  bring  people  back?'   its  ?  I  Truth  be  told,  I  don't  entirely  buy  eitherfergument.  Try  as  you  cool  atheist  kids  might,  God  and  filfe  people  who  be  lieve  in  the  entity  sometimes  known  as;  -§od  (ha,  take  that  gender-specific  pronoun!)  aren't  as  stupid  as  you  like  to  think.  I  once  saw  a  documentary  about  astronomer  Jesuit  priests,  and  one  of  them  explained  that  most  of  us  only  ^learn^bout-science-or-faith~up-to™trW^age  often,  so  most  of  us  have  a  ten-year  old's  understanding  of  God.  I'm  very  willing  to  cop  that,  and  request  that  the  sniggering  atheists  in  the  crowd  stow  it  for  a  few  more  paragraphs.  But  I  also  don't  think  the  world  is  any  more  or  less  chaotic  now  than  it  has  been  in  the  past  what  with  chaos  having  a  way  of  catching  up  with  all  who  try  and  avoid  it.  So,  I  don't  think  the  church  is  either  trying  to  dupe  people  into  coming  over  to  the  dark  side,  nor  do  I  think  we're  a  collection  of  disori  ented  stragglers  looking  for  sanctuary.  So,  what's  the  deal?  Looking  around  Koorong  I  few  dry  biblical  tracts  and  no  dyspeptic-looking  nuns  gazing  heav  enward,  no  bleeding  saints  or  paintings  of  Jesus  pointing  to  his  glowing  heart.  What  I  did  see  were  dozens,  if  not  hundreds,  of  guides  on  how  to  live  a  better  life.  One  ti  tle,  No  Perfect  People  Allowed,  caught  my  eye.  I  read  the  blurb  and  it  said  how  there  was  so  much  pressure  in  the  contemporary  church  to  be  a  perfect  person  with  a  perfect  life,  it  didn't  really  leave  room  for  the  mistakes  everyone  makes.  I'm  not  sure  which  is  worse  in  terms  of  guilt  -  a  Saint  Augustinian  treatise  on  the  sins  of  the  flesh  and  how  your  immortal  soul  is  already  going  to  rot  in  hell  unless  you  repent,  sinner;  or  a  book  on  ideal  Christian  parenting  gently  reminding  you  that  if  your  children  grow  up  to  be  less-than-ideal  it's  probably  because  you  didn't  really  try  hard  enough.  In  this  way,  the  new  hip  church  is  not  so  different  from  any  other  orthodoxy  in  our  society,  from  the  Atkins  cult  con  demning  your  sinful  love  of  bagels  to  Cosmo  urging  you  to  please  your  man.  We're  all  expected  to  be  perfect,  and  if  I  may  be  permitted  to  get  my  preacher  on,  isn't  there  a  little  of  Hilary  Faye,  the  shrill  blonde  Pharisee  from  the  bril  liant  satire  'Saved,'  in  all  of  us?  In  some  way  aren't  we  all  screeching  'I  am  filled  with  the  love  of  Christ!'  while  pulling  someone's  hair?   Of  course,  Christianity  isn't  the  be-all  and  end-all  of  faith  and  spirituality.  There  are  many  other  avenues  to  God,  or  whatever  you'd  like  to  call  it,  and  everyone  from  Madonna  to  Richard  Gere  are  getting  down  with  the  Dalai  Lama,  twisting  themselves  into  yogic  serenity  and  tying  one  on  with  Kabbalah.  To  that  end  I  visited  The  Hierophant,  a  fra  grant  hobbit  hole  of  a  store  above  Griffith  Shops.  The  Hi  erophant  has  catering  to  the  esoteric,  the  spiritual  and  the  homeopathically  inclined  in  Canberra  for  17  years,  and  I  spoke  to  manager  Rovaye  Hobbs  about  the  curious  souls  who  find  their  way  there.  She  told  me  the  interests  of  her  customers  were  widerang  ing,  from  Buddhism  to  Jungian  philosophy.  'People  [come  here]  looking  for  music,  books  on  different  traditions,  we  have  a  very  small  Christian  section,  but  people  that  come  here  are  tending  to  look  for  Buddhism,  Hinduism,  a  little  bit  of  Islam,  the  concepts  of  meditation...  connecting  to  the  goddess  energy,  women  trying  to  connect  with  themselves  on  a  more  female  basis...  people  are  trying  to  find  them  selves  in  the  centre  of  chaos.'  She  felt  people  now  are  more  overtly  seeking  a  greater  meaning  in  their  lives,  and  encourages  people  to  sit  and  read  in  the  store.  Certainly,  The  Hierophant  feels  much  less  urgent  than  Koorong.  Rather  than  trying  to  shoehorn  customers  into  a  particular  spiritual  special  interest  group,  customers  are  allowed  to  take  things  at  their  own  pace.  'I  think  [people]  realise  that  the  material  world  is  not  the  be-all  and  end-all,  and  I  think  a  lot  of  them  have  been  disillusioned  by  Christi  anity,  or  it  doesn't  have  the  essence  of  what  they're  looking  for.  So,  they  explore  other  traditions.'  Do  the  customers  of  The  Hierophant  have  a  shopping  cart  approach  to  faith,  picking  and  choosing  what  they  like  with  out  really  committing?  Is  this  a  bad  thing?  Is  there  anything  wrong  with  people  exploring  beyond  the  material  until  they  find  something  that  resonates?  This  little  non-atheist,  non-Catholic  has  no  answers,  but  I  do  know  that  if  you're  going  to  cash  in  on  God  now  is  the  time.  And  I  can  surely  tell  you  my  Church  of  Jim  Waley  and  latter-day  Newsreader  shrines  and  altars  are  doing  brilliantly  on  Ebay. ",2005-09-01

"  Anti-missionary  US   rabbi  delivers  warning   SEVENTY-EIGHT  million   evangelical  Christians  in  the  USA  spend  more  than  $US250  million  a  year  in  a  “massive  cru  sade  to  convert  Jews”.   These  were  the  shocking  statistics  imparted  by  Rabbi  Bentzion  Kravitz,  executive  director  of  the  Los  Angeles  branch  of  the  cult-busting  Jews  for  Judaism,  who  was  in  Syd  ney  last  week.   He  spoke  to  audiences  at  the  Great  Synagogue,  Central  Syn  agogue,  Chabad  Double  Bay  and  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies.   “Deceptive,  misleading  and  manipulative”  organisations  such  as  Jews  for  Jesus  target  young  Jews  in  a  worldwide  effort  including  Australia,  he   said.   Differences  between  Judaism  and  cults  such  as  Jews  for  Jesus  are  not  theological,  he  said.   Legitimate  religions  looking  to  persuade  others  of  their  worth  encourage  thinking,  examining,  exploring,  he  said.   Jews  for  Jesus,  however,  is  a  cult  which  tries  to  break  down  its  followers’  ability  for  critical  thought.

"  Abraham’s  acclaim   PETER  KOHN   REGIONAL  centres  around  Aus  tralia  will  benefit  from  a  decision  to  turn  Project  Abraham,  a  successful  South  Australian  inter-faith  initia  tive  which  has  brought  together   Jews  and  Muslims  for  cultural  events,  into  a  national  initiative.   An  approach  to  Project  Abra  ham  organisers  from  the  Depart  ment  of  Immigration,  Multicultural  and  Indigenous  Affairs  (DIMIA),  through  its  Part  nerships  program,  has  resulted  in  a  $130,000  grant  to  extend  the  two  year-old,  Adelaide-based  program   Australia-wide.   Jewish  Community  Council  of  South  Australia  president  Norman  Schueler  described  the  coup  as  “a  prime  example  of  what  can  be  achieved  by  the  actions  of  a  group   of  dedicated  individuals”.   Project  Abraham,  named  after  the  biblical  patriarch  of  Judaism,  Islam  and  Christianity,  began  in   2003  when  American-born  Kather  ine  Goode,  an  Adelaide  educator  and  journalist,  set  up  a  steering  committee  with  a  grant  of  $40,000  from  the  Federal  Government’s  Liv   mg  in  Harmony  initiative  to  com  bat  rising  levels  of  disharmony   between  Jews  and  Muslims.   The  committee  planned  a  series  of  six  lectures  which  took  place  the  following  year.   Goode  told  the  AJN  the  semi  nars  -  supported  by  all  major  Jew  ish,  Islamic  and  Christian  groups  in   Adelaide  -  involved  students  and  resources  from  Massada  College  and  from  the  Islamic  College  of   South  Australia.   The  program  proved  so  success  ful  that  DIMIA  invited  the  Project  Abraham  steering  committee  to  create  a  national  program  under  its  Partnerships  initiative.  The  national  program  will  feature  seminars,  school  programs  and  a  travelling   exhibition.   Starting  in  March  next  year,  the  exhibition  will  be  staged  in  a  differ  ent  regional  locality  each  month,  with  Jewish,  Muslim  and  Christian  speakers.   The  inter-faith  roadshow  will   visit  five  country  centres  -  Whyalla,  Murray  Bridge  and  Renmark  in  South  Australia,  Shepparton  in  Vic   toria  and  Gosford  in  NSW. ",2005-10-28
"  Peace  prospects  spark  hope  for  economy   GIL  SEDAN   JERUSALEM  -  One  party  follows  another  at  the  Tel  Aviv  stock  exchange,  and  the  brokers  just  keep  smiling.  Tuesday  was  a  typical  day  at  the  exchange.  Right  after  trade  started,  the  market  jumped  .2  per  cent.

Delegates  from  30  countries  forecast  greater  and  greater  windfalls  for  the  industry  Next  week,   Tourism  Minister  Avraham   Hirschsohn  and  his  PA  counterpart,  Matri  abu-Aita,  will  meet  with  Pope  John  Paul  II  in  an  attempt  to  increase  Christian  pilgrimage  to  the  Holy   Land.   The  Tourism  Ministry  expects  about  700,000  Christian  tourists  this  year  and  thinks  that  about  250,000  of  them  will  be  pilgrims.  Last  year  Israel  hosted  500,000  Christian  tourists,  including  150,000  pilgrims.   The  Israel  Hotel  Association   expects  some  1.8  million  tourists  in  Israel  this  year,  up  from  1.5  million  last  year.   If  the  situation  remains  quiet  and  tourism  picks  up,  the  Palestinians  stand  to  gain  right  away.  Now  that  Jericho  is  about  to  be  returned  to  PA  control,  the  company  operating  the  casino  is  considering  reopening  it   In  the  two  years  that  it  was  open,  the  casino  drew  825,000  visitors,  99  per  cent  of  them  Israeli.  The  casino,  which  closed  shortly  after  the  intifada  began  in  fall  2000,  made  a  profit  of  about  $US54  million  in  1999.   Yet  many  remain  sceptical  of  the  rosy  forecasts.  And  while  the  dreams  are  promising,  the/re  hardly  new.   The/re  the  same  dreams  that  were  common  until  four  and  a  half  years  ago,  when  the  Palestinians  turned  to  terrorism,  prompting  Israeli  counter  measures  and  security  closures.  The  intifada  has  led  to  a  precipitous  drop  in  the  Palestinian  standard  of  living,  and  contributed  to  several  years  of   recession  in  Israel.   While  Israel’s  economy  has  bounced  back,  the  Palestinians  are  sinking  further  into  poverty,  handi  capped  until  recently  by  an  inept  and  corrupt  government  that  misused  bil   lions  of  dollars  and  invested  in  terror  ism  rather  than  development.   Still,  most  economic  analysts  agree  that  for  the  first  time  in  four  years,  recent  developments  in  the  region  present  a  good  chance  for  economic   progress.

The  forecast  for  the  Israeli  econo   my  is  bright.

"  SHARP  RISE  IN  AUSSIE  TOURISTS  TO  ISRAEL   DANNY  GOCS   THE  number  of  Australians  visit-   ing  Israel  has  jumped  by  60  per  cent  in  the  past  year,  according  to  the  Israel  Tourism  Office  in  Sydney.   In  the  nine  months  to  October  there  were  almost  12,000  visitors  from  Australia,  while  a  total  of  1,248,000  from  around  the  world  visited  Israel  during  the  same  peri-  od,  an  increase  of  46  per  cent  over   2003.   The  director  of  the  Israel  Tourism  Office,  Dr  David  Beirman,  said  that  although  final  figures  for   2004  will  not  be  known  until  next   month,  he  predicts  the  year’s  total  for  Australia  could  reach  15,000.   “We  are  delighted  with  the  number  of  visitors,”  Dr  Beirman  said.  “The  Australian  Jewish  com-  munity  has  been  a  leader  in  encouraging  people  to  travel  to   Israel.”   He  said  there  has  been  a  strong  recovery  since  2002  when  the   intifada  caused  the  total  number  of  Australian  visitors  to  drop  to  8,600.   Dr  Beirman  said  there  was  a  lot  of  interest  in  Israel  from  non-Jews,  especially  religious  groups  keen  to  make  a  pilgrimage  to  holy  sites  in  Jerusalem.   “In  2003  about  60  per  cent  of  Australian  visitors  to  Israel  were  non-Jewish  and  the  worldwide  percentage  of  non-Jews  was  even  higher,”  he  said.   “The  big  Christian  evangelical   groups  which  have  given  Israel  a  miss  in  recent  years  are  coming  back  and  tour  wholesalers  are  showing  interest  again  in  putting  Israel  back  into  their  brochures.”   A  major  step  forward  in  tourism  relations  between  the  Israeli  gov-  ernment  and  the  Palestinians  took  place  last  November  with  the  sign  ing  of  an  agreement  to  improve  access  to  holy  sites  in  Israel  and  the   Palestinian  territories.   Dr  Beirman  said  one  of  the  changes  under  the  agreement  is  easier  access  to  Bethlehem,  which  is  an  important  destination  for   Christian  visitors.

"  stories   women   BOOK  REVIEW   GAEL  HAMMER   PIOUS  AND  REBELLIOUS:  JEWISH  WOMEN  IN  MEDIEVAL  EUROPE   Avraham  Grossman   Brandeis  University  Press,  $55   IT  is  hard  to  imagine  a  book  about  medieval  Jewish  women  being  a  best  seller,  but  in  Israel,  Pious  and  Rebel  lious:  Jewish  Women  in  Medieval  Europe  was  a  huge  success.   What  makes  Pious  and  Rebellious  so  compelling,  even  though  it  is  writ  ten  by  a  “cautious”  historian?  I  think  the  answer  is  that  Avraham  Grossman  loves  these  ancient  Jewish  women  and  his  affection  for  them  shines  through   in  the  text.   Grossman  describes  the  lives  of   women  who  were  remarkably  inde  pendent  and  powerful.  Although  they  were  often  married  off  in  infancy,  and  certainly  between  the  ages  of  12  and  16,  their  husbands  would  often  leave  them  for  years  at  a  time  while  they  engaged  in  international  trade.  As  a  result,  these  women  were  left  to  sup  port  their  households  and  raise  their  children  alone,  and  in  this  they   excelled.   The  primary  activity  of  Jews  in  Europe  was  money-lending,  and  the  women  too  ran  loan  portfolios,   sometimes  with  their  husbands  and  families  and  sometimes  on  their  own.   Many  amassed  considerable  personal  wealth  and  prestige  because  women’s  businesses  created  opportunities  for  alliances  with  the  gentile  ruling   classes.   Economics,  says  Grossman,  is  the  key  to  understanding  the  status  of  Jewish  women  in  the  years  1000  1300.  The  significant  advances  made   by  women  in  this  period  can  be  linked  to  their  financial  power,  as  well  as  the  status  of  women  in  gentile  Europe.   The  changes  in  family  law  during  this  era  were  far-reaching.  Beginning  in  the  seventh  century,  women  were  able  to  obtain  a  divorce  against  their   husbands’  will  and  take  their  own  money  as  well  as  marriage  contract  settlement  with  them.  This  rule  lasted   500  years,  during  which  the  break-up  of  marriages  became  so  rampant  that  rabbis  began  issuing  a  series  of  increasingly  draconian  monetary  penalties  on  women  when  they  exer  cised  the  power  to  force  divorce  on  their  husbands.   But  despite  these  financial  dis  couragements,  women’s  apparent  desire  to  be  separated  from  their  hus   bands  continued  unabated.  This  is  remarkable  both  because  it  showed   women  were  confident  in  their  ability  to  support  themselves,  and  because  jt   was  such  a  contrast  to  the  situation  in  the  Christian  world,  where  divorce  was  nonexistent   The  ban  against  polygyny  was  enacted  in  Western  Europe  in  this  era,  perhaps  in  response  to  married  men  travelling  to  other  lands  for  business  and  taking  second  wives  while  away.  The  first  wives  were  often  abandoned,  and  the  rabbis  abhorred  such  behav   iour.  A  twin  ruling  forbade  a  man  to  divorce  a  wife  against  her  will.  The  net  result  was  that  for  a  couple  of  centuries,  women  could  divorce  men  against  the  men’s  will,  but  not  vice  versa.   Also  at  this  time,  the  penalties  against  men  for  abusing  their  wives  greatly  increased,  and  included  imposing  corporal  punishment  -  “cutting  off  his  hand”  -  and  ex  communicating  the  abusive  husband.   In  the  spiritual  realm,  Western  European  women  battled  for,  and  won,  the  right  to  say  blessings  over  rit  uals  which  they  were  permitted,  but  not  obligated,  to  perform  -  for  exam  ple,  the  blessing  over  lulav  and  etrog  on  Succot.  In  Germany,  women  acted  as  sandeka’it  -  holding  their  sons  or  grandsons  during  the  circumcision.  Rabbinic  leaders  fought  to  end  this  practice  on  the  basis  of  it  being  an   immodest  intrusion  of  a  woman  into   the  synagogue.  But  for  a  long  time,  the  women  prevailed,  perhaps  because  the  infants’  fathers  were  so  often  away.   Grossman  has  a  particular  soft  spot  for  one  woman,  Dulca,  mur  dered  by  Christian  rioters,  and  elegised  by  her  husband  in  a  moving  poem.  She  “was  among  those  who  assisted  in  providing  supplies  for  the  synagogue,  and  ...  visited  [there]  fre  quently,  taking  care  to  arrive  early  for  prayer  and  to  leave  the  synagogue  late,  so  as  not  to  make  her  prayer   appear  as  if  it  were  a  burden  ...  [she  took]  care  to  pray  daily,  morning  and  evening.  She  taught  other  women  how  to  pray  and  embellish  the  prayer   with  music.”   Women  such  as  Duica  played  criti  cal  roles  during  the  persecution  of  the  Jews  in  the  medieval  era,  becoming  martyr  figures  and  encouraging  their  husbands  and  children  not  to  give  in   to  the  rioters’  demands  to  convert.   There  is  not  a  single  work  written  by  women  from  this  era  that  Gross  man  has  uncovered  -  not  in  law,  mys  ticism,  or  kabbalah  -  which  shocks  him,  particularly  since  creative  writ  ing  by  both  Christian  and  Muslim  women  has  survived.  He  theorises  that  women’s  work  was  centred  around  the  home,  and  that  in  a  hos  tile  Diaspora,  bearing  children  and  keeping  diem  alive  to  adulthood  was  immensely  difficult  and  had  recog  nised  spiritual  value.  They  were  involved  in  household  and  business  management  immediately  upon  leav  ing  childhood.   I  disagree  with  Grossman  that  nothing  in  writing  survives  from  our  Jewish  medieval  ancestors.  What  of  the  money-lending  ledgers?  Why  are  they  not  evidence  of  the  creativity  of   women,  of  their  drive  to  survive  and   succeed?  Why  are  they  not  as  impres  sive  as  works  of  philosophy  and  mysticism?   Ashkenazi  Jews  exist  today  because  of  the  resourcefulness  of  the  women  Grossman  describes,  their  financial  genius,  their  flexibility  in  the  face  of  constantiy-changing  circumstances  and  their  refusal  to  submit  to  their  Christian  oppressors.

"  Mutual  recognition  of  pain  is  the  inter-faith  key,  says  professor   MARK  FRANKLIN   “HOW  do  we  hear  the  pain  of  Pales  tinians  and  Jews  at  the  same  time?”  asked  world-leading  ecumenical  pro  fessor,  Sister  Mary  Boys,  at  the  NSW  Council  for  Christians  and  Jews  (CCJ)  AGM  on  Tuesday  night.   Delivering  the  keynote  speech,  the  renowned  American  scholar  told  Jew  ish  and  Christian  leaders  that  the   foundation  of  religious  dialogue  is   “an  awareness  of  what  hurts  the  other”.   While  she  said  strong  Christian  awareness  of  Jewish  sensitivities  has  developed  in  the  last  40  years,  she   added:   “Christians  in  their  various  ways  have  little  sense  of  the  way  in  which  Jerusalem  is  at  the  centre  of  Jewish  life,  in  terms  of  rituals  and  longing  and  traditions,  because  they  don’t  have  anything  comparable  in  Christ   ian  life.”   This,  she  said,  made  it  difficult  to  understand  the  concept  of  Zionism  and  its  importance  in  modern  Jewish  life.  Professor  Boys  also  acknowl  edged  the  importance  of  reflecting  on  past  mistakes  rather  than  ignoring   them.  “The  church’s  intensified  awareness  of  Shoah  scholarship  has  helped  us  understand  the  fertile   ground  that  the  churches  helped  cre  ate  for  genocide,”  she  said.   This  October  28  will  mark  the  40th  anniversary  of  Nostra  Aetate,  the  landmark  Papal  document  which  denounced  antisemitism  and  declared  the  Jews  were  innocent  of  killing  Christ.   “Most  in  the  church  tend  to  hear  more  of   Palestinian  pain  than  they  do  of  Israel’s  pain,  but  we  can't  just  respond  to  one  pain  or  the  other,  we  have  to  respond  to  both.”   SISTER  MARY  BOYS  Ecumenical  Professor   Responding  to  Professor  Boys,  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  director  of  international  and  com   munity  affairs  Jeremy  Jones  said  awareness  of  each  other’s  pain  was  a  crucial  point.

"  Classic  response  to  Jews  for  Jesus   BOOK  REVIEW   GEOFFREY  TOFLER   THE  REAL  MESSIAH?  A  JEWISH  RESPONSE  TO  MISSIONARIES  Aryeh  Kaplan   National  Conference  of  Synagogue  Youth,  $16   THE  recent  Jews  for  Jesus  move  into  -!Bondi  Junction  and  Caulfield  begs   the  question:  “What  is  the  Jewish  response  to  Jesus?”   Our  ancestors  rejected  Jesus  as  the  Messiah.  Why  this  rejection  con  tinues  to  be  appropriate  for  Jews  is  well  stated  by  Aryeh  Kaplan  in  The  Real  Messiah?  A  Jewish  response  to   missionaries.   First  published  in  1976,  with  a  recent  eighth  printing,  this  slim  paperback  is  an  excellent  resource.   The  book  provides  important  background  and  suggestions  on  how  best  to  respond  to  Jews  for  Jesus.   The  story  powerfully  tells  the  tra  vails  of  a  university  student  who  is  ensnared,  but  manages  to  find  her  way  back  to  Judaism.   I  found  Kaplan’s  summary  of  the  ological  differences  between  Chris  tianity  and  Judaism  very  useful,  as  is  his  critique  of  attempts  to  use  Torah   and  Talmud  to  bolster  the  Messianic  role  of  Jesus.   The  depiction  of  the  13th-century  debate  between  Rabbi  Nachmanides   (Ramban)  and  Catholics  is  fascinat  ing,  with  Ramban  speaking  boldly,  refuting  arguments  that  Christian  faith  is  foretold  in  Jewish  texts.   Kaplan  could  well  have  been  writ  ing  about  Australia  in  2005  when  he  says:  “You  look  at  the  sign  Jews  for  Jesus  and  wonder  what’s  going  on.  Before  you  know  it,  one  of  the  Jews  for  Jesus  asks  how  you  feel  about  your  Jewishness  ...  you  admit  that  deep  down  a  spiritual  dimension  is  missing  from  your  life.   I  We  do  not  seek  to   attack  other  faiths,  but  Jews  for  Jesus  is   attacking  Judaism  and   |  this  book  is  a  strong   1  and  necessary  defence.   “He  sympathises  and  tells  you  the  reason  Judaism  does  not  fulfill  this  need  is  that  you  have  left  out  an  essential  ingredient.  Then  he  gives  you  the  punchline.  To  be  a  true  Jew,  you  must  believe  in  Jesus.  Only  then,  so  he  says,  can  Judaism  provide  that  dimension  you  are  seeking.”   Do  not  be  deceived,  warns  Kaplan.  You  have  a  lot  to  lose.  Kaplan  is  clear  that  you  won’t  convince  missionaries  their  claims  are  false  nor  should  you  debate,  since  it  lends  credence  and  dignity  to  their  efforts  at  soul  snatching.   There  are  millions  of  non-practis  ing  Christians  available  for  their   efforts.   Missionaries  are  closed-minded  and  trained  to  respond  to  arguments  with  memorised  answers.  Public  attack  surrounds  them  with  martyrdom.   Instead,  get  the  facts,  plan  and  pro  vide  opportunities  for  meaningful   A  Jews  for  Jesus  billboard  In  Caulfield  ripped  by  angry  protestors  earlier  this  year.

Instead,  it  is  incompatible  with  and  an  abandonment  of  Judaism.   To  the  belief  that  Jesus  was  the  Messiah  predicted  by  prophets  of  the  Bible  and  awaited  by  Jews,  Kaplan  responds  that  Jesus  could  not  have  been  the  Jewish  Messiah.   The  prophets  predicted  that  the   Messiah  would  usher  in  a  world  of   peace  and  unity  which  would  mean   an  end  to  evil  and  hatred.   None  of  this  exists  today.  To  the  Jew,  the  Messiah  is  expected  to  com  plete  his  mission  on  his  first  attempt.   Nowhere  in  the  Torah  is  a  Second  Coming  described.   Also  incompatible  with  Judaism  is  the  belief  that  Jesus  is  the  son  of  God  and  that  man’s  prayers  must  go  via   Jesus  rather  than  directly  to  God.   A  third  Christian  belief  is  that   through  Adam,  man  is  originally  sin  ful  and  that  only  belief  in  Christ  pre  vents  man’s  damnation  in  hell.  In  contrast,  although  the  Torah  men  tions  Adam’s  sin,  man  can  surmount  it.   If  Christians  merely  believed  that  Jesus  was  their  Messiah,  this  belief  would  be  of  little  concern  to  Jews.   However,  Jews  must  be  armed  with  facts  to  substantiate  conviction   of  the  falsity  of  claims  that  Jesus  is  our  Messiah,  the  Jewish  Messiah  foretold  by  the  prophets.   We  do  not  seek  to  attack  other  faiths,  but  Jews  for  Jesus  is  attacking  Judaism  and  this  book  is  a  strong  and  necessary  defence.

"  Cardinal  Edward  Cassidy  with   Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  at  last   week’s   celebration  of  the  40th   anniversary  of   Nostra  Aetate  at  Sydney’s  Great  Synagogue.   Photo:  Ingrid  ""&gt;  Shakenovsky   Nostra  a  landmark,  but   ‘bitter  agony’  still  prevails   JACQUI  GAL   NOSTRA  Aetate  —  the  Catholic  Church’s  landmark  document  which   absolved  the  Jews  of  the  charge  of  killing  Jesus  -  was  important,  but  there  is  still  a  long  way  to  go  towards  full  rec   onciliation  between  Catholics  and  Jews.   This  was  the  view  of  Rabbi  Ray  mond  Apple,  the  Great  Synagogue’s   emeritus  rabbi  and  a  co-founder  of  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews,  in  his  address  to  more  than  500  people  at  a  ceremony  last  week  to  mark  the  40th  anniversary  of  Nostra  Aetate.   “We  need  to  face  another  40-year  challenge,”  he  said.  “The  church  con  signed  to  history  the  doctrine  that  Christians  had  superseded  Jews  as  the  people  of  God  -  though  it  allowed  itself  to  perpetuate  historical  errors  such  as  ‘the  Jewish  authorities  ...  pressed  for  the  death  of  Christ’.   “There  are  Jewish  and  Christian  scholars  who  object  that  the  document  seems  to  be  forgiving  the  Jewish  peo  ple  for  a  crime  that  history  proves  they  did  not  commit.  They  see  a  major  dif  ficulty  in  the  references  to  Jewish  lead  ers  having  pressed  for  Jesus’  death,”  Rabbi  Apple  added.   He  also  noted  the  “bitter  agony”  suffered  by  the  Jews  when  the  Catholic  Church  was  silent  in  the  face  of  the  Six-Day  War.  He  noted  “the  Auschwitz  convent  episode,  the  proposed  beatifi  cation  of  individuals  with  inappropri  ate  attitudes  to  Jews,  the  withholding  of  certain  archival  material,  the  per   ceived  whitewashing  of  the  wartime  pope,  the  lack  of  protest  when  the  president  of  Syria  exploited  the  pope’s  visit  to  make  outrageous  statements  about  Jews,  and  the  apparent  silence  when  terrorism  attacked  Israel  and  Israelis.   “There  is,  of  course,  also  the  pecu  liar  reception  of  Mel  Gibson’s  film,  The  Passion  of  the  Christ?  he  added,  “which  is  a  sheer  travesty  of  history,  and  possi  bly  also  a  willingness  for  reconciliation  with  groups  of  Catholics  who  have   never  come  to  terms  with  Vatican  II   and  certainly  not  with  Nostra  Aetate  with  its  respect  and  toleration  of  other  religions”.   Rabbi  David  Rosen,  the  American  Jewish  Committee’s  director  of  Inter  religious  Affairs,  said,  via  video  link  up,  that  the  document  was  the  “most  dramatic  transformation  in  the  course  of  human  history”.   Rabbi  Rosen  said  the  Jewish  people  had  been  traditionally  presented  in  Christian  tradition  as  “a  people  cursed  and  condemned  to  wander  until  they  would  recognise  the  true  dispensation.   “Therefore,  whatever  suffering  that   was  incurred  was  more  or  less  to  be  expected,  and...  there  was  a  demonisa  tion  of  the  people  that  facilitated  some  of  the  most  terrible  things  in  European  history  and,  maybe,  indeed  even  in  world  history.”   Nostra  Aetate  changed  this  by  stat  ing  “the  Jews  should  not  be  presented  as  rejected  or  accursed  by  God,  as  if  this  followed  from  the  Holy  Scriptures”,  he  said.   By  enshrining  this  volte-face  in  a  document,  Rabbi  Rosen  said  the  maintenance  of  these  sentiments   would  not  rely  on  the  beliefs  of  any  future  Catholic  leadership.   “It  is  now  enshrined  in  the  very  fab  ric  of  the  church,”  he  said.   The  celebrations,  chaired  by  NSW  Governor  Professor  Marie  Bashir,  included  speeches  from  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  David  Knoll  and  Cardinal  Edward  Cassidy,  who  launched  his  book  at  the  event,  as  well  as  a  pre-recorded  video  message  from  Cardinal  Walter  Casper  from  the   Vatican.   Speaking  from  the  Vatican,  Cardi  nal  Casper,  the  president  of  the  Pontif  ical  Council  for  Promoting  Christian  Unity  and  the  Holy  See’s  Commission  for  Religious  Relations  with  the  Jews,  emphasised  the  importance  of  reach  ing  younger  generations,  who  would  perceive  Nostra  Aetate  as  “a  distant  and  historical  event”.   “Yet  the  contrary  is  true,”  he  said.  “The  insights  and  teachings  of  the   council  have  never  been  more  relevant  and  fundamental.  [It]  continues  to  be  the  cornerstone  on  which  to  build  the  future  of  dialogue,  on  which  we  base  the  search  for  full  communion  among  the  baptised;  understanding,  collabo  ration  and  respect  between  Christiani  ty  and  Judaism;  and  the  dialogue  with  other  religions.” ",2005-10-28
"  NO  TEARS  LOST   ROBERT  Sousa  (AJN  6/5)  equates  Jewish  silence  regarding  attacks  on  Jews  for  Jesus  (J4J)  and  Celebrate  Messiah  with  approval.   The  AJN  reported  the  attacks  and  that  is  all  that  is  required.  Extremist  Jews  quite  probably  attacked  those  proselytisers,  but  equating  all  Jews  to  brownshirts  is  antisemitic  stereotyp  ing.  Those  attacks  should  be  con   demned  by  the  general  community  or  by  the  Christian  evangelisers  who  fund  those  groups.   Sousa’s  assertion  that  J4J  are  Jews  is  false.  They  and  their  ilk  are  offensive   and  their  methods  are  false  and   deceptive.  There  is  no  reason  to  invite  a  “jihad”  against  Jews  for  not  weeping   for  our  enemies.

"  Rabbi  one  of  only  two  people  in  pope’s  will   USA  PAUVHERI-BILUG   ROME  -  The  former  chief  rabbi  of  Rome,  Elio  Toaff,  was  one  of  just  two  living  people  mentioned  by  Pope  John  Paul  II  in  his  last   will  and  testament   Rabbi  Toaff,  who  hosted  John  Paul  dur  ing  the  late  pope's  1986  visit  to  a  syna  gogue  in  Rome  -  the  first  time  a  pope  had  ever  visited  a  synagogue  -  was  singled  out   for  thanks.   ""It  gives  me  pleasure  to  know  that  he  remembered  his  friendship  with  me  in  his  testament,""  Toaff  told  the  Jerusalem  Post  “We  always  had  excellent  relations.  After  his  visit  to  the  synagogue  in  1986,  our  relations  became  even  closer.  He  was  a  person  with  a  great  heart,  and  with  a  spir  it  of  brotheihood  that  embraced  all.”   In  his  will  released  by  the  Vatican  last  Thursday,  the  pope  said  he  had  left  no  material  properly  and  had  asked  that  all  his  personal  notes  be  burned.  It  men  tioned  only  two  living  people:  his  personal  secretary,  Archbishop  Stanislaw  Dawisz,  whom  he  thanked  proftisely  for  his  years  of  service,  and  Rabbi  Toaff.   “How  can  I  fail  to  remember,  with  grateful  memory  my  Christian  brothers,  even  those  who  were  not  Catholic?”  he  wrote.  “How  can  I  fail  to  remember  the  rabbi  of  Rome,  and  the  numerous  repre  sentatives  of  non-Christian  religions?”   The  pope,  who  died  on  Saturday,  April  2  at  age  84,  was  buried  in  St  Peter's  Square  last  Friday  in  the  presence  of  at  least  100  heads  of  state,  including  Israeli  President  Moshe  Katsav,  Syrian  President   Pope  John  Paul  II  makes  his  historic  visit  to  Rome’s  Great  Synagogue  on   April  14,1986,  where  he  was  greeted  by  Rabbi  Elio  Toaff,  who  was  then   chief  rabbi.

""It  was  his  birthday,”  Rabbi  Toaff  recalled.  “So  I  decided  to  go  and  wish  him  a  happy  birthday  and  a  speedy  recovery.  His  secretary  met  me  at  the  door  and  said  he  could  not  receive  anyone.  I  said,  no  matter,  kindly  just  go  and  tell  the  pope  I  have  been  here  to  bring  him  my  good  wishes.  His  secretary  did  as  I  had  asked  and  returned,  amazed,  saying  “the  pope  wishes  you  to  enter’.  I  found  him  in  bed,  and  as  I  approached,  he  threw  his  arms  around  my  neck.

"  Our  local  humanitarians  on  a  mission  from  God.   By  Mark  Bousen   While  the  world  responds  with  an  unprecedented  outpouring  of  emotion  and  aid  for  the  victims  of  12  countries  devastated  by  the  Boxing  Day  tsunami,  there  are  heroes  in  the  Torres  Strait  who  undertake  similar  humanitarian  work  almost  on  a  daily  basis.  Howard  and  Glynnis  Heath,  from  Christian  Missions,  live  and  work  in  the  desperately  poor  regions  of  Western  Province  in  Papua-New  Guinea,  100km  from  Thursday  Island  and  only  about  2km  from  Saibai  Island.  ""We  see  hunger,  poverty,  little  or  no  medical  support  (unless  they  come  across  to  Saibai  or  Boigu  Islands);  there  is  not  one  qualified  dentist  in  the  Province.  ""People  live  in  huts  made  of  bush  material,  with  no  electricity,  running  water  or  sanitation.""

""He  changed  our  lives  immediately;  we  didn't  get  out  the  door.""  Glynnis  said  she  had  to  take  Howard  ""kicking  and  screaming""  to  the  Crusdae  and  the  impact  was  immediate.  ""We  were  both  instantly  called  by  the  Holy  Spirit.  We  had  the  boat  and  God  directed  us  to  a  Ministry  that  required  a  boat.  ""We  were  led  to  the  Torres  Strait  and  did  some  ministry  among  the  Islands,  and  we  met  a  delegation  from  Daru  who  were  visiting  here  who  told  us  they  ""had  come  to  get  us""  to  come  up  to  Western  Province.  Both  unanimously  say  they  have  no  regrets  although  there  are  times  when  we  see  the  needs  are  ""so  big  and  we're  so  small"".  ""But  the  rewards  are  so  huge;  we've  changed  thousands  of  lives  through  our  Ministry  as  well  as  giving  humanitarian  aid.""

""Our  feelings  about  our  work  are  essentially  of  elation  and  fulfilment.

A  symbol  of  their  work  is  that  they  have  ""planted""  five  churches  and  will  plant  another  two  when  they  return  at  the  end  of  this  month.  ""We've  been  to  places  where  no  white  person  has  been  before;  and  where  no  boats  have  been  before.""  Howard  and  Glynnis  are  encouraged  by  the  appointment  of  the  new  Governor  of  Western  Province,  Dr  Bob  Danaya,  whom  they  describe  as  a  Christian  man.  ""We  have  meetings  set  down  for  our  next  trip  with  him,  and  we're  confident  circumstances  in  Western  Province  will  change  under  his  leadership.""

"  LES  POLES  DE  COMPETITIVITE,  UNE  AUTRE  MANIERE  DE  DEFINIR  L'INDUSTRIE  DE  DEMAIN.   LE  VOLET  OFFENSIF  DE  L'AMBITION  INDUSTRIELLE  DE  LA  FRANCE   Face  aux  enjeux  de  la  mondialisation,  la  France  lance  une  offensive  nationale  autour  d  f  une  gran  ambition  industrielle  et  annonce  la  création  d'une  vingtaine  de  «pôles  de  compétitivité».  Il  s'agi  construire  des  métropoles  régionales  puissantes,  véritables  territoires  au  sens  large  et  «bouillon  culture»  dans  lesquels  la  notion  de  compétitivité  sera  très  axée  sur  les  aspects  technologiques  et  sc  tifiques.  Et  où  les  entreprises,  ensemble,formeront  sur  un  même  territoire  des  structures  modernes  innovantes  dédiées  à  une  spécialité.   Conformément  à  l'objectif  fixé  en  2000  au  Sommet  de  Lisbonne  de  faire  de  l'Europe  la  première  région  du  monde  pour  sa  compétitivité,  le  comité  interministériel  de  l'aménagement  du  territoire  (CIADT)  a  lancé  le  14   septembre  dernier,  par  la  voix  du  Premier  ministre  Jean-Pierre  Raffarin,  la  nouvelle  politique  industrielle  française.  Résolument  axé  sur  la  constitution  de  pôles  de  compétitivité,  l'objectif  affiché  est  de  renforcer  les  spécialisations  de  l'industrie  française,  créer  les  conditions  favorables  à  l'émergence  de  nouvelles  activités  à  forte  visibilité  internationale  et  améliorer  l'attractivité  des  territoires.  Qu'est-ce  qu'un  pôle   de  compétitivité  ?  Pour  le  CIADT,  c'est  une  «combinaison,  sur  un  territoire  donné,  d'entreprises,  de  centres  de  formation  et  d'unités  de  recherche,  engagés  dans  une  démarche  partenariale  destinée  à  dégager  des  synergies  autour  de  projets  communs  au  caractère  innovant,  et  disposant  de  la  masse  critique  nécessaire  pour  une  visibilité  internationale.»  (1)  Plus  concrètement,  il  s'agit  de  persuader  les  entrepreneurs,  les  chercheurs  et  les  responsables  politiques  locaux  de  travailler  ensemble,  d'encourager  la  mutualisation  des  ressources,  les  groupements  d'achats,  les  locaux  communs,  etc.  De  faire  participer  les  ressources  humaines  au  développement  par  le  groupement  d'em-   ployeurs,  de  favoriser  les  liens  entre  les  industries,  la  recherche  et  l'enseignement,  de  susciter  la  création  d'entreprises,  de  promouvoir  une  politique  de  réseau  au  niveau  européen  et  d'y  associer  les  régions.   Certes,  les  pôles  de  compétitivité  ne  sont  pas  en  soi  une  nouveauté,  puisque  la  France  possède  déjà  quelques  modèles  du  genre.  Avec  par  exemple,  dans  l'Eure-et-Loir,  la  Cosmetic  Valley,  qui  a  généré  en  dix  ans  1.360  emplois.  Ou  le  plateau  de  Palaiseau-   Saclay,  en  région  parisienne  ,  qui  réunit  des  grandes  écoles  -  Ecole  polytechnique,  Ecole  des  hautes  études  commerciales  (HEC)  et  Ecole  supérieure  d'électricité  (Supelec)  -  le  Commissariat  à  l'énergie  atomique  (CEA)  et  des  entreprises,  comme  Thalès  et  Danone.  Et  Sofia-Antipolis,  créée  il  y  a  35  ans  dans  les  Alpes-  Maritimes...  Cependant,  ils  pèsent  encore  peu  dans  l'économie  nationale.  Alors  que  cette  mise  en  réseau  sous  le  nom  de  «clusters»  ou  «districts»  fonctionne  depuis  des  années  avec  succès  aux  Etats-Unis  et  dans  les  autres  pays  européens  comme  le  Danemark,  l'Italie  ou  l'Espagne  avec  la  Galice.   de  t  de  s  de  ienet  De  nombreux  rapports  ont  d'ailleurs  largement  plaidé  pour  leur  développement.  L'étude  de  la  Délégation  à  l'aménagement  du  territoire  (Datar)  (2)  du  23  février  2004  préconisait  plusieurs  mesures  pour  accompagner  les  mutations  économiques,  dont  la  création  de  «systèmes  de  production  locaux»,  appelés  SPL  ou  «pôles  de  compétitivité».  Pour  Nicolas  Jacquet,  son  directeur,  la  France  demeure  bien  une  puissance  industrielle,  mais  elle  change.  Et  la  question  essentielle  réside  dans  la  manière  d'accompagner  ces  mutations.  Car  «l'industrie  de  demain  sera  surtout  consommatrice  de  cerveaux»,  explique-t-il.  Même  diagnostic  dans  le  rapport  du  député  Christian  Blanc,  publié  en  avril  2004  (3).  Intitulé  «Les  pôles  de  compétitivité,  l'industrie  de  demain»,  il  explore  les  moyens  de  faire  évoluer  le  système  français  jugé  trop  vertical  et  trop  cloisonné  et  montre  comment  certains  pays  ou  régions  développés  -  Suède,  Finlande,  Catalogne  ou  Bavière...-  ont  su  rester  compétitifs,  malgré  un  coût  du  travail  élevé.  Et  le  rapport  d'insister  :  «L'innovation  est  le  noyau  dur  de  l'économie  de  demain».  Par  ailleurs,  une  réflexion  autour  de  «la  délocalisation  des  industries  de  main-d'œuvre»,  émanant  d'un  groupe  de  travail  du  Sénat  présidé  par  Christian  Gaudin,  donnait  lieu  en  juin  dernier  à  la  publication  d'un  autre  rapport  mettant  également  en  lumière  la  nécessité  de  s'adapter  aux  mutations  et  d'être  innovants  dans  la  conception  des  produits.  (4)  Enfin,  après  la  création  par  décret  en  octobre  2003  d'une  mission  interministérielle  sur  les  mutations  économiques  (MIML),  le  Premier  ministre  signait,  le  28  janvier  2004,  une  circulaire  sur  l'anticipation  et   l'accompagnement  des  mutations  économiques.  Celleci  précise  notamment  les  rôles  joués  par  la  Datar  et  par  la  MIME  :  la  Datar  intervient  sur  le  pilotage  de  l'accompagnement  territorial.  Quant  à  la  MINE,  petite  équipe  pluridisciplinaire  composée  de  5  hauts-fonctionnaires  mis  à  disposition  par  les  ministères  de  l'Emploi,  du  Travail  et  de  la  Cohésion  sociale,  de  la  Défense,  de  l'Economie,  des  Finances  et  de  l'Industrie  et  de  l'Intérieur,  elle  est  animée  par  Jean-Pierre  Aubert  et  intervient  sur  la  cohérence  des  actions.  Manquait  donc  un  coup  d'accélérateur.  C'est  chose  faite  avec  le  lancement  d'un  appel  à  projets.  Après  examen  des  dossiers  par  la  Datar,  une  prochaine  réunion  du  CIADT,  vraisemblablement  dès  le  printemps  prochain,  arrêtera  une  première  liste  de  pôles  labellisés.  Le  gouvernement  va  débloquer  pour  cela  750  millions  d'euros  sur  trois  ans,  entre  2005  et  2007,  dont  370  millions  proviennent  du  budget  des  ministères  et  380  millions  des  établissements  publics  de  l'Etat.  A  savoir,  la  Caisse  des  dépôts  et  consignations,  l'Agence  française  de  l'innovation  (ANVAR),  la  Banque  de  développement  des  petites  et  moyennes  entreprises  (BDPME)  et  sa  filiale  Sofaris.  Ces  soutiens  financiers  pourraient   être  complétés  par  les  régions  et  les  fonds  européens,  dans  le  respect  de  la  règle  communautaire  du  cumul  des  aides.

"  SEEMS  JLIKE  OLD  TIMES   Russian  prosecutors  probe  Jewish  codex   LEV  KRICHEVSKY   MOSCOW  -  Russian  prosecutors  have  launched  a  preliminary  inves  tigation  into  a  Russian  Jewish  organisation  for  publishing  the  Shulchan  Aruch,  the  500-year-old  Jewish  text  which  still  serves  as  the  basic  legal  code  for  Judaism.   Two  weeks  ago,  Moscow  prose  cutors  declined  to  open  a  criminal  case  against  the  authors  of  a  letter  calling  on  Russian  authorities  to  ban  Jewish  religious  organisations  as  extremist.  Now,  prosecutors  have  said  they  intend  to  investigate  the  Congress  of  Jewish  Religious  Organisations  and  Communities  of  Russia  (KEROOR)  that  published  the  Shulchan  Aruch,  which  the  authors  of  the  antisemitic  letter  had  cited  as  evidence  for  their  claim.   The  events  are  motivating  Russ  ian  Jewish  groups  that  often  squab  ble  with  each  other  to  find  common  ground  in  opposing  the  prosecu   tors’  actions.   The  letter,  which  first  surfaced  in  January,  called  for  an  investigation   A  page  from  the  Shulchan  Aruch...  banned  in  Russia?  Photo:  Israeli  Government   into  the  activities  of  Jewish  religious  groups  in  Russia  that  work  accord  ing  to  “the  morals  of  [the]  Shulchan  Aruch”  that  the  letter  claims  con  tains  norms  that  are  “offensive  to  Orthodox  Christians”   Alleging  that  Jews  believe  in  “anti-Christian  morals”,  the  signa  tories  also  demanded  that  Jews  be  banned  from  employment  in  the   civil  service  and  in  the  media.   The  letter,  which  had  20  Duma  deputies  among  its  5000  signato  ries,  urged  a  criminal  prosecution  of  KEROOR,  which  published  a   Russian  translation  of  the  Kitzur   Shulchan  Aruch,  an  abridged  ver  sion  of  the  code,  in  1999.   The  news  that  the  prosecutors  are  investigating  a  Jewish  group  generated  a  front-page  report  in   one  of  Russia’s  national  dailies  last   week,  and  prompted  all  three  of  Russia’s  major  Jewish  groups  to  respond.  Izvestia  speculated  that  the  probe  may  result  in  a  criminal  charge  of  extremism  against   KEROOR.   Izvestia  also  ran  a  detailed  com   mentary  by  Pinchas  Goldschmidt,   Moscow’s  chief  rabbi  and  head  of  the  rabbinical  court  affiliated  with  KEROOR,  who  provided  his   remarks  on  the  passages  in  the  Shulchan  Aruch  that  seemed  to  most  irritate  those  who  penned  the  antisemitic  letter.  Among  the  pas  sages  is  a  prohibition  for  Jews  to  teach  non-Jews  any  crafts  or  for  Jewish  women  to  help  non-Jewish  women  during  childbirth.   Goldschmidt  explained  that  such  laws  and  prohibitions  originated  in  ancient  history  -  some  in  pre   Christian  times  more  than  2500   years  ago  -  and  referred  to  idol  wor  shippers,  not  to  Christians.   But  Goldschmidt  told  JTA  he  was  uncomfortable  providing  such  comments  to  the  newspaper.   “It’s  ironic  that  I’m  going  into  the  role  of  my  predecessor,  Rabbi  Yakov  Maze,”  Goldschmidt  said,  referring  to  the  Moscow  chief  rabbi  who  testified  on  matters  of  Jewish  law  during  the  Beilis  trial,  an  infa   mous  1913  blood  libel  case.   “The  issues  that  were  at  stake   during  the  Beilis  trial  back  then  came  back  to  haunt  Russia  today,”   Goldschmidt  said.

The  existing  Holocaust  museums  will  provide  a  powerful  tool  to  fight  racial   ideology  and  the  resulting  antisemitism.  In  Israel,  when  eventually  a  degree  of  peaceful  coexistence  will  be  achieved,  the  people   traumatised  by  past  acts  of  terror  will  give  priority  to  economical,  technological  and  scientific  development,  which  will  prevent  the  brain  drain  from  the  country.

Keep  up  the  good  work!  I  was  particularly  impressed  by  the  article  on  that  bunch  of  embarrasing  nutjobs  at  godhatesfags.com,  because  the  writer  condemned  their  hatred  and  hypocrisy  without  writing  off  all  of  Christianity  along  with  it.  This  is  in  stark  contrast  to  the  rabid,  blinkered,  christian-hating  fanatacism  of  Tharunka  in  days  gone  by.

"  Boat  Magic  -  the  true  tale   By  CMDR  Sharon  Daniels  RANR   There  have  been  a  few  requests  to  tell  the  true  tale  of  the  Boat  Magic  story,  and  many  newcomers  to  the  RAN  and  in  particular  Patrol  Boats  are  unaware  of  the  history  of  the  project.   So  here  is  Boat  Magic  ...  in  the  beginning.  At  the  turn  of  the  millennium,  CDRE  Gerry  Christian  (then  CAPT  Christian,  COMAUSNAVPBGRP)  and  I  had  a  conversation  about  what  makes  Patrol  Boats  ""hum  and  tick"".  He  being  a  people-person,  and  I  being  a  NR  Psych  ...  well  we  both  agreed  it  had  everything  to  do  with  the  people  on-board.  Being  a  Patrol  Boat  devotee,  1  urged  him  to  let  me  find  out  more  .  about  it  and  he  named  the  project  ""Boat  Magic"".  ...  CDRE  Christian's  main  thrust  was  the  then-  impending  Armidale  Patrol  Boat's  crewing  strat  egy  -  to  single-crew  or  not  to  single-crew?  I  was  keen  to  find  out  just  what  made  our  Patrol  Boats  ""hum  and  tick"",  just  what  did  provide  that  Boat  Magic?  So  in  2001  I  started  short  stints  as  a  sea-rider  and  asked  crewmembers  for  their  opin  ions;  To  get  some  comparative  views  about  other  '  crewing  strategies,  interviews  also  took  place  on  .  Multi-crewed  HS  ships,  and  Australian  Customs  National  Marine  Unit  Bay  Class  Patrol  Boats  .  (who  were  Ad  Hoc  crewed).  The  data  collected,  and  analysed  finally  appeared  in  the  Navy  Discussion  Paper  ""Hitman  .  Aspects  of  Alternative  Crewing  Strategies  for  ,  the  Replacement  Patrol  Boats:  A.  Psychological   Study"".  (A  copy  of  this  is  available  from  the  author.)  Navies  around  the  world  had  not  researched  this  area  and  were  seemingly  plucking  crewing  strategies  out  of  thin  air  in  response  to  decreasing  money  and  manning  sic,  and  more  sophisticated  machinery.  This  was  perhaps  a  not  very  shipshape  approach  to  the  problem.  The  complex  information  and  data  needed  more  scientific  rigour  and  method  -  most  of  which  I'd  forgotten  over  the  past  25  years  since  university  graduation.  '  I  realised  then,  this  was  an  awesome  challenge  for  me!  So  I  went  back  to  school  ...  land  enrolled  in  a  part-time  PhD.  This  gives  me  access  to  the  high-  level,  of  scientific  research  and  protocol  the  Boat  Magic  study  really  deserves.  My  learning  curve  escalated!  ...  '  ,  Reading  statistics  and  methodology  books  over  coffee  has  become  a  rigorous  part  of  my  ,  early  morning  routine.  The  Boat  Magic  project  and  my  PhD  run  in  parallel,  as  for  me  they  are  really  one  and  the  same.  How  rewarding  and  indulgent  it  is  to  be  a  student  again.  Of  course  being  a  PhD  student  is  a  two-way  street.  Just  as.  my  supervisors  have  a  respon  sibility  to  teach  me  .what  I  don't  know,  I  have  ;  a  responsibility  to  teach  them  about  our  Nayy  lingo,  practices  and  procedures  as  they  relate  to  Boat  Magic.  The  first  ,  item  on  the  agenda  was   what  is  a  crewing  strategy?  (Just  try  explaining  that  in  25  words  or  less!),  So  what  seemed  like  an  impossible  task  ended  being  the  Navy  Discussion  paper  titled  ""  Boat  Magic  -  Part  1:  History  of  alternative  crewing  strategies  published  in  2002.  (Copy  also  avail  able  from  the  author.)  By  2002,.  CAPT  Frank  Kresse  was  COMAUSNAVPBGRP.  He  enthusiastically  pro  vided  Boat  Magic  with  the  logistics  to  vanquish  mountainous  waves  of  internal  paperwork  and  protocol.  During  this  period  CAPT  Kresse  established  the  multi-crewing  regime  for  the  Armidale  Class  Patrol  Boats  (i.e.,  18  crews  for  12  boats  and  the  associated  crew  management  concept),  and  conditions  of  service  developed  to  maximise  the  operational  capability.  The  Boat  Magic  project  supports  the  future  generation  of  crews  and  helps  the  FEG  to  learn  more  about  the  value  and  work  ings  of  what  has  been  implemented.  So  from  the  beginning,  what  have  I  learned  so  far  about  Boat  Magic?  Well  firstly  crewing  strat  egy  can  be  broken  down  into  two  main  functions:  .  how  much  time  is  spent  with  the  same  crew  and  how  much  time  is  spent  with  the  same  vessel.  .  Secondly,  the  psychological  factors  of  cohe  sion,  psychological  ownership  of  vessel,  leader  ship,  and  corporate  knowledge  may  be  affected  by  how  much  time  people  spend  together  and  with  their  boat.  -   Thirdly  and  finally,  Boat  Magic  is  measurabls  in  terms  of  crew,  performance  (i.e.,  readiness  anc  psychological  well-being).  So  then  crewing  strat  egy  makes  a  difference  to  Boat  Magic.  Now  much  of  this  may  sound  like  basic  com'  mon  sense  to  many  Navy  readers,  and  experi  enced  mariners  who  know  this  intuitively  maj  say  ""I  know  this  —  tell  me  something  I  don'  know"".  Yet  common  sense  does  not  always  share  in  the  complexities  of  decision  making  for  varf  ous  logistical,  financial  and  socio-political  rea  sons.  Common  sense  needs  facts,  figures,  statistics  and  generally  strict  scientific  evidence  to  sup  port  it!  The  Boat  Magic  project  is  designed  to  dc  -  this  by  finding  out  the  why,  how,  and  what  make  Patrol  Boats  hum  and  tick,  under  different  crew'  ing  strategies.  Meanwhile,  the  project  steams  ahead  inte  unchartered  waters,  deciphering  crewing  strate  gies,  and  navigating  the  human  psychologica  factors  that  converge  on  Boat  Magic.  There  .  has  been  more  data  collected  and  results  to  report  tc  you,  but  more  of  that  next  time.

"  principal  and  African  prince   ORYANA  KAUFMAN   NATI  Gamedze's  grandfather   was  the  king  of  Swaziland.  Giving  up  his  royal  heritage  to  become  a  rabbi  was  no  easy  feat  for  this  African  prince.   Rabbi  Gamedze  was  in  Sydney  last  week  as  a  guest  of  the  Jewish  Learning  Centre  recounting  his  unique  path  to  Judaism  and  Israel.   ""The  last  king  from  our  family  was  my  father's  father.  This  was  during  a  time  when  the  Christian  missionaries  started  coming  into  the  country.  My  grandfather  declined  the  throne  and  pursued  Christianity,""  Rabbi  Gamedze  told  an  audience  of  stu  dents  at  Moriah  College.   Two  generations  later,  his  grand  son  also  took  a  left  turn  -  and  found  Judaism.   ""The  biggest  gift  I  have  today  is  being  Jewish,""  said  Rabbi  Gamedze.   The  Swazi  prince  stumbled  upon  Judaism  while  a  student  at  the  University  of  Witwatersrand  in  South  Africa,  he  said.   ""One  day  I  was  sitting  in  an  Italian  literature  class  and  I  looked  at  the  person  sitting  to  my  right.  I  saw  him  writing  in  script  from  right  to  left;  he  said  he  was  doing  Hebrew  and  I  thought,  I  want  to  learn  that  too,""  said  Rabbi  Gamedze,  who  speaks  13  languages.   He  quickly  signed  up  for  a  Hebrew  class  becoming  ""the  only  black  person  to  be  studying  it  at  the  university"".   ""When  I  was  studying  at  Wits  [University  of  Witwatersrand]  in  Johannesburg  during  apartheid  any  socialising  across  the  colour  line  was  not  something  that  was  advocated  in  society  at  the  time.  But  I  had  a  num  ber  of  Jewish  friends.   ""They  had  their  own  idea  of  what  was  moral.  Even  in  the  days  when  it  was  forbidden  for  black  and  white  people  to  mix,  many  of  them  opened  up  their  homes,""  he  said.   “One  day  I  was  sitting  in   an  Italian  literature  ’  class  and  I  looked  at   the  person  sitting  to  my  right.  I  saw  him  writing  in  script  from  right  to  left;  he  said  he  was  doing  Hebrew  and  I   thought,  I  want  to  learn  that  too.”   RABBI  NAD  GAMEDZE   In  a  surprise  turn  of  events,  Rabbi  Gamedze  found  that  one  of  his  col  leagues  and  fellow  Hebrew  student  at  the  time  was  Moriah  College  prin  cipal  Roy  Steinman.  The  pair  had  not  seen  each  other,  nor  talked,  since  their  days  as  students  in  Johannesburg.   Rabbi  Natl  Gamedze   (left)  with  Moriah  College  principal  Roy  Steinman...  they  had   not  seen  each  other   since  they  studied  Hebrew  together  in  :  ;  apartheid  South   Africa.   Rabbi  Gamedze  went  on  to  com  plete  a  master's  degree  in  Hebrew  and  was  then  awarded  a  scholarship  to  study  at  the  Hebrew  University  in  Jerusalem.  He  quickly  found  himself   drawn  to  Judaism.   ""I  felt  it  was  speaking  to  me  in  a  very  personal  way;  telling  me  of  the  personal  agenda  of  what  was  going  on.  I  said  to  myself  I  had  to  find  out  what  all  this  meant,""  he  said.   Three  years  later,  he  converted  and  now  he  spends  his  time  studying  and  teaching  Torah  in  the  northern  Israeli  town  of  Tsfat,  where  he  lives.   But  Rabbi  Gamedze  does  not  deny   that  his  choices  have  come  at  a  price.   ""I  come  from  a  pretty  Christian  home;  it  certainly  wasn't  easy.   ""There  is  a  very  high  emotional  price  to  pay.  Everyone  is  attached  to  their  biological  family  and-totally  removing  oneself  from  their  loved  ones  can  be  a  very  lonely  road,""  he   said.   But  Rabbi  Gamedze's  family  even  tually  came  to  accept  his  life  choices.   ""My  family  know,  after  all  these  years,  that  I  am  pursuing  something  I  believe  is  truth.  But  my  concept  of  life  is  very  different  than  theirs,""  he  said. ",2005-09-30
"  Image  of  the  Jewish  mother  under  scrutiny   BOOK  REVIEW   DEBORAH  STONE   MOTHERS  AND  CHILDREN:   JEWISH  FAMILY  LIFE  IN  MEDIEVAL  EUROPE   Elisheva  Baumgarten   Princeton  University  Press,  $45   TWO  contradictory  mythologies  dominate  popular  thinking  about  the  Jewish  mothers  of  the  past.   Frequently  they  are  painted  with  Madonna-like  perfection,  historical   “women  of  valour”  sublimated  to  the  needs  of  others.   Alternatively,  they  are  a  combina  tion  of  Golda  from  Fiddler  on  the  Roof   and  Woody  Allen’s  neurotic  all-know  ing  nemesis  in  Oedipus  Wrecks,  exhausted  and  exhausting.   Neither  image  is  based  on  any  thing  more  than  folklore,  but  perhaps  that  is  not  surprising.  Until  now  Jew  ish  motherhood  has  been  a  subject  for  jokes  or  moralising,  but  not  for  serious  scholarship.   Elisheva  Baumgarten  brings  a  scholar’s  craft  to  the  fascinating  sub  ject  of  mothers  and  children,  examin  ing  the  family  roles  and  relationships  of  Jews  in  medieval  Europe.   She  is  a  patient,  detailed  writer  who  makes  modest  claims  and  backs   them  up  with  plenty  of  carefully-sift   ed  evidence.   The  considerable  life  in  her  pages  derives  not  from  especially  lively  writ  ing  (though  she  is  not  dull)  but  from  an  ability  to  capture  and  transmit  the  essence  of  her  primary  sources.   Baumgarten  is  not  pushing  an  ide  ological  barrow.  She  wants  to  know  how  women,  and  by  implication  all  Jewish  people,  lived  during  this  period.   Because  her  sphere  of  study  is  the  private  world,  she  does  not  have  the  usual  wealth  of  subject-specific  docu  ments  to  rely  on.   This  turns  out  to  be  a  blessing  because  she  casts  her  net  widely  and  trawls  in  a  remarkable  quantity  of  evidence  from  both  Jewish  and  Chris  tian  sources.   Baumgarten  writes  of  “our  ability   to  hear  women’s  voices,  voices  one  has  to  pry  out  of  the  male  rabbinic  narrative”,  noting  that  this  is  easier  to  do  at  sites  of  tension,  for  example  between  female  midwives  and  male  circumcisers.   Her  detailed  study  reveals  telling  parallels  between  Jewish  and  Christ  ian  experience,  a  field  that  is  often  not  explored  by  scholars  more  interested  in  differentiation  than  in  discovery.   I  Until  now  Jewish   motherhood  has  been  a  subject  for  jokes  or   moralising,  but  not  for  serious  scholarship.   Baumgarten,  a  lecturer  in  Jewish  history  and  gender  studies  at  Bar-Uan  University  in  Israel,  has  produced  this  book  for  a  Princeton  University  Press  series  on  Jews,  Christians  and  Mus  lims  from  the  ancient  to  the  modem  world.   Her  accomplished  contribution  does  something  to  advance  the  cause  of  the  series  because  it  creates  links  between  the  developing  cultures  based  on  a  genuine  appreciation  of  the  way  proximity  to  each  other  informed  and  changed  their  practices.

Extraordinarily  the  practice  appears  to  have  arisen  from  supersti  tions  about  a  Germanic  goddess  Frau  Holle  who  was  believed  to  kidnap  unbaptised  baby  boys.   By  loudly  naming  their  child  with  a  non-Jewish  name,  the  Jews  apparently   hoped  to  protect  the  child,  tricking  the  witch  into  thinking  the  child  had  been  baptised.  What  a  remarkable  example  of  cultural  melding!   Baumgarten  moves  from  fertility  through  birth  and  nursing  practices,  subjects  which  are  treated  in  great   detail.

"  GLOBAL  SOTETL   FROM  THE  JEWISH  PRESS   REBBE7ZIN  STRAW?   LONDON  -  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  was  nicknamed  “Jew""  at  school  -  despite  the  fact  that  he  isn't  Jewish.  Because  his  initials  are  JWS,  they  lent  themselves  to  the  jocular  taunts  of  school  pals  at  Brentwood  School  in  Essex,  his  mother  has  revealed.   “He’s  also  always  looked  Jewish,”  she   said.   Joan  Ormston-Straw,  a  spritely  84  year  old  whose  paternal  grandfather  was  a  Ger  man  Jew,  spoke  about  her  Jewish  origins  to  the  UK's  Jewish  Telegraph  this  week.  She  said  that  Jack,  when  he  was  12,  bought  her  a  book  called  How  to  be  a  Jewish  Mother.   “When  I  asked  him  why,  he  replied,  ‘Because  you  are.’   “I  am  a  quarter  Jewish,  but  I’ve  been  brought  up  a  Christian  and  stayed  that  way;’  she  said.  But  three  years  ago  Mrs  Straw,  of  Loughton,  Essex,  nearly  made  a  dramatic  return  to  her  religious  roots.   She  was  taken  by  her  close  friend,  the  veteran  communal  leader  Sir  Sigmund  Sternberg,  to  see  the  Sternberg  Foundation  and  decided  that  she  wanted  to  become  a   rabbi.  “I  thought,  if  I’d  been  younger,  I’d  have  gone  for  it” ",2005-11-11
"  Religious  leaders  join  forces  to  ban  Jerusalem  gay  parade   ETGAR  LEFKOVITS  reports  on  a  rare  alliance  of  religious  leaders  in  Jerusalem.   “We  have  enough  '   tension  in  our  city  regarding  the   disengagement  plan   and  we  do  not  need  to  add  oil  to  the  fire.”   RABBI  SHLOMOAMAR   Israel’s  chief  rabbi   ENIOR  religious  leaders  of  Judaism,  Christianity  and  Islam  in  the  Holy  Land  joined  forces  last  week  to   thwart  a  major  international  gay   parade  scheduled  to  take  place  in  Jerusalem  in  August,  urging  the  gov  ernment  to  ban  the  event  which  they  said  could  provoke  a  violent  reaction   from  the  faithful.   A  declaration  signed  by  a  dozen  top  religious  leaders  including  Israel’s  chief  rabbis,  the  Latin  patriarch,  the  Vatican  ambassador  to  the  Holy  Land,  representatives  of  the  Armenian  and  Greek  Orthodox  patriarchies  and  three  Muslim  sheiks  expressed  shock  at  “notice  that  a  worldwide  assembly  of  10  days  including  an  immodest  parade  devoid  of  minimal  propriety  is  scheduled  to  be  held  in  Jerusalem  this  summer,  which  will  offend  the  very  foundations  of  our  religious  values  and  the  character  of  the  Holy  City.  Such  an  event  would  constitute  a  severe  affront  to  the  hearts  and  souls  of  adherents  of  all  religions  -  Jews,  Christians  and  Muslims  alike.   “We  call  upon  and  demand  ...  the  Israeli  Government  and  all  responsi  ble  officials  to  realise  the  full  implica  tions  of  their  plans  and  to  prohibit  any  march  of  this  kind,  and  especially  in  the  Holy  City  of  Jerusalem.”   United  and  uncompromising  in  their  beliefs,  speaker  after  speaker  in  the  multi-faith  trilingual  press  conference  organised  by  the  Israeli  Chief  Rab  binate  denounced  the  planned  event  as  an  affront  and  provocation  to  the  sen  sitivities  of  Jerusalem’s  Jewish,  Arab  and  Christian  residents,  as  well  as  to  millions  of  believers  around  the  world.   “We  have  enough  tension  in  our  city  regarding  the  disengagement  plan   and  we  do  not  need  to  add  oil  to  the  fire,”  Chief  Rabbi  Shlomo  Amar  said.   Latin  Patriarch  Michel  Sabbah  concurred:  “The  particular  holiness  of  Jerusalem  has  requirements  both  for  those  who  are  believers  and  those  who  are  not.”   The  representative  of  the  Holy  See,  Archbishop  Pietro  Sambi,  said:  “We  respect  the  ideas  of  everybody,  but  everybody  must  respect  the  senti  ments  of  the  inhabitants  of  Jerusalem.   “Such  a  parade  is  not  only  an  offence  but  a  provocation  to  Jews,  Christians  and  Muslims  all  over  the  world.”  He  added:  “No-one  can  be  sure  such  a  move  will  not  provoke  a   reaction  from  the  faithful.”   New  York  Rabbi  Yehuda  Levin,   representing  1000  Orthodox  rabbis   from  the  Rabbinical  Alliance  of  America,  who  has  been  actively  work  ing  with  evangelical  Christian  leaders  in  the  US  against  the  event,  lambasted  the  “parade  of  abomination”  which  he  said  represented  nothing  less  than  “a  spiritual  rape”  of  the  Holy  Land.   “Why  is  it  that  the  government  of  Israel  does  not  allow  10,000  Jews  to  march  on  the  Temple  Mount  because  it  is  said  to  be  a  provocation,  but  does  not  stop  a  10-day  immoral  celebra  tion  of  sodomy  and  pornography  which  is  a  provocation  to  the  over  whelming  majority  of  the  people  of  this  city,  and  this  land?”  he  asked.   The  highly  unusual  co-operation  between  Jerusalem’s  top  religious  lead  ers  comes  on  the  heels  of  a  joint  Chris  tian-Jewish  campaign  launched  in  the  city  earlier  this  month  to  prevent  the   Latin  Patriarch  Michel  Sabah  (left)  is  greeted  by  Sephardi  Chief  Rabbi  Shlomo   Amar  while  in  the  background  Ashkenazi  Chief  Rabbi  Shlomo  Metzger  (right)  talks   to  Patriarch  Turkum  Monojohn.

The  press  conference  where  black  hatted  rabbis  intermingled  with  black-hooded  priests;  Hebrew  speaking  priests  pressed  hands  with  Hebrew-speaking  sheikhs;  and  Mus   lim  clerics  warned  of  destructions   along  the  lines  of  Sodom  and  Gomorra,  was  condemned  by  Israel’s  Masorti  (Conservative)  movement,  which  has  come  out  strongly  in  favour  of  the  international  gay-pride   event.   Masorti  spokesman  Rabbi  David  Lazar  said:  “Such  an  unholy  coalition  of  people  who  otherwise  hate  each  other  only  represents  their  own  fear  and  hatred  of  the  gay  and  lesbian  community.”   As  the  debate  rages,  police  were  “considering”  asking  organisers  to  postpone  the  event  since  their  forces   will  be  overburdened  with  the  con  comitant  withdrawal  from  Gaza.   The  prerogative  for  issuing  permits  for  marches  and  other  public  events  in  the  country  rests  with  the  police.   For  their  part,  local  organisers  of  the  event  have  said  that  they  had  not  received  any  request  from  police  to  postpone  the  10-day  event.   “Every  year  there  is  another  excuse   why  this  is  not  the  right  time,  said  Hagai  El-Ad,  the  executive  director  of  Jerusalem’s  Gay  and  Lesbian  Centre,  whose  organisation  is  planning  to   host  the  international  event.   In  a  largely-conservative  city,  with  a  strong  religious  and  traditional  make  up,  the  idea  of  holding  such  an  inter  national  parade  in  Jerusalem  is  seen  by  many-  even  outside  of  religious  circles   -  as  out  of  touch  with  both  the   spiritual  character  of  the  city  as  well  as   the  sensitivities  of  its  observant  residents.   A  poll  released  at  the  Jerusalem  press  conference  indicated  that  three  quarters  of  Jerusalem’s  Jewish  resi  dents  were  opposed  to  the  event.   The  Dahaif  Institute  poll  taken  this  month  among  400  people  found  that  among  Jerusalem  Arabs  96  per  cent  opposed  the  event.  In  response  to  the  poll,  organisers  of  the  parade  said  that  “freedom  of  speech  should  not  be  held  hostage  to  one  poll  or  another”.   The  last  international  gay  parade,  which  took  place  in  Rome  in  2000  despite  the  wrath  of  the  Vatican,  attracted  about  half-a-million  partic  ipants.  Organisers  of  this  year’s  event  are  expecting  tens  of  thousands  of   revellers.   JERUSALEM  POST   i ",2005-04-08
"  Music   Why  do  you  think  so  many  so-called  indie  bands  such  Spoon  have  cracked  the  mainstream  in  the  last  couple  of  years?  Well,  'cos  we're  better  than  anyone  else...  People  who  care  about  music  tend  to  care  about  the  way  it  comes  out.  They  wanna  be  able  to  do  it  for  a  while.  They  look  at  the  bigwig  playing  field  at  this  point  and  it  doesn't  really  seem  to  be  a  thing  that  promotes  good  music  or  long-term  careers  or  even  being  able  to  make  that  second  or  third  record.  I  think   that  probably  people  overall  have  looked  at  that  and  said  'I  wanna  work  with  a  label  that  understands  me.'  That  hap  pens  more  to  people  who  give  a  shit  about  music  than  it  does  to  people  who  are  in  it  to,  like,  become  popular.  Be  cause  of  that  they  get  better  music  on  independent  labels  Your  home  state  of  Texas  has  received  a  battering  lately  by  musicians  such  as  Conor  Oberst  because  it's  also  the  birthplace  of  George  W  Bush  [Oberst  an-  nounced  at  a  Texas  gig:  'I'd  put  a  fucking  gun  to  my  head  before  I'd  live  in  your  state'  ].  How  do  you  fell  about  this?  Well,  I'm  friends  with  Conor  and  I  was  surprised  when  he  said  that  (laughs).  I  think  he  just  drinks  a  lot.  When  he  drinks  a  lot  he's  got  a  mouth  on  him...l  don't  know,  its  hard  being  in  Texas.  Austin  is  the  one  place  in  Texas  where  I'd  wanna  live  cos  the  rest  of  it  is  extremely  conservative  and  not  very  cultured...l  mean,  I'm  okay  with  what  Conor  said  (laughs)  but  I  wonder  if  he  regretted  it  the  next  day.  The  focus  topic  for  this  issue  is  faith.  Do  you  have  a  religious  faith  or  anything  like  that?  Yeah,  I'm  a  Christian.  That's  how  I  was  raised.  Is  that  to  do  with  the  Texas  upbringing?  I  guess  so.  It's  not  just  a  Texas  thing,  it's  America.  It's  a  very  religious  country...  Does  Christianity  guide  your  life  in  any  particular  di  rection?  To  be  good.

Even  though  the  album  is  called  Gimme  Fiction  are  any  of  the  songs  based  on  fact?  A  lot  of  them  are  sort  of  based  on  things  that  happened  but  the  two  that  stand  out  on  there  to  me  as  being  more  sort  of  personal,  actually  kind  of  emotional  and  real  are  'I  Summon  You'  and  They  Never  Got  You'.  ..[They  Never  Got  You'  is  about]  growing  up  in  Texas.  I  mean  it  could  have  happened  anywhere  but  it's  about  growing  up,  being  lonely  as  fuck  and  not  having  anybody  to  connect  to.  What  fiction  is  floating  your  boat  at  the  moment?  Right  now  I'm  reading  a  lot  of  non-fiction,  that's  usually  what  I  read.  I'm  reading  the  autobiography  of  Motley  Crue  right  now...  Have  you  caught  them  on  their  reunion  tour?  I've  never  seen  them  live  but  the  book  is  pretty  fun  to  read.

"  Editorial   Faith  is  what  gets  a  lot  of  people  through  their  days;  whether  it  be  religious  belief  or,  like  Hume,  trust  in  everyday  continuity.  Something  that  makes  the  issue  of  faith  interesting  is  when  beliefs  are  presented  with  a  challenge.  With  the  advent  of  hurricane  Katrina,  many  Southerners  have  come  to  question  their  faith.  Undoubtedly  this  has  been  in  a  personal  and  Christian  sense  for  many,  but  it  has  also  affected  the  hurricane  victims  in  a  broader  nation  al  sense.  Many  American  citizens  and  commentators  have  been  quick  to  criticise  the  President  and  Executive  for  not  reacting  sooner  -  and  perhaps  rightly  so.  It  is  perplexing  that  a  Government  so  wealthy,  and  which  identi  fies  its  culture  with  strength  and  might,  could  be  so  incredibly  unprepared  for  such  predictable  devastation.  But  rather  than  focus  on  the  obvious  loss  of   faith  in  the  Bush  Administration,  there  has  perhaps  been  a  wider  disillusion  ment  with  the  nation's  culture.  The  hurricane  has  reminded  America  that  it  is  not  an  invincible  power,  and  that  unfortunately,  many  poor  (read:  black)  Americans  are  more  vulnerable  to  loss  of  liberty  and  justice  than  their  fellow  patriots.  We  thought  'faith'  would  be  an  interesting,  albeit  controversial,  topic  to  ex  plore  in  our  second-last  Woroni  (that's  right,  second-last  Woroni).  So  please  enjoy,  and  we'll  see  you  on  the  mighty  seas  next  time  -  arrrgh!  Love,  trust  and  cuddly  things,  Lucy  and  Chloe.  W  « ",2005-09-01

"  OFFENSIVE  ABSOLUTION   I  READ  with  interest  your  editorial  (AJN  21/10)  entitled  “Jewish-Catholic  relations:  40  years  after  Nostra  Aetata.  I  particularly  noticed  two  sentences,   one  stating  that  Pope  Paul  VI  “absolved  the  Jewish  people  of  the  charge  of  killing  Jesus”  and  the  other  that  “the  charge  of  deicide  of  which  the  Jews  stood  (falsely)  accused  was  erased  by  this  historic  document”.   I  found  it  offensive  to  read  that  the  Jewish  people  needed  to  be  absolved  of  something  we  did  not  do  and  won  dered  if  it  were  just  the  journalistic  prose  used  by  the  writer.  Nostra  Aetate  states  that  “it  was  true  that  the  Jewish  authorities  and  those  that  followed   their  lead  pressed  for  Jesus’  death,  yet  what  happened  in  Christ’s  passion  cannot  be  charged  against  all  the  Jews  without  distinction  then  alive  nor  against  the  Jews  of  today.”   This  seems  to  me  to  be  inferring  that  the  Jewish  people  actually  were  responsible  or  at  least  implicit  in  put  ting  Jesus  to  death,  yet  they  have  been  “forgiven”  by  the  Catholic  Church.   I  accept  progress  has  been  made  in  Jewish/Christian  dialogue  over  the  past  few  years  but  perhaps  it  is  the  Jew  ish  people  who  should  “absolve”  the  Catholic  Church  for  2000  years  of  per  secution  and  blame  before  it  finally  spoke  out  against  antisemitism.

"  Gibson  behind  Holocaust  series   NATHAN  BURSTEIN   A  PRODUCTION  company  owned  by  Mel  Gibson  is  developing  a  TV  minis   eries  about  the  Holocaust.   Con  Artists  Productions,  Gibson’s  television  production  company,  has  been  contracted  by  the  American  TV  network  ABC  to  produce  the  miniseries,  although  Gibson’s  role  in  the  project  is  not  yet  clear.   One  of  Hollywood’s  most  bankable  stars  over  the  past  two  decades,  Gibson  ignited  controversy  last  year  with  The   Passion  of  the  Christ,  a  film  some  critics  and  Jewish  groups  accused  of  promot  ing  antisemitic  interpretations  of  Jesus’   crucifixion.   The  controversy  helped  launch  the   film  to  massive  box-office  success.   The  new  miniseries  will  be  set  around  the  story  of  Flory  van  Beek,  a  Dutch  Jew  who  spent  the  Holocaust  in  hiding,  but  lost  family  members  in  the  Nazi  camps.   After  surviving  the  sinking  of  a  pas  senger  liner  torpedoed  by  a  German   submarine,  Van  Beek  and  her  husband  returned  to  Holland,  where  they  spent  three  years  in  hiding  with  the  help  of   three  Christian  families.   The  miniseries  will  be  based  on  Van   Beek’s  1998  memoir  Flory:  Survival  in  the  Valley  of  Death.   It  was  first  suggested  to  the  network  by  Daniel  Sladek,  an  independent  pro  ducer  whose  Jewish  father  spent  World  War  II  in  hiding  in  Slovakia  and  later  became  a  personal  friend  of  Van  Beek   and  her  husband.

"  NON-KOSHER  CONDOMS   RABBI  Eli  Feldman  is  quite  correct  to  state  (AJN  9/9)  that  condoms  are  “completely  prohibited  by  halacha”  However,  there  are  also  at  least  three   weighty,  pragmatic  reasons  why  the  idea  to  promote  Israel  through  free   condoms  is  a  foolish  and  unbeliev  ably-irresponsible  one.   •  The  Christian  and  Muslim  stu   dent  bodies  will  accuse  Jews  of  ped  dling  immorality  -  this  is  the  last  thing  the  Jewish  community  needs  as  it  could  stir  up  serious  antisemitism  on   campus;   •  Marshall  McLuhan  coined  an  unforgettable  phrase  in  the  ‘60s:  “The  medium  is  the  message”  One  might  say  that  here  the  medium  has  totally  overshadowed  the  message.  No-one  will  be  talking  of  going  to  Israel  or  sup  porting  Israel.  Everybody  is  talking   instead  about  the  condoms.   ®  More  than  this,  the  subliminal  message  beamed  out  by  the  distribu  tion  of  condoms  is  in  direct  opposi  tion  to  the  message  AUJS  wishes  to  convey  regarding  Israel.   The  message  of  the  condoms  is  “be  safe  -  don’t  take  risks!”  Receivers  of  this  message  will,  albeit  subconscious  ly,  apply  it  to  Israel,  which  the  media  regularly  portrays  as  a  dangerous  trou   ble-spot.  Will  they  then  wish  to  take  the  “risk”  of  travelling  to  Israel  or  encourage  others  to  take  such  “risks”?   Anyone  in  advertising  will  aver  that  the  message  conveyed  in  a  PR  cam  paign  must  be  unambiguous.

"  CHRISTIAN  SUPPORT   I’M  a  concerned  Christian  who  would   like  to  say  that  I  support  Israel,  and  pray  that  God’s  will  be  done  in  the   Middle  East.   I  believe  the  Bible  when  it  says  that  Israel  will  go  through  a  time  of  great   trouble  as  the  end  of  the  world  as  we  know  it  draws  near.   I  also  believe  that  God  has  a  plan  for  the  State  of  Israel,  and  that  He  has  promised  the  state  will  survive  this  great  trouble.   I  hope  and  pray  that  this  letter  may  be  an  encouragement  to  those  who  read  it,  and  you  can  be  assured  of  the  support  and  prayer  of  a  great  number   of  Christian  believers  all  around  the   world.

"  ON  CHRISTIAN  ZIONISM   THE  negative  opinions  about  Christ  ian  Zionism  voiced  recently  by  certain  church  leaders  in  Jerusalem  (“The  Jerusalem  Declaration  on  Christian  Zionism”)  contain  inflammatory  lan  guage  and  unsupported  views  that  adhere  solely  to  the  Palestinian  narra  tive  of  the  Middle  East  conflict,  and  are  sadly  far  from  the  truth.   Christian  Zionism  is  a  theological  position  that  clearly  sees  a  future  des  tiny  for  Israel  in  the  land  of  her  forefa  thers.  We  reject  replacement  theology,  a  view  subscribed  to  by  Latin  Patri  arch  Michel  Sabbah,  which  teaches  that  God  has  rejected  Israel  and  replaced  her  with  the  Christian  church.  This  theory  played  a  pivotal  role  in  the  persecution  of  Jews  through  the  centuries,  including  the  original  blood  libel,  and  undergirded   the  Holocaust.   As  the  Australian  leaders  of  Christ   ian  Zionist  organisations,  we  take  a  firm  stand  against  this  unbiblical  the  ology.  We  believe  that  God,  by  a  sover  eign  choice,  gave  the  Land  of  Canaan  as  an  everlasting  possession  to  the  Jewish  people,  for  His  kingdom  pur  poses  (Genesis  17:7-8).  While  God  loves  all  people  equally,  He  has  chosen  the  Jewish  people  to  bring  redemption   to  mankind.   We  call  upon  Christians  and  churches  everywhere  not  to  remain   silent,  but  to  break  their  silence  and  speak  for  reconciliation  with  justice  in  the  Holy  Land,  to  pray  for  the  peace  of  Jerusalem,  and  to  affirm  Israel’s  right  to  live  in  peace  and  security,  free  from  the  threat  of  liquidation  by  Islamic  jihadists  who  clearly  seek  to  “colonise”  the  Jewish  State  by  bringing  it  into  an   Islamic  empire.

SACRAMENTS;  An  Anglican  View.""Aim:  To  investigate,  what  the  Anglican  Church  teaches  about  Sacraments.  1.  What  do  Anglicans  believe  about  sacraments?  Anglican  teaching  about  sacraments  is  found  in  two  places  in  particular.  The  first  is  in  the  39  Articles  of  religion  of  1662.  The  second  is  in  the  Catechism,  or  the  statement  of  belief  of  the  church.  The  Catechism  used  is  from  the  American  Anglican  Church.  We  could  ha\e  used  the  Australian,  Hnglish,  Japanese  or  French  tonus.  They  all  teach  the  same  things.  The  Anglican  Church  is  a  communion  of  churches  throughout  the  world.  They  are  united  in  belief,  although  they  do  vary  in  the  way  they  practice  their  religion.  2.  The  Articles  of  Religion  These  are  found  in  the  back  of  almost  every  Anglican  Prayer  Book.  Article  XXV  talks  about  sacraments.  Here  is  a  more  modem  \  ersion  from  the  Episcopal  Church  of  the  USA.  The  sacraments  given  by  Christ  are  badges  or  tokens  of  a  Christian's  declaration  of  faith.  They  are  sure  witnesses  of  God's  grace  and  good  will  towards  us.  They  are  also  working  signs  of  his  grace  and  good  will.  Through  the  sacraments  he  works  invisibly  within  us.  •  bringing  life  and  •  strengthening  and  •  confirming  our  faith  in  him.  There  are  two  sacraments  set  up  by  Christ  our  Lord  In  the  Gospel  Baptism  and  the  1  ord's  Supper.  3  An  Outline  of  the  Faith  (commonly  tailed  the  Catechism  -  from  the  Hook  of  Common  Prayer  of  the  American  Anglican  Church,  page  S4\   The  Sacraments  •  forgives  our  sins,  •  enlightens  our  minds,  •  stirs  our  hearts,  aid  *  strengthens  our  wills.

"  ABORTION  A  ‘JEWISH  PLOT  FOR  CHRISTIAN  GENOCIDE*   Catholic  priest  expels   evangelists  from  parish   LEW  LANDSMAN   A  USMORE  priest  has  expelled  from  his  parish  a  radical  group  of  Catholic  evangelists  who  claim  that  abortion  is  a  Jewish  plot  for  Christian  genocide.   Father  Dennis  Carroll,  of  St  Carthage’s  Cathedral,  last  week  dis  tanced  his  parish  from  the  Apostles  for  Life,  after  he  was  referred  to  the  group’s  website  by  concerned  mem  bers  of  the  Jewish  community.   “When  it  was  bought  to  my  atten  tion  that  the  group  was  involved  in  dubious  activities  and  were  also  anti  semitic,  I  took  the  action  of  publicly  discontinuing  them  and  ending  their  status  as  a  parish  group,”  Father  Car   roll  said.   He  also  told  his  parishioners  in  his   bulletin  to  be  “wary  of  the  anti-Jewish  views  expressed”  on  the  group’s  web   site.   Julie  Nathan,  co-chair  of  Rainbow  Kehilah,  the  Northern  Rivers  Jewish  Community  and  a  member  of  the  B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Com  mission  (ADC),  originally  came  across  the  website  while  researching.   She  contacted  ADC  chair  Dr  Paul  Gardner  and  David  Schutz  from  the  Inter-Faith  and  Ecumenical  Com  mission,  who  then  contacted  Father  Carroll.   Nathan  then  made  her  own  repre   sentation  to  Father  Carroll.  “I  came  to   Father  Carroll  with  16  pages  from  the  website  and  once  he  went  through  the  material,  he  realised  the  severity  of  the   anti-Jewish  hatred  of  the  group.”   ADC’s  executive  officer,  Manny  Waks,  commended  the  immediate  response.   “The  swift  action  taken  by  the  Catholic  community  in  dealing  with  the  issue  was  mostly  due  to  the  ongo  ing  inter-faith  relationship  that  has  been  developing  between  our  com   munities.”   He  said  action  would  be  taken  by  the  ADC  against  those  behind  the  website.  “We  will  ensure  that  the  out  rageous  and  conspiratorial  comments  on  this  website  are  removed,”  Waks  said.   Apostles  for  Life  is  run  by  a  Lismore  couple,  Angela  and  Nadir  Martello,  who  Nathan  says  are  known  for  their  “fundamentalist  and  extremist  views”.   The  website  features  an  article  by  Joanna  Francis,  who  claims  that  abor  tion  on  demand  “for  American  Jews  sig  nified  the  beginning  of  their  messianic  age,  wherein  they  could  now  freely  prac  tise  genocide  against  their  enemies,  the  Christians,  with  impunity”.   Francis  has  written  several  other   articles,  where  she  asserts  that  Pope  Benedict  XVI  is  a  Zionist  double  agent  and  that  Israeli  snipers  are  killing  US  soldiers  in  Iraq.   Although  Angela  Martello  told  the  Northern  Star  she  was  disturbed  by  Francis’  views  appearing  on  her  web  site,  she  later  admitted  that  “there’s  a  strong  possibility”  of  the  link  between  Judaism,  abortion  and  genocide.   Jeremy  Jones,  director  of  commu  nity  aflairs  of  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish   Aflkirs  Council,  told  the  AJN  that  “it  is  obviously  a  concern  that  this  can  hap  pen  but  we  have  to  commend  the   actions  of  the  mainstream  church  in   making  it  abundantly  dear  that  they   want  nothing  to  do  with  antisemitic  rat-bagger/’.   Father  Carroll  said  he  would  be  ‘Very  disappointed  if  there  were  still  people  [from  the  parish]  involved”  with  the  group.   “I  feel  that  I’ve  done  what  I  can  to  distance  us  from  such  evil  and  crazy  things.  Antisemitism  has  been  an  absolutely  horrible  feature  of  Chris  tianity;  it's  not  a  matter  of  our  reli  gion,  it’s  a  matter  of  our  human  frailty.  We  need  to  combat  it”   There  is  an  estimated  Jewish  popu  lation  of  1000  people,  including  many  Israeli  travellers,  in  the  northern  NSW,  especially  Byron  Bay. ",2006-12-01
"  JEWISH  REFLECTIONS  ON  A  POST-CHRISTIAN  AUSTRALIA   In  post-modern  21st-century  Australia,  Jews,  Christians  and  Muslims  may  have  much  more  in  common  than  they  themselves  believe.   VIEWPOINT  -----------------------------------------   RABBI  JOHN  LEVI   HOW  often  do  I  hear  deeply  committed  and  loyal  Jews  say  “Oh,  I  am  not  religious  you  know”  when  what  they  mean  is  they  don’t  behave  like  the  von  Trapp  family  in  The  Sound  of  Music  or  con-  form  to  modes  of  piety  their  grand-  parents  followed  in  a  different  world.   These  “not  religious”  Jews  pay  a  for-  tune  to  send  their  children  to  Jewish  schools,  religiously  follow  the  Aus-  tralian  Jewish  News,  care  deeply  about  Israel,  buy  a  challah  each  week  to  cele-  brate  Shabbat,  maintain  old  people’s  homes,  give  fabulous  sums  to  all  sorts  of  good  causes,  and  yet  they  are  “not  religious”  you  know.   Do  we  need  to  adjust  our  thinking?  According  to  the  dominant  sociologi-  cal  view  of  the  last  50  years,  religion,  along  with  the  state,  was  supposed  to  wither  away  in  the  face  of  modem  sec-  ular  rationalism,  while  science  and &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;   technology  eventually  overcame  every  problem  -  poverty,  illness  and  indeed   death  itself.  But  secular  humanism  has  not  proven  to  be  as  satisfying  as  many  thought  it  would  be.  The  evidence  for   this  failure  is  all  around  us.  Our  cities  and  suburbs  are  filled  with  New  Age  bookshops  glittering  with  magical  crystals,  scented  candlesticks  and  aro-  matic  therapies.  Australian  men  are  now  permitted  to  weep  in  public.  Brides  and  grooms  feel  empowered  to  write  their  own  marriage  vows,  and  children,  who  are  often  painfully  guilt  ridden,  feel  duty-bound  to  deliver   their  own  version  of  a  funeral  in  hon-  our  of  their  parents.   A  secular  post-modem  and  post  Christian  Australia  presents  a  new  and  different  context  for  religious  and  spir-  itual  dialogue.  Because  we  are  no  longer  strictly  controlled  by  both  the   state  and  traditional  established   organisations,  the  forms  taken  by  the  religious  impulse  have  become  increasingly  varied,  while  the  ethical  implications  of  belief  become  unclear.   We  can  see  a  reflection  of  this  in  the  Jewish  communities  of  Melbourne,  Sydney  and  even  Perth.  Once,  half  a  lifetime  ago,  there  were  really  only  three  or  four  major  Hebrew  congrega-  tions  or  synagogues;  in  today’s  Aus-  tralia  Jewish  places  of  worship   proliferate.  Suddenly,  in  our  own  inti-  mate  way,  Australia’s  Jews  reflect  the  fact  that  Australia  is  multicultural  and  multi-faith  and  spirituality  has  escaped  from  the  monopolistic  con  trol  of  formal  organisations.   THE  world  in  which  we  live  is  far   more  open  than  it  has  ever  been  before  and,  therefore,  inter-reli-  gious  dialogue  in  Australia  is  very  dif  ferent  from  yesterday.  When  we  began  to  meet  three  decades  ago,  Jews  were  the  only  significant  non-Christian  group  in  Australia.  It  really  was  us  and  us  alone.  This  is  no  longer  true.   The  2001  Census  told  us  that  there  were  358,000  Buddhists  in  Australia.  There  were  282,000  Muslims  and  83,994  Jews  -  about  the  same  number  as  the  Hindus  in  Australia.   In  1971,  less  than  one  million  Aus-  tralians  said  they  had  no  religion.  Today  three  million  Australians  write  on  their  census  form  that  they  have  “no  religion”  while  the  major  tradi-   tional  Protestant  denominations  are   ageing  and  decreasing.   The  charismatic  Christian  groups  that  increase  in  wealth,  power  and  size  have  no  interest  in  any  form  of  dia-  logue.  God  speaks  directly  to  them  and  they  have  no  sense  of  shared  spiritual  patrimony.  But  I  believe  that  most  Christians,  most  Jews  and  most  Mus-  lims  accept  that  there  is  a  need  to  keep  talking  with  each  other,  l’shem  shamayim,  for  the  sake  of  heaven,  in  what  can  be  called  a  trialogue.   Every  time  we  refuse  to  talk  we  empower  those  three  million  Aus-   tralian  “no  religionists”  who  say  that  religion  only  causes  war  and  turns  its  back  on  decent  human  relationships.  In  fact,  we  all  know  that  we  are  enriched  by  sharing.  We  belong  to  the  same  family.  When  a  Muslim  washes  his  hands  before  he  worships,  I  think  of  my  own  faith.  When  he  kneels,  bows  his  face  to  the  ground  and  lifts  his  hands  in  thanks,  I  think  of  the  ancient  temple  in  Jerusalem  and  of  Aleynu  on  Yom  Kippur.  When  a  Chris-  tian  congregation  sings  the  psalms,  we  confront  a  power  that  shatters  reli-  gious  boundaries.   I  have  not  mentioned  another  enormously  important  problem  that  we  share.  The  issue  of  our  schools  and  their  religious  identity  is  of  over  whelming  importance.  An  increasing  proportion  of  our  children  attend  our  own  primary  and  secondary  schools.  I  really  see  religion  and  education  as  closely  related  but,  of  course,  they  eat  up  our  communal  time  and  our  money.  Are  they  enriching  Australian  society?  Are  they  isolating  our  religious  communities  or  are  they  building  mutual  respect?  We  cannot  ignore  these  questions.  We  must  confront  them.

"  ROBERTSON  REBUKED   WASHINGTON-A  leader  of  a  Christ  ian  broadcasting  group  said  com  ments  about  Ariel  Sharon  played  a  part  in  the  Rev  erend  Pat  Robert  son's  (pictured)   loss  in  the  groups   election.  A  founder  of  the  Christian  Broad  casting  Network  (CBN),  Robertson  failed  to  win  any  of  the  33  seats  on  the  Nation  al  Religious  Broadcasters'  board  of  direc  tors,  though  there  were  only  38  candidates  and  Robertson  is  a  pioneer  in  the  field.  ‘There  was  broad  dismay  with  some  of  Pat's  comments  and  a  feeling  they  were  not  helpful  to  Christian  broad  casters  in  general,”  Frank  Wright,  the  organisation’s  president,  said.  Robertson,  who  has  been  a  board  member  for  30  years,  said  the  Israeli  prime  minister's  debilitating  stroke  in  January  was  retribu  tion  for  evacuating  Jewish  settlers  from  the  Gaza  Strip.

"  TIMELINE  OF  ISRAEL-LEBANESE  RELATIONS   LESLIE  SUSSER   MID-1950S:  Israel's  first  prime  minister,  David  Ben-Gurion,  had  visions  of  peace  with  an  independent  Christian  country  in  Lebanon.   Post-1967:  Because  of  the  weakness  of  its  central  government  and  its  proximity  to  Israel,  Lebanon  is  identified  by  the  Arab  world  as  an  ideal  base  for  Palestinian  terror.   November  1969:  The  Cairo  Agreement  gives  the  PLO  special  status  in  Lebanon,  and  after  their  defeat  in  Jordan  in  Septem  ber  1970,  Yasser  Arafat,  the  entire  Fatah  leadership  and  its  fighting  force  moved  into   southern  Lebanon.   1970s:  PLO  terrorists  carry  out  hun  dreds  of  cross-border  attacks  into  Israel.  One  of  the  worst  was  the  “Ma’alot  mas  sacre”  in  which  26  people,  including  21  students,  were  held  hostage  and  killed  in  a  school  in  the  northern  Israeli  town  of  Ma'alot   1975:  Outbreak  of  Lebanese  civil  war.  Lebanese  Christians,  seeking  to  restore  the  ethnic  balance  and  free  the  country  from  growing  PLO  control,  look  to  Israel  for  support   1976:  Syrians  intervene,  first  on  the  side  of  the  Christians,  then  on  the  side  of  the  PLO.   1981:  With  close  Syrian  support,  the  PLO  grows  bolder  and  in  July  launches  a  huge  artillery  barrage  on  northern  Israel.  War  is  narrowly  averted  through  last   minute  American  mediation.   1982:  The  cease-fire  breaks  down  when  Israel  launches  Peace  for  Galilee,  an  operation  designed  to  drive  the  PLO  and  the  Syrians  from  Lebanon  and  pave  the  way  for  a  peace  treaty  with  the  Lebanese  Christian  leadership  under  Bashir  Gemayel.   August  1982:  Gemayel,  elected  pres  ident  in  July,  speaks  of  peace  with  Israel,  but  two  months  later  he  is  assassinated,  presumably  by  the  Syrians,  who  saw  an  Israeli-Lebanese  alliance  as  a  strategic   threat   The  next  day,  Christian  militiamen  move  into  the  Palestinian  refugee  camps  of  Sabra  and  Shatilla  and  butcher  more  than  300  unarmed  civilians.

Under  intense  Syrian  pressure,  Syrian  President  Amin  Gemayel,  Bashir’s  older  brother,  renounces  the  agreement   After  the  war,  Syria  moves  troops  back  into  Lebanon,  and  quickly  regains  its  influence  over  the  Beirut  government  In  the  south  a  new  force  emerges:  Shi’ite  Muslims,  influenced  by  the  1979  Khome  ini  revolution  in  Iran,  form  the  Hezbollah  militia.  Israel  remains  in  occupation  of  a   security  zone  in  the  south  to  protect  its   northern  border.

"  Christians  condemn  Coogee  shul  attack   NICOLE  BRESKIN   SEVERAL  Christian  groups  have  rallied  in  support  of  Coogee  Syna  gogue,  which  was  the  site  of  a  report  edly  antisemitic  incident  last  month.   Francois  Kune,  the  president  of  the  Catholic  St  Thomas  More  Society,  wrote  to  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  last  week  condemning  the  attack,  which  he  said  was  “contrary  to  the  principles  of  religious  tolerance  and  common  decency  which  are  shared  by  the  vast  majority  of   Australians”.   Reverend  Lindsay  Johnstone,  of  St  Luke’s  Anglican  Church  in  Clovelly,  also  wrote  to  the  Board  of  Deputies  saying  that  he  was  “appalled”  by  the   attack   Coogee’s  Rabbi  Elozer  Gestetner,  who  has  been  with  the  congregation  for  20  years,  said  he  had  received  calls  from  at  least  five  other  Christain  con  gregations,  including  the  St  Nicolas’  Anglican  Church  in  Coogee  and  the  Uniting  churches  in  Randwick  and  Botany.  Rabbi  Gestetner  said  he  was  “very  grateful”  for  the  “huge  inter-faith  support”,  as  well  as  that  from  within  the  Coogee  community.   On  June  24,  a  window  was  smashed  as  an  intruder  broke  into  the  shul  leav  ing  a  trail  of  blood  on  the  floor.  The  handle  to  a  Torah  scroll  was  snapped,  a  silver  headpiece  damaged  and  smeared  in  blood  and  the  curtain  from  the  Aron  Kodesh  (Holy  Ark)  was  stolen.   The  attack  -  believed  to  be  the  first  at  the  shul  since  it  opened  in  1965  -  took  place  just  10  days  before  a  cere  mony  to  unveil  a  $1-million  redevel   The  AJN’s  report  on  last   week's  front   &gt;cover.   opment,  which  was  scheduled  to  take  place  after  the  AJN  went  to  press  on  Wednesday.   Coogee  Synagogue  president  Harry  Schnapp  would  not  be  drawn  on  the  total  cost  of  the  damage,  but  said  he  hopes  it  would  be  covered  by  the  shul’s  insurance  policy.  He  added  that  “tight”  security  measures  were  implemented  for  the  reopening,  which  was  to  be  attended  by  NSW  Governor  Marie   Bashir.   Rabbi  Gestetner  said:  “We’re  not  going  to  cower  or  close.  Services  will  go  on  as  normal.”   NSW  Premier  Morris  lemma  and  Opposition  Leader  Peter  Debnam  both  condemned  the  attack.   While  Police  are  yet  to  apprehend  any  suspects,  Maroubra  Police  Detec  tive  Inspector  Joe  Cassar  told  the  AJN  he  is  “fairly  hopeful  that  the  specimens  obtained  [at  the  scene]  will  be  suitable  enough  to  complete  a  [criminal]  pro  file”.  However,  he  acknowledged  that  the  DNA  matching  that  would  be  required  to  find  the  suspect,  provided  they  have  prior  convictions,  can  be  “a  slow  process”.   The  shul  renovations  included   increased  seating  capacity,  from  350  to  450,  and  new  stained-glass  windows. ",2006-07-07

"  Jewish  mayor  s  Bondi  Christmas  gift   MICHELLE  ROMAIN   CHRISTIAN  revellers  at  Bondi  Beach   can  thank  the  local  Jewish  mayor  for   the  festive  fanfare  this  Christmas  after  a  motion  to  erect  a  giant  Christmas  tree  and  other  decorations  was  passed  unanimously  on  Tuesday  night.

It   will  be  the  first  time  the  world-famous  beach  will  be  trimmed  with  Christ  mas  decorations.   Waverley  Mayor  George  New  house,  who  is  Jewish,  said  he  proposed   the  motion  to  assist  beachside  busi   nesses,  which  have  been  hit  by  a  tourism  downturn  this  year,  and  to  promote  inter-faith  tolerance.   For  the  record,  I’m  a  strong  believer  in  strict  separation  of  church   and  state  -  but  no  Australian  should   be  ashamed  to  celebrate  their  religious  festivals,”  Newhouse  said.   “In  our  multi-religious  society,  it  is  appropriate  we  recognise  and  accept  the  importance  of  Christmas  to   Christian  Australians.”   The  plan  appears  to  have  the  back  ing  of  the  Jewish  community.  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  said  it  is  beneficial  to  expose  the  religious  diversity  in  our  society.  “Christmas  is  a  major  festival  in  the  Christian  calendar,  and  it  is  entirely  appropriate  that  the  mayor  of  Waver  ley  -  who  represents  a  broad  range  of  faiths  -  should  support  it.

Gold  Coast  Hebrew  Congrega  tion’s  Rabbi  Nir  Gurevitch  and  Cap  tain  Ali  Al-Wahabi,  who  is  now  a  commercial  pilot,  have  developed  a  program  called  Passion  for  Peace  with  the  publisher  of  Al-Wahabi’s  biogra  phy,  Sandra  Rogers.   The  program  will  involve  visiting  schools  around  the  country  to  pro  mote  peace,  tolerance,  understanding   and  coexistence.   Rabbi  Gurevitch  said  the  group’s  primary  objective  was  to  promote  mutual  respect  for  one  another  regardless  of  religious  belief.   “Through  random  acts  of  kind  ness  and  respect  for  one  another  we  can  all  contribute  our  share  in  mak   ing  our  immediate  surroundings  and  our  circle  of  influence  a  better  place,”   he  said.   Forging   friendships  ...  the  story  from  the   March  17  edition  of  th  bAJN.   “There  couldn’t  be  a  more  solid  example  than  the  three  of  us  speaking  to  the  future  leaders  of  our  society  and  if  our  message  gets  across  to  them,  a  promising  future  is  in  sight.”   Rabbi  Gurevitch  and  Al-Wahabi  were  introduced  earlier  this  year  by  the  Jewish  ghost  writer  of  Al  Wahabi’s  autobiography,  Lynn  Santer.   Al-Wahabi,  one  of  Saddam  Hus  sein’s  personal  pilots,  was  raised  in  Baghdad  believing  everyone  from  the  West  was  his  enemy.   In  his  autobiography,  Farewell  Brave  Babylon,  he  says  that  time  spent  abroad  opened  his  mind  to  the  duplicity  of  the  Iraqi  leadership,  and  his  heart  to  a  desire  for  peace  and  har  mony  between  peoples.   A  percentage  of  all  proceeds  from  Farewell  Brave  Babylon,  which  is  pub  lished  by  Rogers’  company  Zeus  Pub  lications,  will  help  fund  Passion  for   Peace.

He  appears  to  me  to  be  a  tine,  upstanding  God-believing  man,  and  1  believe  he  should  be  supported.

They  don't  believe  in  God,  and  of  course  they  don't  believe  in  his  Son  Jesus  Chris,  because  if  you  don't  believe  in  God  and  all  he  made,  you  don't  need  a  Saviour,  and  they  try  to  tell  you  that  the  book  of  Genesis  in  the  Old  Testament,  is  all  fairy  Their  creed  is,  man  does  not  need  a  God;  he  can  fix  all  his  own  problems  on  his  own.

"  LIFTING  THE  LID  ON  EVERYDAY  ISRAELIS     MELISSA  SINGER     DID  you  know  the  most-widely-read   book  in  the  Israel  Defence  Forces  is  the  Christian  Bible,  or  that  the  most  common  name  given  to  Israeli-born  boys  is  Muhammad?   These  are  just  two  facts  about  life  in  everyday  Israel  that  US  journalist  and  former  Israeli  Television  pro-  ducer  Donna  Rosenthal  included  in  her  book  The  Israelis:  Ordinary  people  in  an  extraordinary  land  to  help  “smash  stereotypes”.   Rosenthal,  who  was  in  Australia  last  week  for  a  brief  private  visit,  was  inspired  to  write  The  Israelis  after  one  of  her  former  journalism  students,  now  a  producer  with  CNN,  called  her   to  ask;  “Our  viewers  are  confused.  We   have  footage  of  Jews  who  look  like  Arabs,  Arabs  who  look  like  Jews.  We  have  black  Jews,  bearded  16th-cen-  tury  guys  in  black  hats  and  sexy  girls  in  tight  jeans.  Who  are  these  people?”   It  was  then  that  Rosenthal  became  aware  of  the  narrow  view  of  Israel   Author  Donna  Rosenthal  ...  exposing  the  wide  spectrum  of  Israeli  society.     that  is  portrayed  in  the  media  -  images  of  the  Israeli-Palestinian  con-  flict,  ultra-Orthodox  Chassidim  pray-  ing  at  the  Kotel  -  and  not  just  to  the  non-Jewish  world.   “Even  Israelis  are  the  victims  of  their  own  stereotypes  ...  If  you  go   beyond  the  conflict  and  talk  about  the  people,  it’s  amazing  what  you’ll  find,”   she  told  the  AJN.   In  writing  The  Israelis,  Rosenthal  scoured  “basketball  courts,  board-  rooms  and  brothels”  for  subjects,  sticking  to  two  basic  rules:  no  famous   people,  and  no  politicians.   In  28  chapters,  Rosenthal  covers  topics  including  Mizrachi  Jews,  Christians,  Muslims,  gays  and  Ethiopians,  a  subject  which  has  a  spe-  cial  place  in  her  heart.  Not  only  is  Rosenthal’s  adoptive  brother  the  first  Ethiopian-born  Israeli  Air  Force  offi-  cer,  but  in  the  1970s,  Rosenthal  was  the  first  journalist  to  travel  to  Ethiopia  and  broadcast  audio  of  Jews  praying  in  mud  huts  that  one  day  they  will  go  to  the  Holy  Land.   She  says  her  book,  which  has  received  more  than  80  positive  reviews  from  both  sides  of  politics,  is  reportedly  being  read  by  government  ministers  in  Singapore  and  is  featured  on  the  reading  lists  in  many  US  Gov-  emment-run  high  schools.   “When  [a  book]  is  about  Israel,  you  really  don’t  know  how  it  will  be  received,”  she  says.  ----------------------------------------------------------------   The  Israelis  (Simon  &amp;  Schuster,  $29.95)  is   available  from  selected  bookstores.

In  true'gonzo'  style,  this  intrepid  reporter  put  himself  at  great  personal  risk,  donning  a  badly  painted  mask  and  some  plastic  pirate  props  to  march  as  one  of  the  rampaging  horde  of  undead.  The  numbers  were  swelled  by  roleplayers,  Town  Hall  goth  punks,  and  anybody  we  could,  hehehe,  'dig  up'.  Arrayed  in  everything  from  wedding  dresses  to  bloody  spears,  we  staggered  and  stumbled  through  the  city  yelling  our  demands:  'WHAT  DO  WE  WANT?  BRAINS!  WHEN  DO  WE  WANT  THEM?  BRAINS!'  Some  of  us  attacked  local  clothing  stores,  Virgin  Records,  arid  fast  food  places  but  left  after  finding  no  BRAINS!

"  Arts   A  Jesus  story  that  doesn’t   play  Passion's  blame  game   Film  review   THE  NATIVITY  STORY   Reviewed  by  Don  Perlgut   HERE  have  been  several  attempts  to  reach  and  engage  the  Christian  faith  film  audience  (as  Americans  quaintly  call  it)  following  the  phenomenal  suc  cess  of  Mel  Gibson’s  The  Passion  of  the  Christ  almost  three  years  ago.   The  recent  release  of  the  film,  The  Nativity  Story,  is  likely  to  be  one  of  the  most  success  ful  -  and  least  controversial  -  because  of  a  careful  combination  of  good  acting,  simple  scripting,  good  directing  and  high  production   values.   The  Nativity  Story  approaches  the  Jesus  story  from  the  opposite  end  of  Gibson’s  The  Passion  -  here  is  the  story  of  his  birth,  rather  than  Gibson’s  retelling  of  his  terribly  bloody  and  violent  death.  Thus  the  key  characters  are  Jesus’  parents  -  Mary  (young  New  Zealander  Keisha  Castle-Hughes  from  Whale  Rider  and  the  upcoming  bat  mitzvah  movie,  Hey,  Hey,  It’s  Esther  Blueburger)  and  Joseph  (Oscar  Isaac)  -  and  Mary’s  parents,  Anna  (Hiam  Abbass  from  Munich)  and  Joaquim  (Shaun  Toub).   This  is  no  radical  retelling  of  the  Jesus  birth  story  (think  of  Jean-Luc  Godard’s  Hail  Mary),  but  a  very  straight  approach  by  direc  tor  Catherine  Hardwicke,  who  is  best-known  for  her  empathy  for  young  people  in  Thirteen  and  Lords  ofDogtown.   She  does  a  reasonable  job  at  keeping  the  action  moving  and  balancing  the  needs  of  the  modem  film  (with  villains,  action  and  a  three  act  structure),  with  the  requirements  of  Christian  doctrine  and  story.  In  this  regard,  much  is  made  of  the  nastiness  of  King  Herod  (gleefully  played  by  Scottish  actor  Ciaran  Hinds,  also  from  Munich)  and  his  sly  and  fre  quently  brutal  attempts  to  maintain  and  manipulate  power  -  although  these  promis  ing  plot  strands  are  never  finalised.   The  Nativity  Story  is  played  so  straight  at  times  (filled  with  swelling  music  and  golden  light)  that  the  audience  is  relieved  to  find  a  small  humorous  interwoven  story  with  the  “three  wise  men”  from  Persia.  As  they  cross  the  desert  searching  for  baby  Jesus,  they  naively  joke  and  carry  on  like  a  comedy  act  -  almost  like  Bob  Hope  and  Bing  Crosby  in  Road  to  Morocco,  where  much  of  The  Nativity  Story  was  actually  shot.   While  the  cast  of  relative  unknowns  acts  well  (although  with  limited  material),  the  real   Kelsha  Castle-Hughes  plays  Mary  in  the  new  film  about  the  birth  of  Jesus,  The  Nativity  Story.   drama  belongs  to  Keisha  Castle-Hughes  and  Oscar  Isaac;  when  their  characters  journey  from  Nazareth  to  Bethlehem,  it  becomes  an  epic  in  which  Isaac  shows  his  heroic  acting  capability.   he  film  assiduously  avoi   uding  criticisms  of  th  Jewish  leaders.   All  of  the  characters  are  cast  and  depicted  as  being  appropriately  Semitic,  with  dark  fea  tures  and  thick  hair  (no  WASP-like  Jesus  here).  And  all  speak  in  English  in  varying   attempts  at  a  modem  Israeli  Hebrew  accent  -  with  the  addition  of  a  number  of  blessings  spoken  in  Hebrew  and  Aramaic  (pointedly  without  subtitles).   Also  interesting  is  what  The  Nativity  Story  does  not  do.  Aside  from  one  fleeting  reference  to  the  unholiness  of  the  Jewish  temple’s  activ  ities,  the  film  assiduously  avoids  including  criticisms  of  the  Jewish  leaders  or  sugges  tions  of  the  bankruptcy  of  the  Jewish  religion.   This  is  indeed  a  very  post-Passion  film,  carefully  defined  with  one  eye  on  its  target  audience  and  one  on  its  potential  critics:  there  is  no  attempt  to  de-Judaise  Jesus  or  his  family.   The  Nativity  Story  is  screening  nationally. ",2006-12-08
"  ?   Greetings  and  Salutations,  Christian  Douchebags.  I  hate  religion.  Spirituality  is  OK,  but  to  me,  dogma  is  garbage,  designed  for  tyranny  and  control.  And  at  the  moment,  Christianity  is  at  the  top  of  my  Religions  Shit  List.  More  than  oxymoronic  Islamic  Fundamentalist  Terrorists,  more  than  hypocritical  Jewish  Zionists  treating  Arabs  as  disposably  as  Nazis  treated  them,  it  is  the  21st  Century  Christian,  with  the  world's  most  dominant  and  domineering  religion,  who  irritates  me  most.  If  a  cult  is  a  religion  with  no  political  power,  as  Tom  Wolfe  thinks,  then  it  can  be  assumed  that  a  religion  is  a  cult  with  political  power.  And  Christianity  has  the  most  political  power  of  all.  I  regard  religion  as  a  crutch  for  people  not  strong  enough  to  stand  up  to  the  unknown  without  help,  like  Robert  Heinlein  wrote.  But  organised  religion,  with  its  organisational  politics  and  agendas,  I  hate  even  more.  Essentially,  something  as  beautiful  as  spirituality  has  been  subverted  and  hijacked  by  evil  people.  Whether  they  know  it  or  not,  whether  they  admit  it  or  not,  they  are  evil.  A  dialogue  between  maker  and  made  is  bombastically  interrupted  by  a  third  party,  a  religion,  to  tell  you  how  it  is,  like  somehow  their  connection  to  God  is  better  than  yours.  And  that's  the  point  at  which  I  begin  to  hate  them.  They  don't  use  their  alleged  clearer  connection  to  help  you  find  God.  They  use  it  to  push  you  to  support  their  agenda.  Neitzsche  agreed:  ""In  Christianity  neither  morality  nor  religion  come  into  contact  with  reality  at  any  point.""  Hypocrisy,  idolatry,  arrogance,  selfishness,  hatred.  These  are  the  characteristics  of  today's  Christian.  If  you  think  I  am  wrong,  ask  yourselves  how  I  could  come  to  be  so.  Christianity  at  its  base  has  an  assumption  regarding  the  Sons  of  Abraham:  that  Christians  are  right  -  and  the  other  siblings  are  wrong.  Mark  Twain  noted  this  tendency:  ""in  all  matters  of  opinion  their  adversaries  are  insane.""   Christianity  is  no  longer  about  faith,  love  and  life.  It  is  about  being  right  and  claiming  the  authority  to  use  force  that  accompanies  being  right  -  righteousness.  Until  recently,  this  type  of  maniacal  self-regard  had  been  limited  to  domestic  situations.  But  like  mould,  or  disease,  or  pure  beer  vomit  on  a  tiled  floor,  it  has  been  spreading.  It  has  crossed  seas  and  mountains  and  skies.  And  now  it  is  here.  The  War  Against  Terror  has  been  called  a  'clash  of  civilisations'.  Since  the  civilisations  involved  are  based  on  religions  (Christianity  and  Islam),  The  War  Against  Terror  (or  TWAT)  has  hijacked  religion  as  the  unspoken  front  upon  which  this  'war'  is  fought.  As  much  as  Islam,  Christianity  is  being  used  to  wage  this  war.  And  here,  Christian  Fundamentalists  encourage  politicians  to  strip  citizens  of  rights  and  choices.  Of  all  the  biblical  figures,  Jesus  was  most  about  love:  casting  the  first  stone,  loving  thy  neighbours  and  turning  the  other  cheek.  Christianity  would  not,  could  not  exist  without  Jesus  Christ.  And  yet,  he  and  his  teachings  are  the  most  forgotten.  It  is  strange  that  the  most  essential  figure  in  Christianity  is  also  the  most  discarded.  Today's  Christians,  rather  than  say  they  integrate  Christ's  teachings  into  their  lives,  simply  say  they  are  Christians,  as  if  to  say  ""my  character  is  beyond  question""  and  that  is  the  end  to  the  discussion.  They  have  forgotten  by  whose  namesake  they  were  baptised  -  it  IS  called  'Christ-ening'  after  all.  Remember  that  going  to  church  makes  you  as  much  of  a  Christian  as  standing  in  a  garage  makes  you  a  car.  There  is  more  to  it  than  that.  There  is  practicing  Christ's  teachings.  Next  time  the  collection  plate  comes  past,  reconsider  your  donation.  Instead,  donate  it  to  the  Red  Cross,  MSF,  Amnesty  International,  Oxfam,  Greenpeace,  The  Fred  Hollows  Foundation,  whatever.  Surely  these  groups  are  doing  more  of  God's  work  than  your  church  and  religion.   Buck  Smallsy  looks  loveable,  but  he  is  not. ",2006-05-25

To  back  up:  last  Friday  was   my  8th  encounter  with  The  Grates,  the  inimitable  Brisbane  trio  (sometimes  quartet)  responsible  for  the  hideously  annoying  new  single  '19-20-20',  the  new  album  'Gravity  Won't  Get  You  High',  and  various  b-sides,  EPs,  and  broken  hearts.  Led  by  the  energetic  Patience  Hodgson,  who's  a  strange  cross  between  a  squirrel,  a  cheerleader,  and  a  60's  go-go  dancer,  they've  been  touring  constantly  for  two  years.  Last  week  was  the  first  time  in  Sydney  since  the  release  of  their  new,  Ben  Lee-approved  album.  Supports  were  provided  by  fellow  Brisbogans  and  friends  [adjective  that  means  'from  Brisbanel  I  Heart  Hiroshima  and  the  Flaming  Lips  styled   Panda  Band,  whose  last  single  was  about  the  Grate's  drummer  ('Alana').  I  Heart  Hiroshima  were  energetic,  simplistic  pop,  but  they  got  the  crowd  going.  Panda  Band  started  off  strong  with  their  anthem  'Eyelashes',  a  perfect  slice  of  symphonic  pop  that  demanded  raised  lighters  for  its  soaring  religious  style  interlude  (  ""Jesus  I'm  like  you  an  only  son/only  I  ain't  coming  back  when  done"").  Things  got  a  bit  droney  and  samey  as  the  night  wore  on,  though,  and  their  exhortations  to  'practice  your  bouncing  with  this  next  song'  had  the  air  of  desperation.  'Alana'  was  not  played,  to  my  minor  surprise.  The  Grates  didn't  disappoint,  though.  This  is  my   8th  show,  and  the  formula  still  holds:  punchy  choruses,  good  hooks,  and  sexy  punk  songs  sung  by  a  girl  who  can  bounce  4  feet  in  the  air  and  twirl  a  mean  baton  ribbon  thing.  Pitchforkmedia.com  called  them  'indie  rock  porn',  and  they  might  not  be  far  wrong.  There's  an  overriding  sense  of  INNOCENSE  to  the  whole  thing,  though,  with  all  the  balloons  and  bright  outfits  and  giraffe  socks  at  the  merch  table.  Still,   there  were  no  shortage  of  30  year  old  bogans  joining  the  mosh  that  surged  and  bounced  and  pushed,  always  focusing  on  the  magnetic  Patience  (with  a  bit  of  love  for  shy  but  cute  drummer  Alana  Skyring,  guitarist  John  I-Drank-His-Booze-But-  Forgot-His-Last-Name  and  new  keyboardist  Conan  something  or  other).  It's  not  deep,  it's  not  serious,  but  it's  FUN—a  blast  of  orgasmic  energy  so  potent  that,  as  Pae  said  on-stage,  'people  pick  up  more  at  Grates  shows  then  at  other  shows'.  As  for  the  other  stuff  I  mentioned  at  the  start?  I  kind  of  know  the  band,  from  before  they  were  famous  and  hanging  out  on  the   Internet.  They're  nice  people,  so  don't  hate  them  too  much  when  they  push  better  bands  off  the  top  of  the  charts  and  steal  all  your  boyfriend's  attention  (girls  who  know  me  have  dealt  with  this).  Debauchery  followed  the  show,  though  with  none  of  the  sexual  edge  that  gives  the  music  its  punch.  But  remember:  mixing  white  wine  and  Jager  is  BAD.

"  'HIDDEN'   +  THE  HOLD   REVIEW   STEADY   What  would  you  do  if  someone  taped  your  house  for  hours  and  sent  it  to  you  with  freaky  pictures?  This  is  the  basis  of  Hidden's  plot  as  we  follow  an  ordinary  couple  (Daniel  Auteuil  and  Juliette  Binoche)  as  the  packages  they  receive  become  increasingly  disturbing.  Suspense  pervades  and  we're  drawn  in  with  the  who,  why  and  how.  Hidden  was  the  toast  at  Cannes  last  year,  and  has  continued  to  garner  acclaim  in  other  festivals.  The  film  deals  with  a  range  of  issues  -  marital  dysfunction,  the  mediocrity  and  nonchalance  of  the  middle  class,  guilt  and  conscience,  and  France's  own  ugly  military  history.  But  you  don't  really  care  about  any  of  this  because  the  film  was  just  so...goddamn...slow.  It  was  hard  to  keep  awake  at  times,  and  not  even  the  shocking  twist  in  the  last  20  minutes  could  have  redeemed  it  (though  admittedly,  it  was  pretty  fucked).  The  film  was  also  humourless  at  times.  The  only  people  in  the  theatre  who  laughed  were  the  same  well-to-do  middle  class  that  director  Michael  Haneke  was  having  a  go  at.  How  embarrassing.  Many  questions  went  unanswered.  Who  really  sent  the  packages?  Was  Anne  having  an  affair?  Did  Georges  ultimately  feel  remorse?  The  ambiguity  of  the  film  made  it  hard  to  care  about  today's  lack  of  social  consciousness,  or  any  of  the  other  issues  that  Haneke  was  trying  to  promote.  In  the  end,  the  lack  of  resolution  prevented  Hidden  from  being  an  otherwise  resonating  film.  The  final  verdict:  Meh.  See  Hidden  to  impress  your  friends  with  how  totally  cultured  you  are.   Separation  Sunday""  (Rating:  9  Hoodrats  on  10)  St.  Jerome's  Laneway  Festival:  His  eyes  rolling  back  in  his  head,  his  hand  clutching  at  air  and  sweat  dripping  off  his  middle  aged  frame,  Craig  Finn  screams  words  into  a  vacuum.  All  the  pretty  poetics  are  swallowed  up  by  the  maelstrom  behind  him,  Bruce  Springsteen's  E-Street  Band  crossed  with  the  Ramones.  I  don't  care.  He  reaches  out  to  me,  and  everything  is  so  sweaty  and  insane.  He  really  BELIEVES  what  he's  saying,  though  I  can't  hear  it.  The  show  has  proven  what  I  already  knew:  The  Hold  Steady  is  my  new  favourite  band.  If  you're  not  an  idiot,  it's  yours  too.  ""Separation  Sunday""  is  the  Hold  Steady's  second  album.  Informed  by  the  lead  singer's  Catholicism,  it's  a  concept  album  with  a  tight  literary  focus  and  a  rollicking  bar  band  sound.  He  spits  brilliant  couplets  out  like  a  Beat  Elvis  Costello,  chronicling  the  redemption  of  a  bunch  of  strung  out  junkies  and  hoodrats  in  LA  and  the  greater  Midwest.  Centering  around  Holly  the  Hoodrat,  who  gets  strung  out,  gets  fucked,  and  find  finds  religion,  it  ain't  boring,  'cause  its  funny  and  he  means  all  of  it.  You're  tossed  into  this  surreal  LA  of  banging  camps  and  black  and  tans  and  junkie  missionaries,  and  before  you  know  it  you've  hit  repeat  and  the  whole  album's  on  again.  The  music  is  not  your  usual  80s  revival  indie  stuff.  Muscular  beats  and  driving  guitar  that  explode  into  chugging  choruses  put  this  firmly  into  rock  and  roll  territory.  It's  got  all  the  grand,  redemptive  spirit  of  early  Springsteen  and  all  the  energy  of  a  great  Meatloaf  song.  The  lyrics  are  endlessly  quotable  (""I'm  trying  so  hard  not  to  fall  in  love  I  have  to  concentrate  when  we  kiss"";  ""Tripping  is  for  teenagers./  Murder  is  for  murderers./  And  hard  drugs  are  for  bartenders./I  think  I  might  have  mentioned  that  before.""),  each  one  following  like  a  joke  that  doesn't  stop,  until  it  gets  kinda  dark  and  scary  and  you  don't  know  if  he's  joking  anymore.  There  isn't  enough  I  can  say  to  recommend  this.  Get  to  www.theholdsteady.com,  download  the  two  tracks  on  the  website,  and  call  me  when  you  can  stop  listening  to  ""My  Little  Hoodrat  Friend"".  I  can  guarantee  it  won't  be  for  weeks.   Amy  Shi   Christian  Brimo ",2006-05-09

La  FIFA  a  donc  confié  à  Karembeu  (il  y  a  des  ambassadeurs  de  cet  organisme  mondial  pour  chaque  continent)  à  la  fois  le  soin  et  l'honneur  d'être  désormais  son  représentant  «  diplomatique  »  pour  la  région  :  à  ce  titre,  d'ailleurs,  le  footballeur  néo-calédonien  -dont  le  jubilé  sera  organisé  en  2008  à  Nouméa-  visitera  désormais  deux  à  trois  fois  par  an  les  pays  de  la  zone  (y  compris  la  Nouvelle-Zélande  mais  non  l'Australie  qui,  pour  sa  part,  se  voit  rattachée  à  la  confédération  asiatique)  avec  pour  mission  d'y  délivrer  des  messages  de  la  FIFA  et  notamment  celui  de  parvenir  à  resserrer  de  plus  en  plus  les  liens  entre  fédérations  nationales.

"  ?   The  Hold  Steady  -  Boys  And  Girls  In  America   ""Sometimes  I  think  Sal  Paradise  was  right/boys  and  girls  in  America  have  such  a  sad  time  together"".  By  referencing  Jack  Kerouac  in  the  first  line  of  his  new  album,  Hold  Steady  lead  singer  Craig  Finn  claims  the  cliché  that's  been  thrust  upon  him  by  eveiyone  from  Rolling  Stone  to  me  (in  this  paper)-  'bar  band  Beat  poet'.  Odd  then  that  this,  the  Hold  Steady's  3rd  album,  moves  away  from  the  specificity  of  their  first  two  albums  and  back  to  the  generalities  of  Finn's  previous  band,  LifterPuller.  In  other  words,  instead  of  telling  a  story  about  3  people  wrapped  up  in  drugs  and  scenes,  Boys  and  Girls  tells  a  bunch  of  little,  universal  stories  that  can  be  summed  up  in  one  line  —  'How  do  I  know  that  you're  high  if  you  won't  even  touch  me?',  '""He  was  kinda  cute.  We  kinda  kicked  it  in  the  Chillout  Tent',  ""I've  had  kisses  that  made  Judas  seem  sincere"".  The  characters  (Holly,  Gideon,  and  Charlagmane)/  from  their  first  two  albums  are  wrapped  up  in  one  lovely  song,  ""First  Night"",  but  the  rest  belonds  to  the  kids.  Tad  Kubler's  guitar  and  Franz  Nicolay's  keyboards  interplay  creates  tension  that  explodes  in  Finn's  singalong  choruses.This  might  be  the  Hold  Steady's  worst  album,  which  means  I  can  sometimes  go  an  entire  day  without  listening  to  it.  Like  their  other  2  albums  its  essential  to  your  life-  'Chips  Ahoy',  'First  Night'  and  'Citrus'  are  instant  classics,  and  'Southtown  Girls'  is  the  kind  of  jukebox  jam  that  splits  the  difference  between  Springsteen  and  Journey.  Its  also  their  most  accessible  album,  so  if  dense  poetics  turn  you  off  you  can  settle  into  45  minutes  of  new  classic  rock  and  Midwestern  brilliance.  As  always,  if  you  don't  like  the  Hold  Steady  then  I  DON'T  LIKE  YOU.  The  Blow  —  Paper  Television  Are  you  sick  of  that  Regina  Spektor  song  but  not  sick  of  hip,  jittery  love  songs  by  girls  who  actually  sound  24?  Want  to  dance,  but  not  mto  dance  music?  Need  a  perfect  song  for  the  ""2  weeks  into  the  relationship  and  you're  really  happv  with  this  guy/gal""  mix  CD?  The  Blow  is  here  to  groove  you  deep  mto  the  night.  The  mix  CD  song  is  ""Parentheses"",  and  by  the  second  track  the  band  has  already  dropped  a  classic.  Its  chilled  out  but  insistent,  and  the  lyric  is  perfectly  observed  —  ""If  something  m  the  deli  aisle  makes  you  cry  /you  know  I'll  put  my  arm  around  you/and  I'll  walk  you  outside"".  It's  dumb  and  cute,  but  that's  how  love  gets  sometimes.  This  is  basic  a  girl  group  album  if  Phi]  Spector  was  raised  on  electronica  and  not  dopey  harmonies.  I  prefer  the  classic  stuff,  there's  something  so  airy  and  lovely  about  this  album  that  it's  hard  to  hate  it.  Their  appeal  is  universal,  and  there's  something  for  everything  from  club  DJs  and  to  lovestruck  middle  schoolers.  There's  a  bit  of  twee  in  the  mix,  with  one  song  sung  in  French  and  the  whole  'two  girls'  thing,  but  it  never  reaches  the  heights  of  inconsequential  airiness  I  like  in  my  twee-pop.  That's  probably  a  good  thing,  though,  and  if  you  like  to  dance  or  love  or  remix  things  then  the  Blow  are  a  good  choice.  Jona  Bechtolt  and  Khaela  Maricich  don't  have  the  most  distinctive  voices,  but  they  do  great  with  what  they've  got  and  you  can  feel  the  love/jealously  whispering  in  above  the   beats.  If  The  Hold  Steady  make  me  obsessedthese  gals  just  make  me  happier  and  a  little  bit  cooler.   Christian  Brimo   Snowman  -  Snowman  So  it  is  a  bit  of  an  understatement  that  I  was  excited  when  I  finally  got  my  hands  on  the  new  Snowman  album.  But  I  think  what  has  surprised  me  more  than  anything  else  is  how  different  it  sounds  from  their  live  shows  and  their  EP,  Zombies  On  The  Airwaves  Of  Paris.  They  are  like  your  three  children  that  you  love,  but  secretly  you  love  one  more  than  the  others.  So  which  child  does  Snowman's  new  album  represent?  I  think,  like  most  people,  the  thing  that  got  me  hooked  on  them  was  their  insanely  energetic  live  shows,  showcasing  various  musical  skills  and  obvious  vocal  talent.  And  I  think  this  translated  well  onto  their  EP,  where  their  best  songs  (Lost  m  the  Woods,  Zombies  on  the  Airwaves  of  Paris,  Under  Houses)  sounded  crisp  and  exciting.  This  perhaps  was  the  first  thing  to  throw  me  when  first  listening  to  this  album:  Snowman  have  forgone  the  crisp  sound  of  the  EP  and  adopted  an  almost  cold  and  unapproachable  sound.  The  vocals  are  mixed  almost  to  unmtelhgibility  at  times,  and  you  get  the  feeling  that  Snowman  are  playing  behind  your  door,  just  out  of  the  corner  of  your  eye.  They  don't  want  you  to  sing  along,  they  don't  want  you  to  get  up  and  dance  and  they  certainly  don't  want  to  be  your  friends.  Sometimes  I  think  mixing  the  vocals  down  was  both  a  positive  and  a  negative,  the  obvious  negative  being  that  we  can't  fully  appreciate  the  amazing  range  possessed  by  Andy  Citawarman  or  the  haunting  croons  of  Joe  McKee.  The  positives  being  that  a  lot  of  the  lyrics  were  repeatedly  dealing  with  a  boring/generic  subject  matter  such  as  getting  drunk.  This  does  leave  a  lot  of  room  for  the  great  instrumentais  to  provide  a  lot  of  the  backbone  for  the  haunting  atmosphere.  There  are  genuine  moments  where  the  album  breaks  from  the  relentlessness  into  something  truly  remarkable.  Opener  ""The  Black  Tide""  is  a  beautiful  if  tainted  lullaby.  Single  ""Smoke  &amp;  Mirror's""  taps  into  an  awesome  Ennio  Morricone  vibe  and  there  are  some  genuinely  energetic  moments  such  as  ""Viva  La  Fever"".  It  was  fun  listening  to  the  album  and  recognizing  live  favourites  such  as  ""You  are  a  Casino""  and  the  finally  named  ""The  Last  Train  Outta  Town""  (As  they  were  asking  for  suggestions  at  last  year's  Interpol  shows).  But  repeated  listens  don't  exactly  cause  me  to  love  every  track.  In  the  20  or  so  times  I  have  listened  to  this  album,  I  still  feel  exhausted  by  the  end  of  it.  I  think  at  the  end  of  the  day  the  biggest  problem  with  the  album  was  myself.  I  think  my  expectations  were  too  high,  so  much  so  that  anything  would  have  disappointed  me.  I  was  expecting  a  brilliant  album  that  would  make  me  change  the  way  I  look  at  music,  but  instead  will  have  to  settle  on  a  very  good  one.  The  best  thing  about  listening  to  this  album  was  hearing  the  potential  this  band  has,  and  if  their  songwriting  abilities  keep  improving  their  future  releases  will  be  very  exciting.

"  WE  NEED  THEM   SAM  Lipski’s  column  (“Now  is  the  time  for  dialogue  with  Christians”,  AJN  31/3)  is  a  clarion  call  to  the  Jewish  community  once  and  for  all  to  recog  nise  that  dialogue  with  its  Christian  neighbours  is  not  something  from  which  to  walk  away  or  which  to  dis   dain.   The  simple  fact  is  that  as  long  as  we,  as  Jews,  cocoon  ourselves  in  our  own  self-centred  universe,  we  cannot  hope  to  create  awareness  and  understanding  by  the  Christian  world  of  Jewish  val  ues,  Jewish  attitudes  and  the  Jewish  way  of  life.   Conversely,  unless  more  effort  is  made  by  the  Jewish  community  to  embrace  greater  understanding  of  Christian  values,  Christian  attitudes  and  the  Christian  way  of  life,  the  aura  of  ignorance  which  breeds  prejudice  will  continue,  bringing  with  it  the  dis  trust  and  bigotry  which  underpins  not  merely  antisemitism  but  anti-Catholi  cism,  and  anti-  every  other  -ism  in  reli  gious  life.   It  is  understandable  that  elderly  members  of  the  Jewish  community,  particularly  those  carrying  the  scars  of  the  Holocaust,  find  it  difficult  to  enter  tain  the  concept  of  dialogue.  This  does  not,  however,  absolve  the  remainder  of  the  community  from  recognising  the  benefits  that  such  dialogue  will  ulti  mately  produce.

"  Australia’s  Lebanese  community  is  not  homogenous,  largely  because  many  Christians  and  Muslims  don’t  see  eye  to  eye,  and  although  the  current  fighting  has  created  a  surge  of  support  for  Hezbollah  among  Muslims,  many  Christians  still  harbour  dislike  for  the  terrorist  organisation.  LORIN  BLUMENTHAL  spoke  to  four  Lebanese  Christians.   RAYMOND  Khoury's  family  came  to   Australia  46  years  ago  in  search  of  adventure.  A  Lebanese  Christian,  he  says  when  he  goes  back  to  Lebanon  he  feels  threatened  by  Lebanese  Muslims.   “If  the  Jews  were  not  in  the  Middle  East,  we  would  have  to  pack  up  and  go.  They  hold  the  power  and  they  are  our  protection,”  the  48  year  old  told  the  AW.   “When  we  were  living  in  Lebanon,  my  fam  ily  were  treated  as  second-class  citizens.  I  still  go  back  there  every  couple  of  years.  The  Sunnis  in  Lebanon  have  learnt  to  live  with  us  but  we  cannot  even  look  at  the  Shi’ites  the  wrong  way,”  he  said.   He  adds  that  the  war  could  have  been  avoided  if  the  United  States  had  responded  to  the  bombing  of  their  military  base  in  Beirut  in   1983.   Khoury  echoes  the  sentiments  of  many  Lebanese  Christians  living  in  Australia  who  do  not  support  Hezbollah,  but  are  also  adverse  to  the  Israeli  bombings.   One  woman,  who  returned  from  visiting  her  family  in  Lebanon  last  week  and  wished  to  be  referred  to  only  as  Rania,  says  Hezbollah  are  “nothing  but  trouble”  and  “most  Christian  Lebanese  people  are  against   them”.   “I  don’t  support  the  killing  but  I  would  like  to  get  rid  of  Hezbollah,”  she  says.   According  to  Lebanese  Christian  author  Fouad  Abi-Esber,  35  per  cent  of  Lebanon’s  population  of  four  million  are  Christian,  roughly  1.5  million.  In  Australia,  55  per  cent  of  the  400,000  people  of  Lebanese  background   are  Christian.   Abi-Esber,  who  has  written  a  book  called   The  History  of  the  Rise  and  Fall  of  the  Christian  Minorities  in  Lebanon,  says  the  United  States  and  Israel  need  to  work  with  the  Lebanese  Government  to  force  Hezbollah  to  disarm.   “All  Lebanese  people  -  Christian  and  Muslim  -  want  peace,”  he  says.   Australian-born  May  Hayek  is  also  a  Lebanese  Christian.  She  told  the  AJN  that  even  within  her  own  family  there  are  mixed  feelings  about  Israel’s  attack  on  Hezbollah.   “My  mother  came  here  from  Lebanon  in  the  1970s.  Her  family  had  land  taken  by  Hezbollah  but  she  still  doesn’t  support  the  [Israeli]  bombings.  My  father  came  in  the  1960s  and  he  is  more  supportive  of  Israel’s  actions,”  Hayek,  22,  explains.   She  says  that  while  Hezbollah  is  a  terrorist  organisation,  the  bombings  are  counter-pro   ductive.   “More  moderate  Muslims  are  starting  to  follow  Hezbollah  now.  Bombing  south  Lebanon  won’t  achieve  what  the  Christian   Lebanese  want,  which  is  to  get  rid  of   Hezbollah.

"  Moshe  Agazai  (behind)  as  Schiomo  in  a  Sudanese  refugee  camp  with  his  mother,  played  by  Meskie  Shibni  Sivan.   Spotlight  on  Ethiopian  Jews   ANGIE  FOX   AT  a  Los  Angeles  Jewish  Film  Festival   dinner  seven  years  ago,  director  Radu  Mihaileanu  sat  next  to  a  Jewish  Ethiopian  Israeli.   The  young  man,  whose  entire  family  per  ished  on  the  long  journey  by  foot  from  Ethiopia  to  a  Sudanese  refugee  camp,  shared  his  remarkable  story  with  Mihaileanu.   The  man  was  part  of  Operation  Moses,  an  Israeli  military  operation  in  which  some  8000  Ethiopians  were  airlifted  from  Sudanese  refugee  camps  to  Israel  between  November  1984  and  January  1985.   “We  finished  up  in  a  bar  in  LA  at  4am  and  I  never  cried  so  much  in  my  life,”  Mihaileanu  told  the  AW  by  phone  from  his  home  in  Paris.   So  great  was  the  impact  of  the  encounter  that  it  inspired  Mihaileanu’s  new  film,  Live   and  Become.   “I  was  angry  because  I  could  not  under  stand  why  the  biggest  human  adventure  of  the  20th  century  was  not  known  by  the  whole  world.  I  decided  to  transform  invisible  people  into  visible  people  and  to  tell  everyone  what  these  wonderful  people  lived  through,”  Mihaileanu,  47,  said.   Five  years  in  the  making,  the  film  begins  in  a  Sudanese  refugee  camp  where  a  desperate  Christian  mother  urges  her  son  to  pose  as  a  Jew  in  order  to  escape  starvation  and  death.   The  story  follows  the  boy,  who  is  adopted  by  a  Jewish  family,  as  he  struggles  through  adolescence  and  adulthood  to  accept  his  identity  and  the  racism  prevalent  in  Israeli  society.   As  the  Romanian-born  son  of  Holocaust  survivors,  Mihaileanu  is  no  stranger  to  the   Radu  Mihaileanu  on  set  with  actor  Yael  Abecassis.   plight  of  the  migrant.  In  1980,  aged  22,  he  fled  Ceaucescue’s  dictatorship  for  France,  not  knowing  if  he’d  ever  see  his  family  again.  Fortunately,  after  many  years,  his  brother  and  parents  were  able  to  immigrate  to  France.   During  World  War  n,  Mihaileanu’s  father  was  forced  to  change  his  surname  from  Buchman  when  he  acquired  false  papers  to  escape  Nazi  persecution.   By  making  the  main  character  in  Live  and  Become  a  Christian,  Mihaileanu  said  he  was  attempting  to  fictionally  save  a  Christian  child  in  the  same  way  that  many  Christian  mothers  saved  Jewish  children  during  World  War  II.   “The  film  is  about  a  mother’s  love  and  that  is  very,  very  Jewish.  It  shows  that  when  a  mother  wants  to  save  a  child  it  doesn’t  mat  ter  if  the  kid  is  black,  white,  Christian,  Jewish  or  Muslim.”   Live  and  Become  had  its  world  premiere  at  the  2005  Berlin  Film  Festival,  where  it  won  the   audience  award  and  the  ecumenical  jury  prize.  The  film  also  won  the  award  for  best  original  writing  at  this  year’s  French  Academy  Awards.   When  the  film  opened  at  last  year’s  Haifa  Film  Festival  it  received  some  opposition,  mainly  for  its  criticism  of  Israel’s  ultra  Orthodox  rabbinate,  which  has  disputed  the  Ethiopian  community’s  claim  of  its   Jewishness.   “All  the  Israeli  movies  are  very,  very  critical  of  Israeli  society,  but  I  understand  that  they  don’t  like  it  when  someone  from  outside  criti  cises  them  because  they  are  always  criticised  by  the  rest  of  the  world,”  Mihaileanu  said.   Mihaileanu  received  international  acclaim  for  his  feature  Train  of  Life,  about  the  efforts  by  the  inhabitants  of  a  small  Jewish  village  in  Central  Europe  to  escape  the  Nazis  by  organ  ising  a  fake  deportation  train  to  get  across  the   Soviet  border.

"  ANC  boycotts  pro-Israel  conference   ETGAR  LEFKOVTTS   CAPETOWN  -  The  ruling  South  African  political  party  boycotted  a  pro  Israel  conference  held  in  Cape  Town  this  week  that  was  sponsored  by  South  African  Christians,   the  organisers  of  the  event  said.   Three  prominent  Christian  members  of  the  governing  African  National  Congress  Party,  including  former  Cape  Town  mayor  Normaindia  Mfeketo,  did  not  even  respond  to  invitations  to  attend  the  conference,  said  Dave  Wilken,  deputy  chairman  of  the  South  Africa  branch  of  the  Jerusalem-based  Inter  national  Christian  Embassy.  The  embassy  cosponsored  the  event  together  with  anoth  er  Jerusalem-based  Evangelical  Christian  group,  Bridges  for  Peace.   In  contrast  to  the  ANC’s  conspicuous  absence,  five  South  African  members  of  par  liament  from  two  opposition  parties  attend  ed  the  event,  as  did  several  legislators  from  other  African  countries.   “The  message  that  has  come  out  today  is  that  this  government  is  not  friendly  at  all  towards  Israel,”  said  Chris  Liebenberg,  a  par  liamentarian  from  South  Africa’s  main  oppo  sition  party,  the  Democratic  Alliance.   Liebenberg  said  the  government’s  aver  sion  to  anything  Israel-related  was  so  great  that  it  was  even  willing  to  forgo  Israeli  offers   of  economic  assistance.   The  African  National  Congress,  which  has  strong  historical  ties  with  the  Palestinians,  has  ruled  South  Africa  since  the  end  of  apartheid  in  1994.   Israel  has  proposed  an  array  of  educa  tional  and  medical  assistance,  including  one  involving  Israeli-discovered  drip  irrigation  and  another  for  infant  and  children’s  health   care.   At  the  same  time,  however  -  and  citing  a  busy  schedule  -  Israel’s  ambassador  to  South  Africa,  llan  Baruch,  was  also  absent  from  the  event  Organisers  suggested  that  the  conference’s  right-wing  outlook  was  like  ly  the  real  reason  the  diplomat  shied  away   from  the  conference.

"  TRUST  THE  CHRISTIANS   THE  editorial  in  AJN  (11/8)  described  an  imaginary  scenario  in  which  Hezbollah,  led  by  its  leader  Hassan  Nasrallah,  swept  to  power  in  Lebanon  through  a  mass  revolt  by  the  Shi’ite  population.  Even  if  the  editorial  was  supposed  to  be  imaginary,  it  is  impos  sible  in  today's  Lebanon.   Despite  the  firepower  and  militia  army  of  Hezbollah,  the  Christian  pop  ulation  of  Lebanon  comprises  40  to  45  per  cent  of  the  population.  Until  the  civil  war,  the  Christians  traditionally  held  the  balance  of  power  in  Lebanon.  They  also  control  most  of  the  econo  my  in  Lebanon  and  are  seen  by  out   siders  as  a  modern  influence  in  a   region  where  fundamentalism  is  striv  ing  to  crush  all  remnants  of  the  influ   ences  of  the  West.   The  Christian  Lebanese,  now  seen  as  powerless  in  relation  to  Hezbollah,  will  never  cede  full  political  power  to  a  fundamentalist  regime  such  as  Hezbollah.  They  would  fight  valiantly  in  another  civil  war  to  safeguard  the  liberal  and  western  lifestyle  they  cur  rently  enjoy  in  Beirut  Despite  some  convoluted  support  in  recent  weeks,  Lebanese  Christians  would  uphold  their  beliefs.  In  many  ways,  those   beliefs  are  the  same  as  the  West  and  Israel.   URI  BUTNARU  North  Bondi,  NSW ",2006-08-18
"  THE  TEST   JUN  ms  monthly  talk  to  the  Bnai   B’rith  at  Rose  Bay,  Rabbi  Jeremy   Lawrence  mentioned  that  at  a  recent   inter-faith  meeting,  a  bishop  had  complained:  “When  a  Christian  stops  coming  to  church  we  have  lost  a  Christian,  but  when  a  Jew  does  not  attend  synagogue  he  remains  part  of  the  community.”   Selwyn  Suchet  (AJN  8/12)  would  presumably  say  amen  to  that.  That,  however,  would  be  a  superficial  response.  If  his  “Orthodox”  friends  are  as  contemptuous  of  Jewish  law  as  he  says,  their  children,  if  they  have  any,  are  being  raised  to  treat  Judaism  and  Jewish  identity  with  contempt;  hence  intermarriage  out  of  the  faith  is  the  logic  of  their  upbringing.   This  is  precisely  what  happened  in  pre-Holocaust  Germany  and  is  sweeping  the  US,  as  indeed  it  is  the  secular  Jews  of  Israel  who  migrate  to  western  countries,  marry  a  local  non  Jew,  and  are  lost  to  the  community.   Thoughtful  Jews,  however,  recog  nise  that  our  brief  sojourn  in  this  world  is  a  test;  if  we  pass  we  shall,  in  due  course,  join  our  ancestors  in  the   world  to  come.   Fortunately,  Hashem,  in  his  mercy,  has  given  us  a  strong  antibiotic  for  the  kind  of  malaise  from  which  Selwyn   suffers:  we  call  it  antisemitism.

"  School  chaplain  support  raises  questions   SICHAT  YOSEF   YOSSIARON   The  ostensible  purpose  of  the   appointments  is  obviously  not   intended  in  any  way  as  sectarian,  but  to   teach  societal  values  in  schools.   ONTROVERSY  over  the   extent  of  religious  involve  ment  in  government  schools  is  not  new.  There   are  those  who  object  to  religious  edu  cation  right-of-entry  programs  pro  vided  by  the  United  Jewish  Education  Board  (UJEB)  in  Mel  bourne,  Academy  Board  of  Jewish  Education  in  Sydney  and  their  coun  terparts  in  other  states.  There  has  also  been  controversy  regarding  end-of  year  celebrations  that  refer  to  Christ   mas  and/or  Chanukah.   However  a  proposed  new  develop  ment  in  the  area  of  religious  involve  ment  in  the  government  school  system  requires  serious  consideration  by  the  Australian  Jewish  community.   In  recent  weeks,  the  daily  papers  have  reported  on  plans  to  encourage  a  national  schools  chaplaincy  program.  On  June  18,  Melbourne’s  Sunday  Age  reported  that  the  program,  whereby   state  schools  would  take  on  full-time   chaplains,  “has  won  overwhelming  Federal  Government  backing  and  is  being  seriously  considered  by  Prime  Minister  John  Howard”.   Similarly  supportive  is  Federal  Education  Minister  Julie  Bishop.   The  ostensible  purpose  of  the  appointments  is  obviously  not  intended  in  any  way  as  sectarian,  but  to  teach  societal  values  in  schools.   The  concept  of  appointing  a  chaplain  to  a  government  school  is  not  totally  new.  In  Victoria,  chaplains  have  been  employed  at  a  few  primary  and  secondary  schools  since  1955  and  the  Council  for  Christian  Educa  tion,  which  manages  the  program,  receives  about  $400,000  per  annum  in  state  funding.  Similar  programs  exist  in  other  states  though  they   Prime  Minister  John  Howard  and  Education  Minister  Julie  Bishop...  support  for  school  chaplains  raises  questions  for  the  Jewish  community.   operate  without  such  funding.   Despite  the  precedent,  letters  to  the  editor,  as  well  as  comments  made  by  the  Victorian  Education  Union’s  Mary  Bluett  -  who  described  the  pro  posal  as  “sickening”  -  showed  com  munity  division  over  the  issue.  Inevitably  some  want  total  separation   of  church  and  state  in  the  education   field;  some  argue  that  religion  does  not  offer  the  only  solution  to  value  education;  and  some  are  concerned  what  impact  a  religious  chaplain  could  have  on  students  from  different   religious  and  cultural  backgrounds.   Given  the  substantial  number  of  Jewish  children  who  attend  govern  ment  schools  across  Australia,  the  issue  is  indeed  of  major  relevance  to  Australian  Jewry.  So  what  are  the  issues  that  need  to  be  considered?   Firstly,  it  must  remain  a  given  that  government  schools  serve  all  ele  ments  of  a  multicultural  society.  From  a  Jewish  perspective  a  primary  concern  might  be  whether  the  chap  lains  should  not  be  limited  to  Christ  ian  appointees  of  the  Council  for  Christian  Education  (and  a  relevant  question  would  be  which  Christian   denomination  is  to  be  represented  at  a  given  school).  Perhaps  at  least  some  Jewish  input  into  the  appointment  process  would  be  warranted,  pro  vided  there  is  not  also  a  call  for  appli   cations  from  across  faiths.   One  option  could  be  employing  a  roaming  Jewish  chaplain  in  at  least  Melbourne  and  Sydney  -  and  an  arrangement  for  appropriate  service  provision  with  a  rabbi  or  other  reli  gious  leader  ill  Other  communities.   Secondly,  there  are  schools  in  Mel  bourne  and  Sydney  where  Jews  comprise  the  majority  of  the  student  population.  In  these  instances  the  question  would  be  which  Jewish  representatives  (and  from  which  stream  of  Judaism)  would  be  appointed  to  act  as  school  chaplains,  with  their  duties  including  serving  the  balance  of  the  children.  Indeed,  who  would  be  charged  with  making  the  rele  vant  appointment?  Surely  these  ques  tions  will  also  apply  to  schools  with  large  Muslim  and  Baha’i  student  populations.   Some  will  argue  that  an  Orthodox  Jew  could  never  countenance  the  pos  sibility  of  a  Christian  chaplaincy  influ  encing  Jewish  children  and  I  agree  that  there  may  well  be  dangers.  Neverthe   less  it  would  be  hard  to  oppose  the  concept  as  long  as  chaplains  adopted  a  position  such  as  that  stated  by  Peter  Mangold,  chaplain  of  Melbourne’s  Brighton  Secondary  College,  which  has  a  significant  Jewish  population.   In  Mangold’s  letter  to  the  Sunday  Age  (18/6),  he  wrote:  “As  a  govern  ment  school  chaplain  I  am  well  aware  that  implicit  religiosity  of  chaplaincy  does  not  give  me  permission  to  oper  ate  without  sensitivity  and  respect  for  other  ideological  positions  ...  Faced  with  global  terrorism  and  natural  dis  asters  ...  young  people  need  to  have  opportunities  within  our  school  com  munities  to  engage  in  the  meaning  making  processes  that  were  once  the  domain  of  our  religious  traditions.”   I  would  add  that  even  such  a   strictly  Orthodox  personality  as  the  late  Lubavitcher  Rebbe  was  strongly  in  favour  of  the  teaching  of  basic  reli  gious  and  moral  values  across  the  American  school  system.  He  restated  his  position  in  the  presence  of  senior  government  officials  on  many  occa  sions  despite  the  entrenched  Ameri  can  philosophy  of  constitutional  separation  of  church  and  state.   I  raise  the  aforementioned  issues  only  to  assist  in  discussion.  I  am  not  expressing  even  a  final  personal  view  point,  let  alone  that  of  an  organisa  tion  such  as  UJEB,  with  which  I  am  associated.  Nevertheless  it  is  my  per  sonal  belief  that  while  some  of  our  community  may  feel  uncomfortable  with  the  concept,  it  should  not  be   dismissed  out  of  hand.

"  Now  is  the  time  for  a  dialogue  with  Christians   PARTISAN   SAM  UPSKI   Jews  should  do  more  to   support  the  Council  of   Christians  and  Jews,  which   maintains  a  fruitful  dialogue  between  the  two  religions.   THIS  year,  as  often  happens,   Passover  and  Easter  coincide.  It  should  provide  an  additional  opportunity  for  interested  Jews  and  Christians,  especially  in  a  free  and  open  society  such  as  Australia’s,  to  come  together  and  reflect  on  “their  common  heritage,  a  desire  for  under  standing  and  dialogue  and  to  explore  their  turbulent  history  of  relating  to   each  other”.   But  outside  the  Council  of  Chris  tians  and  Jews,  from  whose  mission  statement  the  sentence  above  is  quot  ed,  this  is  unlikely  to  happen.  Even  within  the  ranks  of  the  council,  whether  in  Melbourne,  Sydney  or  the  smaller  centres,  the  human  and  finan  cial  resources  for  undertaking  signifi  cant  inter-faith  activities  are  limited.   One  reason,  of  course,  is  that  many  Christians  and  Jews  simply  don’t  know  the  council  exists.  Or,  in  the  case  of  many  Jews,  they  have  only  the  vaguest  notion  about  its  inter-faith  work  and  assume  it’s  out  to  convert  Jews  to   We  live  at  a  time  when   Judaism  and  Christianity  have  more  to  talk  about   to  each  other  than  at  any  time  since  the  founding  of  the  first  Council  of   Christians  and  Jews  in  London  in  1942.

This  is  disappointing  and  self  defeating.

In  that  dark  hour  for  the  Jewish  people  and  for  Britain,  the  Archbishop  of  Canterbury,  William  Temple,  and  Chief  Rabbi  J  H  Hertz  (of  the  Hertz  Chumash)  started  something  that  has  evolved  into  38  national  Jewish-Chris  tian  Dialogue  organisations  world  wide.  The  umbrella  organisation,  the  International  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  (ICCJ),  has  its  head  office  in  Heppheim,  Germany,  in  the  home  of  the  great  Jewish  theologian  Martin  Buber,  before  he  was  forced  to  flee  to  Palestine  from  the  Nazis.   Just  to  mention  that  time  in  Jewish  history  arouses  the  painful  awareness  of  how  Christianity’s  teaching  of  con  tempt  for  Jews  over  the  centuries  of  persecution  and  pogroms  created  the  culture  of  hatred  that  helped  to  spawn  Nazism.  And  it  underlines  how  a  pre  dominantly  Christian  Europe  aban  doned  Jews  to  their  fate.  There  were  righteous  Christians  who  saved  Jews  at  the  risk  of  their  own  lives  and  there  was  Denmark,  but  these  were  the  exceptions  to  the  rule.   ST  is  understandable,  therefore,  that   for  many  Australian  Jews,  and  not  only  Holocaust  survivors  and  their  families,  any  suggestion  of  dialogue  or  engagement  with  Christians  remains  anathema,  even  when  enlightened  self  interest  would  suggest  a  strong  case  for   it.   Put  simply,  if  crudely:  Jews  need  the   council  more  than  the  Christians.   The  council  (www.ccjaustralia.org)  itself  is  much  more  ecumenical  and  even-handed  in  arguing  that  Christians  and  Jews  both  need  it  because  we  live  in  a  multicultural  society,  prejudice  is  dangerous,  antisemitism  continues  and  is  often  related  to  other  evils,  the  insights  of  Judaism  and  Christianity  provide  a  powerful  force  to  deal  with  contemporary  issues,  and  while  “we   cannot  put  the  world  to  rights  ...  we  can  tackle  the  problems  that  directly   confront  us”.   Indeed  the  more  that  Judaism  and  Christianity  talk  together,  the  more  -  and  better  -  they  can  engage  with  the  third  of  the  Abrahamic  faiths,  Islam.  The  council  has  begun  to  do  this  in  a  tentative  way  with  some  encouraging  signs.  And  if  there  were  no  other  rea  son  for  Australian  Jews  to  support  the  council  far  more  vigorously  -  with  funds  and  members  -  than  we’ve  been   prepared  to  do  in  its  first  two  decades,   that  would  be  reason  sufficient.   But  there  are  more  reasons,  chief  amongst  them  the  re-emergence  of  antisemitism  and  the  ongoing  vilifica  tion  of  Israel.  When  some  of  those  manifestations  are  promoted  or  sup  ported  by  Christian  churches  and  their  NGOs  dealing  with  the  Third  World  and  the  Palestinians,  the  need  for  Christian  friends  becomes  even  more  compelling.   Australian  Jews  are  fortunate  that  over  the  years  the  council  has  attracted  some  of  the  country’s  most  prominent  and  influential  Christian  leaders,  and  some  remarkably  dedicated  groups  such  as  the  Catholic  Church’s  Sisters  of  our  Lady  of  Sion.   That  Australians  of  goodwill  in  the  majority  faith  are  prepared  to  work  with  a  small  minority  faith  for  the  common  good  is  something  we  Jews  should  acknowledge  and  welcome  far  more  supportively.  Besides,  there’s  a  bonus:  there  aren’t  too  many  other  forums  where  our  own  Orthodox,  Conservative  and  Liberal  rabbis  come   together  as  readily  as  they  do  within   the  council.

"  The  good  news  on  Jewdas   BEYOND  WORDS   RUTH  WAJNRYB   After  serving  for  2000  years  as  the  archetypal  image  of   the  betraying  Jews,  the  image  of  the  New  Testament's  Judas  is  finally  improving.   JUDAS  seems  to  have  hired  a   new  PR  firm  to  manage  his  affairs.  About  2000  years  late,  but  never  mind.  For  all  that   time  the  version  ot  history,  as  written   by  the  victors,  depicted  Jesus  as  betrayed  and  killed  by  the  Jews.  It  can  only  get  better.   Stop  press!  Under  a  front-page  headline,  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald  (7/4)  proclaimed:  “In  his  own  words:  Judas  the  betrayer  was  really  Judas  the  chosen  one.”  The  article  reported  that  a  1700-year-old  manuscript,  consid  ered  the  only  surviving  copy  of  the  lost  Gospel  of  Judas,  was  being  published  by  the  National  Geographic  Society.  (A  Christian  theologian  friend  of  mine  cynically  wonders  why  these  conspiracy  theories  always  seem  to  emerge  around  Easter.)   The  document  implies  that  Judas  was  “under  orders”  when  he  suppos  edly  acted  treacherously  towards  Jesus.  In  other  words,  far  from  betray  ing  his  leader,  Judas’  much-maligned  act  was  one  of  obedience,  thereby  allowing  Jesus  to  fulfil  his  “theological  destiny”.   So,  it  was  all  in  the  script,  and  has  been  from  the  start  All  that  drama  —  the  betrayal,  the  handover  of  silver  pieces,  the  arrest  and  tortured  killing  of  Jesus  -  was,  well,  predetermined,  pre  constituted,  if  you  like.  Judas  was  the  fell  guy  and  what  a  great  fell  guy  he  was.   The  thing  is,  if  we’re  talking  about  the  sacrifice  of  one  life  for  the   (allegedly)  greater  good,  perhaps  Judas’  act  might  be  seen  as  a  good  thing.  But  it’s  a  mighty  big  “if”.  First  off,  did  Judas  have  any  free  will  in  the  original  decision?  Second,  did  “a  greater  good”  emerge  anyway?  And  third,  how  does  any  of  this  justify  the  vengeance  meted  out  to  Jews  ever  since,  with  Judas’  descendants  (also,  incidentally,  the  descendants  of  Jesus  -  more  on  that  later)  deemed  responsi  ble,  symbolically  and  collectively,  for  Jesus’  fete.   In  many  representations  of  the  Last  Supper  and   surrounding  events,  Jesus  is  benevolently  beautiful,  often  blond,  while  Judas  is  darkly  brooding  and   malevolent.   Because,  let’s  not  mince  words,  we’ve  been  made  to  pay  the  price.  It’s  funny  (not  funny  ha-ha)  that  until  recently,  the  Christian  Church  has  had  a  great  deal  of  difficulty  acceding  that  Jesus  was  Jewish,  but  no  difficulty  whatever  calling  Judas-the-betrayer  a   Jew.  In  feet,  the  Jew.  Jesus  lived  and  died  as  a  Jew,  but  is  remembered  as  a  Christian.  Judas,  the  one  supposedly  with  blood  on  his  hands,  is  remem  bered  always  as  the  Jew.  It’s  a  double  whammy  and  it’s  a  great  gambit.  By  remembering  all  the  key  players  as  Christians,  Judas  -  the  betrayer  -  emerges  as  the  Jew.  If  they’d  all  been  remembered  as  Jews,  Judas  would  just  have  been  one  of  the  guys.   In  many  representations  of  the  Last  Supper  and  surrounding  events,  Jesus  is  benevolently  beautiful,  often  blond,  while  Judas  is  darkly  brooding  and  malevolent.  In  Latin,  Greek,  German,  French,  Spanish  and  English,  the  word  for  “Judas”  and  the  word  for  “Jew”  are  phonically  similar.  It  therefore  is  no  accident  that  Judas  has  unfolded  his  torically  as  the  archetypal  Jew  in  the  antisemitic  imagination.   At  least  on  paper,  the  Christian  perception  has  changed.  In  the  Vati  can’s  Nostra  Aetate  (1965),  the  Jews  were  released  of  responsibility  for  dei  cide  and  the  collective  fetwa  was  with  drawn.  The  ink’s  dry  on  that  document  but  it’ll  take  a  bit  longer  for  the  rbind-set  to  change.  Even  the  last  Pope,  while  knowing  that  Mel  Gib  son’s  representation  of  the  crucifixion  was  woven  in  a  pre-Vatican  II  fabric,  allegedly  declared,  upon  seeing  The  Passion  of  the  Christ,  “It  is  as  it  was.”   So  deeply  embedded  is  the  motif  of  Judas-the-betrayer  that  it  slips  into  people’s  discourse  without  conscious   awareness.  Remember  John  Brogden’s  comments  -  which  he  later  withdrew  -  during  the  Orange  Grove  factory  inquiry,  in  September  2004?  “Bob  Carr  is  a  Judas  to  the  people  of  west  ern  Sydney,”  he  declared.  “He  has  taken  his  30  pieces  of  silver  from  West  field  and  they  get  a  good  deal.”   At  least  today,  we’re  somewhat  more  aware  of  how  language  choices  reflect  and  shape  attitudes.  When  I  was  at  school  in  the  ’50s  and  ’60s,  the  word  “Christian”  was  used  inter   changeably  with  “a  good  human  being”,  leaving  you-know-whom  very   much  out  in  the  cold.   It  would  be  very  nice  if  the  Judas  story  could  be  laid  to  rest.  However,  as  long  as  it’s  deemed  essential  to  the  Jesus  story,  it  won’t  be.  So  you  get  your  ultimate  self-fulfilling  prophecy.  Vlodek,  the  Pole,  goes  to  church  on  Easter  Sunday  and  rushes  out  at  the  end  of  the  service  yelling,  ""Where’s  a  Jew?  Where’s  a  Jew?  I’ve  got  to  kill  me  a  Jew!”   “What’s  your  hurry?”  asks  a  mate  of  Vlodek’s,  to  which  Vlodek  replies:  “The  Jews  killed  Christ,  our  Lord.  I’ve  got  to  kill  one.”   “Yeah,  OK,”  says  the  mate,  “but  that  was  2000  years  ago”.   “Yes,  I  know,”  says  Vlodek,  “But  I  just  found  out”   Dr  Ruth  Wajnryb  is  an  applied  linguist   with  a  weekly  column  in  the  Sydney  Morning  Heralds  Spectrum.

"  The  Da  Vinci  Code  and  the  Jews   RABBI  BENJAMIN  BLECH  finds  a  positive  side  to  negativity  towards  The   Da  Vinci  Code.   I  What  strikes  me,  as  a   rabbi,  is  the  remarkable  irony  that  Brown's   theories  about  Jesus,   which  is  blasphemous  to  Christians,  make  Jesus   far  more  comprehensible  to  Jews.   THE  Da  Vinci  Code  is  com   monly  called  “the  runaway  bestseller  of  the  21st  century”.  And  that  hasn’t  made  the   Catholic  Church  very  happy.   For  centuries,  Christians  have  been  taught  that  the  Holy  Grail  is  the  cup  from  which  Jesus  drank  at  the  Last  Supper.  But  for  author  Dan  Brown’s  all-knowing  art  critic  and  alter-ego  Robert  Langdon,  that  isn’t  true.   “The  Grail,”  Langdon  tells  us,  “is  symbolic  of  the  lost  goddess.  When  Christianity  came  along,  the  old  pagan  religions  did  not  die  easily.  Legends  of  chivalric  quests  for  the  Holy  Grail  were,  in  fact,  stories  of  for  bidden  quests  to  find  the  lost  sacred  feminine.  Knights  who  claimed  to  be  ‘searching  for  the  chalice’  were  speak  ing  in  code  as  a  way  to  protect  them   selves  from  a  church  that  had   subjugated  women,  banished  the  goddess,  burned  non-believers,  and  forbidden  the  pagan  reverence  for  the  sacred  feminine”  (pages  238-239).   And  there  is  more.  A  woman’s   body  is  symbolically  a  container,  and   the  most  famous  of  these  has  a  name   every  Christian  will  immediately  recognise.  Brown  claims  that  the  Holy  Grail  was  actually  Mary  Magda  lene.  She  was  married  to  Jesus  and  was  the  vessel  that  bore  his  children.   The  secret  that  could  not  be  revealed  since  the  birth  of  Christian  ity  is  that  Jesus’  bloodline  continues  to  flourish  to  this  day.  The  grand  mas  ters  of  the  Priory  of  Sion  (an  actual  Christian  organisation),  among  whom  Brown  lists  Leonardo  Da  Vinci,  Isaac  Newton  and  Victor  Hugo,  have  -  according  to  the  book’s  prem  ise  -  kept  to  their  oath  never  to  reveal  this;  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  is  committed  to  suppressing  this  infor  mation.  Brown  strongly  hints  that   Tom  Hanks  and  Audrey  Tatou  In  a  scene  from  The  Da  Vinci  Code.  While  the  film  has  angered  some  Catholic  groups,  it  has  caused  no  such  problems  among  the  Jews.   Photo  courtesy  Sony  Pictures   only  fortunate  readers  of  this  “docu  mentary  disguised  as  fiction”  may  at  last  share  in  this  incredible  revelation.   Small  wonder  the  church  is  pro  foundly  disturbed.  If  The  Da  Vinci  Code  premise  is  true,  Rome  needs  to  revise  its  beliefs  as  well  as  the  story  of  its  beginnings.   But  what  strikes  me,  as  a  rabbi,  is  the  irony  that  Brown’s  theories  about  Jesus,  which  is  blasphemous  to  Chris  tians,  make  Jesus  far  more  compre  hensible  to  Jews.   So  Jesus  was  married!  Why  shouldn’t  he  have  been?  Reared  as  a   Jew,  celibacy  would  almost  certainly  have  been  an  idea  totally  foreign  to  him.  “Be  fruitful  and  multiply”  was  the  biblical  creed  that  all  Jews  consid  ered  sacred.  Celibacy  as  a  Christian  ideal  wouldn’t  become  law  until  the  Council  of  Elvira  (300-306  CE)  decreed  (Canon  33):  “It  is  decided  that  marriage  be  altogether  prohib  ited  to  bishops,  priests,  and  deacons,  or  to  all  clerics  placed  in  the  ministry.”   Christian  scholars  explain  that  the  church  wanted  to  insure  that  the  wealth  of  its  leadership  would  not  be  dissipated  by  way  of  family  inheri   tance.  A  non-married  clergyman  would  always  return  his  possessions   to  Rome.   Historians  have  pointed  out  the  chilling  effects  of  this  doctrine.  The  “best  and  the  brightest”  were  invari  ably  encouraged  to  enter  the  presti  gious  life  of  the  priesthood,  effectively  condemning  their  genes  to  hereditary  oblivion.  Jews,  on  the  other  hand,  turned  those  with  the  greatest  intel  lectual  potential  to  rabbinic  lives  of  learning  combined  with  an  emphasis  on  large  families.  That,  claims  Will  Durant  in  his  classic  The  Lessons  of  History,  is  what  in  all  probability  accounts  for  the  statistically  unbeliev  able  preponderance  of  Jewish  Nobel   Prize  winners.   More  troubling  for  Christians,  a  married  Jesus  is  far  too  much  a  human  figure  instead  of  a  god  to  be  worshipped.  Christianity  can’t  con  ceive  of  their  object  of  divine  rever  ence  as  a  sexual  being  -  or  even  as  one  conceived  by  sexual  acts.  It  is  a  troublesome  relationship  with  physi  cal  pleasure  that  turned  Christian  teachings  away  from  their  Jewish  bib  lical  source.  But  Jews  have  no  prob   lem  with  a  married  Moses.  The  Torah  of  Moses  not  only  commands  mar  riage,  but  also  calls  it  kiddushin  —  an   ideal  state  of  holiness.   Here  is  the  crux  of  a  crucial  con   cept  that  has  separated  Judaism  from  Christianity  throughout  the  cen  turies.  Jews  spared  no  effort  to  insure  that  their  greatest  leader  never  be   confused  with  God;  Moses  was  always  to  be  viewed  as  human,  mor  tal,  less  than  divine,  even  capable  of  sin,  for  which  he  was  punished  and  denied  entry  into  the  promised  land.  The  greatness  of  Moses  rests  precisely  in  his  human  qualities.  He  represents  mankind’s  potential.  In  him,  we  see  what  we  fellow  human  beings  are  capable  of  becoming.   Christians,  on  the  other  hand,  insisted  that  Jesus  be  viewed  not  as  an  elevated  man  but  a  god  descended  to  earth.  Physical  frailties  and  human  weaknesses  couldn’t  possibly  be  part  of  his  make-up.   And  that  is  what  Brown  has  breached  in  revealing,  albeit  in  an  ostensibly-fictionalised  account:  a  “human”  truth  about  Christianity’s  founder.  A  married  Jesus  with  chil  dren  is,  for  the  church,  nothing  less  than  a  diminished  god.   That’s  why  Jews  shouldn’t  be  upset  about  the  success  of  The  Da  Vinci  Code.  After  all,  it’s  responsible  for  making  millions  of  people  ques  tion  what  Jews  have  long  recognised  about  Christianity’s  founder:  Jesus  was  not  God,  he  was  human.   And  perhaps  the  day  will  come  when  the  world  will  acknowledge  what  Judaism  teaches:  it  isn’t  God  who  became  man,  but  man  who  must  strive  to  become  more  like  God.

"  plans  College's  future   During  the  first  #eek  of  Term  2,  the  Northern  Peninsula  Area  College  held  its  first  School  Council  meeting.  ,  The  School  Council  is  comprised  of  staff  from  the  College,  Students  Leaders  and  community  Council  representatives.  The  School  Council  has  met  to  begin  planning  for  the  college's  future  and  looks  at  the  long  term  future,  and  takes  a  strategic  approach.  Data  from  the  Education  Queensland  was  presented  and  discussed  by  the  School  Council.  Head  of  senior  Campus  said  ""it  is  clear  we  do  a  lot""  of  things  very  well,  but  we  also  must  improve  areas  that  are  not  performing  as  well  as  we  hope.  The  School  Council  looked  at  the  College's  results   in  the  Year  2  Net,  Statewide  Tests,  (year  3,  5  and  7)  and  Senior  School  outcomes.  Benjamin  Gebadi  reflected  in  the  meeting,  ""It  is  good  to  see  the  results  clearly  and  in  a  straight  forward  manner.  This  helps  us  make  good  decisions""  During  the  meeting,  the  School  Council  identified  areas  to  work  on  over  the  term.  This  includes  looking  at  our  subjects  and  seeing  how  well  they  matched  up  to  employment  needs  and  students  ambitions.  Also  the  College  will  trial  running  the  P&amp;C  meetings  in  the  communities  as  well  as  holding  Community  events  in  a  community  to  showcase  student  learning.  Student  Leaders  Aldene  Reuben  Tahirah  Christian  were  part  of  the  meeting.  Aldene  Reuben  (Year  11)  and  Tahirah  Christian  (Year  12)  enjoyed  being  part  of  looking  at  the  College's  directions.  The  Northern  Peninsula  Area  College  intends  to  conduct  a  School  Council  meeting  every  term.  Outcomes  from  the  meeting  and  minutes  will  be  provided  to  all  Community  Councils  so  that  the  families  in  Injinoo,  Umagico,  Bamaga,  New  Mapoon  and  Seisia  are  kept  informed  of  progress.   ?   ?

"  omosexuality  in  Christianity  and  Islam,  an  analysis.   Sexuality  within  traditional  religions  is  one  of  the  more  contentious  issues  in  both  modern  times  and  medieval  times;  especially  where  sexuality  deviates  from  the  mean.  Much  of  our  contemporary  attitude  towards  sexuality  has  its  roots  in  religious  scripture,  and  until  the  last  century,  provided  the  legalistic  foundation  for  dealing  with  such  issues.  This  article  will  look  at  homosexuality  as  it  is  interpreted  through  the  religious  traditions  of  Christianity  and  Islam.  A  brief  overview  of  conservative  and  liberal  scriptural  interpretations  will  be  provided.  Christianity  The  Bible  remains  the  sole  ecclesiastical  scripture  for  Christian  churches.  The  following  verses  are  commonly  cited  in  reference  to  homosexual  conduct  by  various  Christian  authorities  (all  Biblical  references  are  based  upon  the  King  James  Bible):  Genesis  1:27  ,  2:18  ,  19:4-5  ,  Leviticus  18:22,  Romans  1:26-27  ,  1  Timothy  1:10  &amp;  1  Corinthians  6:9-10  .  Interpretations  on  these  texts  can  be  roughly  divided  into  three  distinct  periods  in  Christian  history;  each  one  demonstrating  an  evolution  in  Christian  thought  on  homosexuality.  The  first  era  of  Christian  thought  is  reflected  in  St.  John  Chrysostom's  fourth  homily  on  Romans  which  contended  that  the  act  of  homosexual  congress  was  worse  than  murder,  and  those  found  enjoying  it  made  the  act  worse  by  celebrating  the  sin.  The  second  era  is  found  in  St.  Thomas  Aquinas's  philosophies  on  sexuality,  which  argue  against  acts  which  are  contrary  to  a  teleological  natural  law  and  therefore  immoral.  Subsequently,  St.  Thomas  Aquinas  describes  any  sexual  act  not  directed  to  the  purpose  of  procreation,  such  as  homosexual  sex,  as  an  unnatural  inclination.  As  an  'unnatural  inclination',  homosexuality  became  synonymous  with  a  departure  from  divine  law;  making  it  not  merely  an  aberration  but  an  abuse  of  divinely  given  sexuality.  Conservative  vs.  Liberal  Broadly  speaking,  the  various  approaches  to  homosexuality  can  be  divided  into  conservative  and  liberal  interpretations.  In  essence,  conservative  interpretations  consider  various  historical  teachings  (e.g.  conservative  scriptural  interpretations,  The  Didache,  First  Apology  (Justin  Martyr),  Exhortation  to  the  Greeks  (Clement  of  Alexandria),  The  Instructor  (Tertullian),  Modesty  (Novation),  The  Jewish  Foods  (Cyprian  of  Carthage),  Against  the  Pagans  (Arnobius),  Proof  of  the  Gospel  (Eusbius  of  Caesaria),  The  Renunciation  of  the  World  (John  Chrysostom),  Confessions  (Augustine)  &amp;  The  Apostolic  Constitutions)  as  examples  of  the  denouncement  of  homosexuality  from  the  conception  of  the  church.  Such  arguments  can  be  found  to  be  synonymous  with  arguments  of  the  Bible's  (and  often  the  Catholic  Church's)  infallibility;  it  suggests  that  all  scripture  is  divinely  inspired  and  should  be  interpreted  literally  .   There  is  no  single  categorical  definition  of  the  liberal  interpretation  on  scripture.  About  the  only  single  issue  generally  agreed  upon  is  the  rejection  of  infallibility.  In  response  to  this,  liberal  interpretation  recognises  that  the  historicity  of  religious  texts  and  the  possibilities  of  any  mistranslations/interpretations  must  be  taken  into  account.  As  such,  a  liberal  interpretation  does  not  regard  the  text  as  divinely  inspired,  but  the  work  of  human  authors  and  are  therefore  potentially  biased  towards  author's  or  translator's  prejudices.  As  such,  the  context  in  which  the  text  was  written  is  extremely  important.  For  example,  Boswell  cites  in  his  work  Same-Sex  Unions  in  Pre-Modern  Europe  that  the  early  Christian  ritual  of  Adelphopoiesis,  which  was  a  ritual  of  union  between  two  people  of  the  same  gender  (frequently  men),  was  an  example  of  ecclesiastic  support  of  same-sex  unions.  Boswell  suggests  that  this  was  a  sanctioned  romantic  and  sexual  relationships  between  same-sex  couples,  though  his  critics  consider  this  rite  to  be  more  of  a  form  of  blood-brother  pact.  However,  Boswell  remains  an  outspoken  advocate  of  liberal  interpretations,  suggesting  that  contemporary  conservative  attitudes  on  homosexuality  in  Christendom  didn't  arise  until  the  12th  Century  as  part  of  a  pogrom  against  various  minorities  .  Contemporary  Christian  attitudes  on  homosexuality  are  often  gauged  in  context  of  attitudes  of  normative  moralities.  Once  again,  the  conservative/liberal  divide  highlights  most  of  the  dominant  disagreements  on  the  matter.  Essentially,  ecclesiastical  arguments  over  homosexuality  attempt  to  determine  whether  it  is  a  sin  or  not  according  to  doctrine;  though  amongst  the  various  denominations  there  is  disagreement  as  to  whether  this  relates  to  the  homosexual  acts,  or  homosexual  attraction.  By  limiting  the  morality  of  sexuality  to  Aquinas'  Natural  Law,  arguments  limit  themselves  to  the  scientific  evidence  over  how  natural  a  method  of  sexuality  is.  Consequently,  many  arguments  over  the  natural  behavior  of  sexuality  are  often  made  analogous  to  behaviours  manifest  in  various  animal  species  (both  for  and  against).  Historically,  arguments  against  the  nature  of  homosexuality  are  aligned  with  'Edenic'  depictions  of  animals.  Alternatively,  anti-homosexual  arguments  draw  from  Darwinian  thought  suggesting  that  no  functional  advantage  can  be  gained  from  homosexual  behaviours  as  they  do  not  encourage  greater  chance  of  genetic  transference.  Similarly,  arguments  supporting  the  natural  state  of  homosexuality  cite  a  number  of  documented  research  exampling  homosexual  behaviour  in  animals.  Islamic  Scripture  and  Theology  In  attempting  to  understand  Islamic  thought  on  homosexuality,  some  context  must  be  given,  for  there  is  little  analogy  to  the  concept  of  homosexuality  as  an  identity  or  orientation  as  exists  in  western  culture.  Instead,  sexual  identity  is  related  more  closely  to  the  duality  of  masculine  and  feminine  roles,   quite  upset.  That  night  I  sent  an  email  to  the  department  trying  to  find  out  why  nobody  had  been  there.  As  it  turned  out  I  had  just  been  too  early.  So  I  tried  again  the  next  week.  This  time  I  waited  until  about  quarter  past  the  hour,  just  to  be  safe.  I  made  my  way  to  Applied  Science,  got  in  the  elevator  and  once  again  pressed  the  button  for  level  nine.  I  got  up  there  and  slowly  walked  to  Queer  Space.  This  time  the  door  was  open.  Not  many  people  showed  up  that  day  in  the  end  it  was  just  the  two  convenors,  one  other  girl  and  myself.  That  other  girl  turned  out  to  be  Sam,  who  would  eventually  become  the  current  lesbian  convenor.  On  this  particular  day  the  convenors  had  decided  to  try  and  screen  print  T-shirts  for  pride  week.  Tried  and  failed.  Side  note:  To  anyone  who  wants  to  screen  print  T-shirts  don't  use  your  hands  to  apply  the  paint.  It  doesn't  work.  So  that  was  my  first  experience  of  Queer  Space.  And  yes  like  a  lot  of  people  who  may  be  reading  this  I  was  terrified  to  do  it,  but  (excuse  me  while  I  get  sickeningly  corny)  it  was  one  of  the  best  things  I  ever  did  for  myself.  -  Mel  Step  by  Step:  How  to  get  to  Queer  Space:  Find  the  Applied  Science  Building.  Ignore  everyone  who  you  think  may  be  watching  you  and  knowing  what  your  doing,  trust  me  they  have  no  idea  that  Queer  Space  exists  let  alone  that  you,  one  particular  student  out  of  all  the  students  that  enter  that  building  are  heading  up  there.  Enter  the  building.  You  will  now  be  facing  three  lifts.  The  one  on  the  right  is  EXTREMELY  dodgy.  Don't  use  it.  Instead  you  want  to  go  into  either  the  one  on  your  left  or  the  one  in  the  middle.  These  lifts  often  take  a  while  to  get  down  to  the  ground  floor,  don't  worry,  you  can  use  this  time  to  calm  yourself  down  and  work  on  how  you  will  introduce  yourself.   These  are  the  lifts  remember  middle  or  left.  Once  in  the  lift  you  need  to  push  the  button  for  level  nine.  If  you're  nervous  about  this  part  the  best  way  to  do  it  just  to  ignore  everyone  else  in  the   lift,  push  it  quickly  and  lean  back  looking  frustrated  at  the  speed  of  the  lift.  Trust  me  you'll  fit  right  in.   For  those  who  don't  know  what  a  nine  looks  like.  By  the  way,  the  red  light  means  you  have  pushed  it.  Well  done.  When  you  get  up  to  level  nine  you  want  to  get  out  of  the  lift  and   turn  to  your  right.  Walk  down  the  end  of  the  hall  (at  this  point  you  should  have  already  seen  the  sign  with  the  arrow)  when  you  get  there  turn  right  again  and  walk  down  the  end  of  the  hall  (it's  a  very  short  hall).   Second  hallway,  the  short  one.  Queer  Space  is  the  last  door  on  the  right.  It  has  a  sign  that  says  Queer  Space.  If  you're  going  to  one  of  the  weekly  social  groups  the  door  should  already  be  open  for  you.  Door  to  Queer  Space   Walk  in  to  Queer  Space.  Relax,  have  some  food,  good  conversation  and  meet  some  great  people.  You  may  notice  that  I  have  not  included  a  picture  of  the  inside  of  Queer  Space...  I  have  to  give  you  something  to  look  forward  to....that  and  the  door  was  locked.  -  Mel   This  will  be  facing  you  when  you  walk  out  of  the  lift.  Like  the  sign  says,  turn  right.   This  is  the  first  hallway  you  must  walk  down. ",2006-09-01

"  Blood  libel   alive  and  well   JEROME  SOCOLOVSKY   LA  GUARDIA,  Spain  -  An  annual  fiesta  celebrating  the  local  patron  saint  has  invoked  the  story  of  el  Santo  Nino  de  la  Guardia  -  the  Holy  Child  of  La  Guardia  -  a  five-year-old  Christian  boy  who,  according  to  local  legend,  died  a  martyr's  death  in  1491.   The  priest  makes  no  mention  of  who  killed  the  boy.  But  a  woman  sit   ting  up  front  has  no  doubt  who  the  •  culprits  were.   “It  was  the  Jews,”  Milagros  Redajo  says  with  a  stern  look.  “They  abducted  him  and  brought  him  here  to  La  Guardia  and  did  to  him  what  they  had  done  to  Jesus:  they  crucified  him.”   Historians  say  the  story  of  the  Holy  Child  of  La  Guardia  is  not  just  a  myth;  it  derives  from  one  of  the  most  vile  antisemitic  slanders  of  medieval  Europe  -  the  blood  libel.   According  to  the  legend,  the  accused  allegedly  removed  the  child’s  heart  and  performed  a  ritual  with  a  communion  wafer  stolen  from  a  church  in  order  to  poison  the  Christian  population’s  water  supply.   A  plaque  on  the  wall  of  the  Her  mitage  of  the  Holy  Child,  on  the  side  of  a  mountain  next  to  La  Guardia,  reads:  “The  holy  innocent  child  from  Toledo,  patron  saint  of  this  town,  was  crucified  by  various  Jews  out  of  hatred  for  our  saviour,  Jesus  Christ.""  The  plaque  is  dated  September  1,2004.   An  estimated  30,000  Jews  live  in  Spain  today.  For  the  leadership  of  the  Jewish  community,  it’s  shocking  that  the  legend  survives.   “We  are  in  the  21st  century,  and  they’re  still  saying  that  the  Jews  killed  Christ,”  says  Jacques  Laredo,  secretary  of  the  Jewish  community  of  Madrid.  “We've  had  meetings  with  the  church,  but  they’ve  been  fruitless.”   Still,  Laredo  says  most  Jews  in  Spain  today  don’t  feel  threatened  by  what  goes  on  in  La  Guardia.   Last  year,  the  Spanish  Government  sponsored  the  55-nation  Conference  on  Antisemitism  and  Other  Forms  of   Intolerance,  held  in  Cordoba.   JTA ",2006-10-13
"  wm&amp;,   E   Lebanese,  Jewish  doctors  call  on  Howard  to  send  aid  to  Mid-East   MARK  FRANKLIN   JEWISH,  Lebanese  and  Muslim  doctors  have  called  on  Prime  Minis  ter  John  Howard  to  provide  humanitarian  and  medical  aid  to  the  victims  of  Israel’s  war  with  Hezbollah.   In  a  letter  to  Howard  last  week,  the  Australian  Christian,  Jewish  and  Muslim  Doctors  Alliance  con   demned  the  “continuing  loss  of  civilian  life;  of  children,  women  and  men  on  both  sides  of  the  Lebanese  and  Israeli  border”.   In  total,  130  doctors  signed  the   letter,  including  past  presidents  of  the  Royal  Australian  College  of  Sur  geons,  the  Australian  Medical  Asso  ciation  and  the  Royal  Australian  and  New  Zealand  College  of  Psychi   atrists.   One  of  several  Jewish  signato  ries,  Sydney  anaesthetist  Dr  Ron  Jones,  said:  “The  achievement  of  peace  transcends  politics  to  the  point  of  being  the  prime  objective.  Having  people  agree  on  a  compro  mise  is  the  secondary  objective.”   Melbourne  surgeon  Dr  Nabeel  Ibrahim,  an  Egyptian  Muslim,  launched  the  initiative.  Its  aim,  he   said,  was  to  show  the  government  that  Australians  care  deeply  about   the  humanitarian  crisis.   “We  know  the  cost  in  terms  of  human  life  and  also  we  know  the  cost  in  regard  to  what  it  takes  to  treat  and  rehabilitate  the  casualties,  the  injured  and  the  disabled,”  he  said.  “In  human  and  in  monetary  terms,  the  cost  is  astronomical.”   Another  signatory,  Dr  Hadia  Muktal,  is  a  Lebanese  Christian  who  arrived  in  Australia  in  1969  but  still   has  family  living  in  Beirut  and   southern  Lebanon.   She  told  the  AJN  that  her  aunt   died  in  the  war,  but  does  not  yet  know  how.  “It’s  very  hard  for  me,”   she  said.  “As  a  doctor  and  as  a  human  being,  I  find  war  terrorising  ...  my  cousins  who  I  spoke  to  in  Lebanon  were  terrified,  they’re  in   total  shock.”   The  doctors  had  not  received  a   response  to  the  letter  at  the  time  the  AJN  went  to  press.   Another  body,  the  Medical  Asso  ciation  for  the  Prevention  of  War,  Australia,  also  called  on  the  Federal  Government  to  help  with  the   humanitarian  crisis  earlier  this  month.

"  Why  we're  not  doing  ourselves  any  favours.   It's  a  simple  psychological  fact  that  humans  are  programmed  to  always  prefer  their  own  'group'  of  individuals  more  than  any  other.  It's  been  an  effective  survival  technique  over  millions  of  years;  we  seek  to  protect  and  care  for  ourselves  and  our  families,  and  either  ignore  or  actively  sabotage  our  enemies  or  those  different  to  us.  Millennia  of  wars  ought  to  demonstrate  this  simple  fact:  we  seek  to  take  resources  for  ourselves,  or  attempt  to  force  others  to  our  own  way  of  life.  Survival  has  demanded  this  selfishness  from  us,  and  it's  essentially  ingrained  into  our  human  psyche.  By  nature,  we  will  protect  those  close  to  us  and  abhor  those  different.  Therefore,  if  we  as  a  queer  community  want  to  be  'accepted'  and  'equal'  and  a  part  of  the  overall  community,  if  we  want  to  be  defended  and  helped  as  any  other  member  of  society,  our  role  must  be  to  emphasize  what  we  have  in  common  with  the  rest  of  society,  rather  than  what  sets  us  apart.  Clearly,  we  have  a  right  to  be  queer,  and  we  have  a  right  to  state  that  we  are  so,  and  we  have  a  right  to  be  taken  as  equals.  Until  such  time  as  this  is  the  case,  necessarily  we  will  stand  up  for  our  rights.  But  there's  a  difference  between  being  gay  and  making  it  our  defining  characteristic.  If  we  define  ourselves  firstly  as  gay  and  secondly  as  members  of  our  community,  we're  effectively  acting  to  isolate  ourselves.  If  we  demand  to  be  different,  we  are  no  longer  part  of  that  wider  community,  and  we  lose  the  right  to  be  seen  as  part  of  that  wider  group.  It  antagonizes  the  essential  survival  instinct,  and  it  engenders  resentment.  This  is  why  queer  events  like  the  gay  games  don't  do  us  any  favours.  They  raise  the  profile  of  gays,  that's  fine.  But  they  also  set  us  apart  as  a  group  to  be  measured  by  different  standards  and  in  different  ways.  Frankly  I  see  it  as  a  celebration  of  mediocrity  -  athletes  who  can't  make  it  in  the  real  Olympics  will  perform  in  the  gay  games,  and  be  rewarded  for  it,  but  what  does  it  really  achieve?  Being  gay   doesn't  change  your  ability  to  run  or  swim  fast,  it  changes  your  sexual  preference,  and  that  is  all.  But  if  we  make  being  gay  a  general  statement  about  our  lifestyle  and  identity,  we  make  ourselves  another  group  in  society  to  stand  against,  whom  the  majority  can  view  with  suspicion  and  dislike.  Only  by  emphasising  our  similarities  can  we  expect  to  be  embraced.  By  this  argument,  the  Mardi  Gras  too  is  outdated  and  antagonistic.  But  I  find  this  less  offensive,  if  only  because  it  raises  the  issues  of  the  equality  we  do  not  receive  and  the  things  we  are  denied.  It  is  a  celebration  of  both  our  diversity  and  our  sameness,  a  recognition  that  we  are  different  in  some  ways  but  seek  the  same  things  as  many  heterosexuals.  And  anything  that  raises  our  rights  within  the  community  cannot  be  a  bad  thing.  But  at  the  end  of  the  day,  we  are  not  doing  ourselves  any  favours  by  isolating  ourselves.  And  while  homosexuals  will  spend  all  their  time  complaining  about  how  oppressed  they  are  by  their  heterosexual  peers,  at  the  same  time  they  act  to  reject  those  heterosexuals.  While  gays  act  as  revolted  by  straight  sex  as  heterosexuals  are  by  gay  sex,  they're  actively  increasing  the  problem.  Again,  they  act  to  isolate  themselves  instead  of  to  merge,  making  a  big  deal  of  the  difference  they  want  heterosexuals  to  ignore.  And  that's  not  only  working  against  their  own  cause,  it's  downright  hypocritical.  Essentially,  if  we  want  to  be  accepted  in  the  wider  community  and  have  the  rights  thereof,  we  have  to  act  as  part  of  that  community.  Isolation  and  solipsism  work  far  more  against  our  cause  than  our  simple  sexual  orientation;  it's  about  how  we  portray  ourselves  and  relate  to  others.  And  until  we  can  consider  ourselves  a  part  of  the  community,  gay  or  otherwise,  no  one  else  is  going  to.   Georgia  Carthey   and  various  acts  that  are  either  in  harmony  with  the  Qur'an  or  against  them.  Like  Christianity,  Islam  refers  to  a  singular  central  text  of  scripture,  the  Qur'an.  There  are  certain  references  in  the  Qur'an  that  are  central  to  Islamic  thought  on  homosexuality  (all  references  are  from  the  Abdullah  Yusuf  Ali  translation):  Suras  7:80-81  ,  26:  165-175  ,  27:  55-58  .  From  the  above  Suras  there  is  clear  scriptural  denouncement  of  homosexual  practices  and  unlike  Christian  thought  (where  there  is  certain  ambiguity)  Islamic  moral  and  legal  thought,  in  the  form  of  shari'ah,  holds  a  strong  consensus  that  outright  condemns  homosexual  acts.  In  general  terms,  what  is  proscribed  is  not  the  desire,  but  rather  a  list  of  illicit  sexual  behaviours;  such  acts  are  considered  a  corruption  of  the  divine  order  established  by  Allah  .  Homosexuality  in  Islamic  History  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  unlike  Christian  interpretations  there  is  no  scriptural  description  of  homosexual  orientation,  the  focus  is  exclusively  on  homosexual  acts  and  primarily  between  males  .  In  this,  Islam  texts  share  an  affinity  with  Christian  texts  as  both  provide  little  in  the  way  of  commentary  on  lesbian  relationships.  The  scholars  Dunne  and  El-Rouayheb  suggest  that  the  relationship  of  Islamic  culture  to  homosexuality  is  an  extension  of  Islamic  thinking  on  male  and  female  roles.  They  opine  that  there  is  evidence  to  suggest  that  attraction  towards  young  men  is  natural,  but  the  acts  of  intercourse  with  them  are  proscribed  .  Dunne,  in  particular,  focuses  on  the  cultural  symbolism  of  the  role  of  the  penetrator  in  any  sexual  act.  He  considers  this  to  be  a  reflection  of  a  deeply  patriarchal  society  and  that  the  veneration  of  the  masculine  is  rooted  in  Islam  and  the  shari'ah.  Dunne  suggests  that  in  the  early  history  of  Islamic  countries,  there  were  often  social  cul-de-sacs  that  were  permissive  of  homosexual  behavior  within  certain  contexts,  and  portrays  early  Islamic  nations  where  homosexual  behaviour  was  socially  accepted  within  these  contexts.  The  social  realities,  he  suggests,  were  a  deliberate  contradiction  of  normative  moralities.  He  describes  scenarios  where  male  prostitutes  and  other  same-sex  practices  were  acceptable  outlets  for  men  without  access  to  licit  forms  of  sexual  engagement.  El-Rouayheb  makes  similar  claims,  suggesting  that  chaste  pederastic  love  affairs  were  commonly  accepted,  but  ameliorated  after  the  1800s  from  the  influence  of  Western  Victorian  attitudes  .  Modern  Islamic  Attitudes  The  large  majority  of  Islamic  nations  are  theocracies  under  Islamic  Law.  In  the  nations  of  Saudi  Arabia,  Iran,  Mauritania,  Sudan,  Somalia,  Somaliland  and  Yemen,  homosexual  intercourse  carries  a  death  sentence;  and  formerly  in  Afghanistan.  In  other  Muslim  nations  such  as  Bahrain,  Qatar,  Algeria  and  the  Maldives,  the  punishment  is  corporal  punishment,  detention  or  fines.  In  other  predominantly  Muslim  countries  like  Jordan,  Egypt,  Turkey  or  Mali,  homosexuality  is  not  explicitly  forbidden  but  may  occasionally  be  prosecuted  by  public  morality  laws.  Such  divergence  demonstrates  that  while  there  is  a  general  proscription,  there  is  often  divergence  on  how  to  punish  the  act  as  different  schools  on  Islamic  law  differ  on  their  interpretations  of  sharia.  This  is  not  to  say  that  liberal  interpretations  do  not  exist,  more  that  the  legal  suppression  of  gay  rights  movements  in  these  Islamic  nations  means  there  is  little  opportunity  for  legitimate  activism.  It  is  argued  here  that  the  lack  of  propagation  of  liberal  attitudes  in  Islamic  nations  (compared  to  predominantly  Christian  nations)  finds  origin  in   the  lack  of  an  'Islamic  reformation'  that  has  secularised  Islamic  thought.  However,  it  must  be  acknowledged  that  part  of  this  lies  in  the  highly  theocratic  ideal  structured  in  Islamic  thought.  There  is  a  strong  correlation  between  Islamic  social  tolerances  of  homosexuality  (as  opposed  to  doctrinal)  in  nations  that,  while  predominantly  Muslim,  are  in  practice  secular.  Conclusions  We  can  see  that  Islam  shares  many  of  the  'normative  moralities'  that  Christian  theology  holds.  Both  have  conservative  and  liberal  attitudes  that  proscribe  and  tolerate  homosexuality  respectively.  The  major  differences  reflect  divergences  of  historical  cultures,  rather  than  doctrinal  attitudes;  with  an  emphasis  on  orientation  in  Christian  thinking,  and  gender  roles  in  Islamic  cultures.  As  a  correlation,  both  religions'  primary  denouncements  are  directed  towards  male  oriented  homosexuality.  It  can  be  surmised  from  these  commonalities  and  from  theological  attitudes  that  a  strong  aspect  in  both  these  churches  is  a  denouncement  of  homosexuality  weakening  of  their  doctrinal  definitions  of  masculinity.  That  these  ecclesiastic  institutes  are  structured  theologically,  socially  and  clerically  upon  patriarchal  authority,  the  denigration  of  homosexuality  can  be  attributed,  in  part,  to  the  perception  that  homosexuality  weakens  that  patriarchal  authority.

"  Kosher  carollers  bring   Yiddishkeit  to  Yuletide   NICOLE  BRESKIN   TWO  day’s  before  lighting  their  chanukiah,  three  Jewish  sisters  found  themselves  in  the  unusual  position  of  performing  Christmas  carols  onstage  at  Sydney’s  City  Recital  Hall  Angel  Place  last  week.   While  Miriam,  Adela  and  Sarah  Green  baum,  all  current  or  former  students  at  the  Emanuel  School,  are  more  accustomed  to  singing  Chanukah  songs  at  this  time  of  year,  the  trio  took  part  in  the  annual  Sydney  Chil  dren’s  Choir  (SCC)  performance  of  Christ  mas  carols,  titled  Voices  of  Angels.   The  Greenbaums  are  not  the  only  Jewish  members  of  the  230-strong  choir,  but  were  the  only  ones  to  participate  in  this  year’s   carols.   In  a  repertoire  that  included  Silent  Night,  The  First  Noel  and  Hark!  The  Herald  Angels  Sing,  Sarah  Greenbaum,  15,  said  her  favourite  was  the  inclusion  of  a  Chanukah  blessing.   “Hanerot  Hallalu  was  my  favourite,”  said  Sarah,  who  now  attends  St  George  Girls  High.  “The  Christmas  [carols],  like  Silent  Night,  are  just  songs  to  me,  but  they  don’t  mean  any  thing  [religious]...  The  Chanukah  one  we  can  relate  to  more  because  there’s  some  history.”   SCC  artistic  director  Lyn  Williams  told  the  AJN:  “We  recognise  that  there  are  celebrations  at  this  time  of  the  year  other  than  Christian  celebrations  and  wanted  to  acknowledge  that  in  the  repertoire  that  we  sing.

The  Greenbaums,  who  describe  them  selves  as  traditional,  regularly  attend  services  at  South  Sydney  Synagogue  and  light  Shabbat  candles  every  week.   The  youngest  Greenbaum,  Deborah,  a  Year  3  Emanuel  School  student,  also  qualified  for  the  choir,  but  opted  out  in  favour  of  after  school  gymnastics  practice.

"  Safrans  guide  to  unexpected  Zionists   White   supremacists,  Satanists  and  Palestinians  -   hardly  the  most  pro-Israel  lovers   on  the  planet,  right?  Wrong.   JOHN  SAFRAfil  offers  this  guide  to  unexpected  -  and  perplexing  -  Zionists.   WHEN  I  used  to  watch  Sale  of   the  Century  with  my  grand  ma  she’d  say,  “Tony  Barber  is  a  good  man.  He’s  a  friend  of  Israel.”   Friends  of  Israel  can  be  found  in  unusual  locales.  I  once  met  a  West  Papuan  in  exile  in  Australia.  He  said  he  stopped  turning  up  to  “Free  West  Papua”  protests  because  inevitably  they  would  segue  from  berating  Indonesia  to  slagging  off  America  and  Israel.  This  upset  him  because,  he  told  me,  ever  since  he’d  been  a  tyke  hunt  ing  wild  pig  with  a  spear  in  the  West  Papuan  jungle,  he  had  loved  Israel.   Game  show  hosts  and  PNG  pig  hunters  aside,  you’d  have  to  be  living  under  a  rock,  or  perhaps  in  a  bomb  shelter,  not  to  notice  a  lot  of  people  crossing  Israel  off  their  Chanukah  card  list  Nevertheless,  you  can  still  find  Zionists  in  some  pretty  unexpect  ed  places.   •WHFTE  SUPREMACISTS   FOR  ZIONISM   THE  British  National  Party  (BNP)  is  a  far-right  group  headed  by  Holocaust  -  denier  Nick  Griffin.  They  caused  shockwaves  in  the  White  Power  world  a  few  years  back  by  announcing  they  couldn’t  be  bothered  hating  Jews  any   more.  Their  rationale:  there  are  so  few   Jews  in  England  it  was  a  bit  like  invest  ing  energy  in  loathing  the  Amish.   Besides,  they  hated  Arabs  more.  White  European  Jews  were  even  told  they  could  join,  although  you  had  to  be  assimilated  -  so  no  turning  up  to  meetings  in  a  shtreimel.  And  tuck  in  your  tzitzit  for  God’s  sake.   The  BNP  even  flouted  the  conven  tional  White  Power  wisdom  on  Zion  ism.  They  respected  Israelis’  sense  of  nationalism  and  admired  its  firm  hand  in  dealings  with  the  Arabs.  On  the  current  conflict  in  Lebanon,  BNP  legal  adviser  Lee  Barnes  says,  “It  is  in  our  long-term  interests  that  Hezbol  lah  are  ground  into  dust  by  Israel  as  that  way  we  don’t  have  to  do  it  in  the   future.”   worked  with  Fatah  bomb-makers  and  served  time  in  a  Jerusalem  jail  for  try  ing  to  lynch  an  Israeli  soldier.   Later,  his  parents  sent  him  to  America  for  a  college  education,  where  he  met  a  Christian  woman.  While  trying  to  convert  her  to  his  Islamic  faith,  he  read  the  Christian  and  Jewish  scriptures  and  decided  it  was  he  who  had  it  all  wrong,  particu  larly  in  regard  to  the  Jews:  they  had  a  biblical  claim  to  all  of  Eretz  Yisrael.  He   Game  show  hosts  and  PNG  pig  hunters  aside,  you'd  have  to  be  living  under  a  rock,  or  perhaps  in  a  bomb   shelter,  not  to  notice  a  lot  of  people  crossing  Israel  off   their  Chanukah  card  list.   Barnes  also  complains  about  media  coverage  of  the  conflict:  “The  obvious  agenda  for  the  media  is  to  assist  in  ending  nationalism  as  an  ide  ology  and  the  destruction  of  national   ist  states  like  Israel.”   I  don’t  want  to  tell  anyone  how  to  run  their  white-supremacist  move  ment  but  when  you’re  complaining  that  the  Jews  don’t  control  the  media,  maybe  it’s  time  to  go  back  to  skinhead   school.   •  PALESTINIANS   FOR  ZIONISM   IT’S  the  age-old  question.  What’s  worse:  sitting  on  a  plane  next  to  a  ter  rorist  with  a  bomb  or  sitting  on  a  plane  next  to  a  Christian  trying  to  push  Jesus  on  you  for  two  hours?   Walid  Shoebat  embodies  this   conundrum.  The  Palestinian  spent  his  formative  years  as  a  PLO  terrorist  He   became  a  Christian  and  a  Zionist   But  not  just  any  Zionist  The  most  Zionist  Zionist  in  the  history  of  Zion.  Even  Herzl  would  have  told  him  to   chill  out  a  bit.  Even  Moshe  Dayan  would  had  rolled  his  eye.  He  went  on  lecture  tours  across  America  constant  ly  conflating  Palestinians  with  Nazis  and  asking  the  Jews  in  the  audience  to  “please  take  back  the  holy  Temple   Mount”.   If  anyone  questions  the  power  of  Topol,  take  note  of  Shoebat,  who  was  asked  how  he  deprogrammed  himself  of  the  antisemitism  beaten  into  him  since  he  was  a  child:  “I  began  with  Fid  dler  on  the  Roof?  he  said.  “I  watched  it   over  350  times.”   •  SATANISTS  FOR  ZIONISM   ANTON  LaVey  founded  The  Church  of  Satan  in  the  1960s,  its  philosophy  laid  down  in  The  Satanic  Bible.  LaVey  had  the  black  cape  and  pointy  beard   and  sometimes  even  strapped  on  horns.  But  for  all  the  posturing  with  pentagrams  and  potions,  The  Satanic  Bible  was  really  a  polemic  against  the  wimpy  passivity  of  Christianity  and,  by  extension,  the  nebbish  aspects  ol   Judaism.   The  flipside  of  this  was  he  support  ed  Zionism.  His  wife,  Blanche  Barton,  wrote  that  he  became  involved  in  mil  itant  Israeli  groups  in  San  Francisco  in  the  late  1940s,  smuggling  guns  to  the  Stem  Gang  and  Irgun  in  the  fledgling  Jewish  State.   According  to  LaVey,  Dayan’s  son  Assaf  read  The  Satanic  Bible.  “He  was   glowing  about  the  book,  agreed  with  everything  in  it.  He  said  it  was  exactly  the  philosophy  they  practised,  were  forced  to  practise,  in  modem  Israel,”  said  LaVey.   In  his  last  book  before  his  death  in  1997,  LaVey  claimed  The  Church  of  Satan  was  the  only  home  for  you  if  you  were  both  a  Zionist  and  an  Odin   ist.   So  should  Jewish  supporters  of  Israel  embrace  white  supremacists,  former  PLO  terrorists  and  Satanists?   In  times  of  unprecedented  hostility,  will  any  friends  of  Israel  do?   Can  schnorrers  be  choosers?  I’m  not  sure,  but  I  do  know  that  Blue  Box  collection  time  would  be  a  lot  more  interesting  if  people  in  Klan  hoods  and  devil  outfits  turned  up  bashing  on  your  door  instead  of  the  usual  JNF   folk.

"  Tempers  flare  over  church  firecrackers   DAN  BARON   NAZARETH  -  It  only  takes  a  few  loose  screws  to  throw  Israel’s  delicate  inter  ethnic  mechanism  out  of  whack.   After  years  of  claiming  they  were  abused  by  the  country’s  social  services,  an  impoverished  and  eccentric  Israeli  family  took  welfare  protests  to  a  new  level  last  Friday  by  staging  an  attack  on  one  of  Christianity’s  holiest  sites.   Haim  Eliahu  Havivi  and  his  Chris  tian  wife,  Violette,  accompanied  by  their  daughter  Odelia,  20,  entered  the   Basilica  of  the  Annunciation  in   Nazareth,  pushing  a  baby  stroller  that  they  had  loaded  with  firecrackers  and  gas  canisters.   No  one  was  seriously  hurt  in  the  ensuing  pyrotechnic  display,  but  it  sent  shockwaves  through  the  mostly  Arab  city,  whose  residents  have  been  wary  of  Jewish  violence  since  an  off-duty  sol  dier  went  on  a  shooting  spree  last  year,  according  to  a  church  clergyman.   “The  worshipers  thought  it  was  a  terrorist  attack  and  scattered,”  Father  John  Muscat  said.   Before  the  truth  could  be  deter  mined,  thousands  of  angry  locals  con  verged  on  the  shrine,  as  did  scores  of  riot  police.   The  would-be  lynch  mob  was  beat  en  back,  and  several  of  its  ringleaders  were  injured.  A  police  patrol  car  was   torched.   Throughout,  a  lightly  injured  Havivi  and  his  family  remained  under  guard  in  the  grotto  until  they  could  be   spirited  away  to  a  safe  lock-up,  dis  guised  as  policemen.   “I  have  nothing  against  Christians,”  Havivi,  43,  told  investigators.   Indeed,  his  wife  is  a  Christian,  a  fact  that,  for  many  of  Israel’s  Arab  citizens,  should  have  taken  some  of  the  sting  out  of  the  incident.  So  should  the  feet   that  the  couple  had  for  years  mounted  spectacular  demonstrations  in  a  bid  to  recover  three  children  they  said  had  been  unfairly  taken  into  state  custody.   But  on  Saturday,  several  thousand  took  part  in  a  protest  march  in  Nazareth  that  was  led  by  Israeli  Arab   lawmakers.

"  The  fallout  from  Mel  Gibson’s  drunken  tirade  is  a  true  indication   of  the  suppressed  anger  of  many  who  had  been  so  badly  bruised  by  a  Hollywood  star  who  just  did  not  know  when  to  stop,  argues   DON  PERLGUT.   The  at  times  gleeful  Response  to  Mel's   ilrunken  verbal  abuse  is  not  just  about  taking  down  a  tall  poppy.   THERE  are  a  few  very  impor   tant  lessons  from  the  contro  versy  over  Mel  Gibson’s  recent  antisemitic  comments.  If  you  have  missed  it,  the  key  words  were  Mel’s  remarks  to  the  arresting  officer,  James  Mee  (who,  it  turns  out,  actually  is  Jewish):  “F***ing  Jews”,  “The  Jews  are  responsible  for  all  the  wars  in  the  world”,  and  “Are  you  a  Jew?”   Now,  I  actually  don’t  think  Mel  Gibson  is  a  bad  man.  People  who  know  him  report  him  to  be  funny,  playful,  generous  and,  well,  yes,  ultra  conservative  and  paranoid.   But  there  are  contradictions:  he  is  reported  to  be  homophobic,  but  he  hires  gays;  he  may  be  antisemitic,  but  he  still  hires  Jews  and  has  lots  of  Jewish  friends.  The  next  film  which  his  Aus  tralian  distribution  company  Icon  released  in  Australia  after  The  Passion  of  the  Christ  in  2004  was  Wondrous  Oblivion,  a  touching  British  film  about  cricket,  racism  and...  antisemitism.   Others  will  (and  in  fact,  are)  having  a  field  day  psychoanalysing  Mel’s  motives  and  background.  He  appears  to  be  a  product  of  a  very  conservative  and  antisemitic  childhood  (his  Holo  caust-denier  father  Hutton)  combined  with  the  insularity  and  lack  of  aware  ness  which  extensive  fame,  talent  and  excessive  amounts  of  money  can  bring.   As  Michael  Gawenda  pointed  out  in  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald  this   Mel  Gibson  (right),  directing  77»e  Passion  of  the  Christ.   Photo:  AJN  file   week,  Mel  is  actually  a  common  Proto  cob  of  the  Elders  of  Zion-type  of  anti  semite  rather  than  a  theological  Christian  antisemite.  He  didn’t  ask  James  Mee  if  he  was  a  Christ-ldller;  he  just  accused  him  of  running  the  world.   Gibson’s  film  The  Passion  of  the  Christ  was  wildly  successful  -  grossing   more  than  $US370  million  in  the  US  alone.  This  was  due  to  a  number  of   factors,  including  remarkably  high  production  values  (hate  his  politics,  but  he’s  a  good  director),  exquisite  timing  in  a  post-9/11  political  envi  ronment,  but  mostly  an  outstandingly  targeted  and  executed  publicity  and  marketing  campaign.   A  large  part  of  the  marketing  was  the  unprecedented  publicity  about  the   antisemitic  nature  of  the  film.  The  implicit  tag  line  to  “see  the  film  the  Jews  don’t  want  you  to  see”  directly  pandered  to  the  admitted  antisemitic  prejudices  of  right-wing  Catholics  and  Evangelical  Protestants.   A  survey  by  the  Pew  Research  Cen  tre  dearly  showed  that  American  view  ers  of  the  film  were  much  more  likely  to  believe  that  “the  Jews  were  responsi  ble  for  Christ’s  death”  (a  stand-in  for  antisemitic  feelings)  than  those  who   did  not  see  the  film.   Mel  willingly  partidpated  in  and  actively  encouraged  systematic  attacks  on  his  film’s  critics  and  this  “Jew-bait  ing”  (for  that’s  what  it  was).  And  some  important  journalists  and  American  Jewish  leaders  —  most  notably  Abra  ham  Foxman  (Anti-Defamation  League),  Rabbi  Martin  Hier  (Simon  Wiesenthal  Centre)  and  Rabbi  Eric  Yoffee  (Union  for  Reform  Judaism)  -  took  the  bait,  feeding  the  willing  media  frenzy.   Why  the  controversy  never  took  off  here  in  Australia  appears  to  be  due  in  part  to  a  lack  of  the  same  Evangelical  Christian  base,  no  “George  Bush”  fac  tor  of  a  polarised  red  state/blue  state  electorate  and  the  unwillingness  of   almost  all  Australian  Jewish  and  Chris  tian  leaders  to  participate  in  the  Amer  ican-style  free-for-all.  The  Australian  media  -  always  looking  for  a  good  fight  -  never  found  it  locally  with  this  film.  And  Mel  —  possibly  sensing  that  such  flagrant  antisemitic  commentary   would  not  be  welcomed  here  -  avoid  ed  Australia  during  the  film’s  market  ing  campaign.   The  at  times  gleeful  response  to  Mel’s  drunken  verbal  abuse  is  not  just  about  taking  down  a  tall  poppy  (for  Americans  don’t  really  like  that  sort  of  thing),  but  a  true  indication  of  the  suppressed  anger  by  many  who  had  been  so  badly  bruised  by  a  Hollywood  star  who  just  did  not  know  when  to  stop.  Not  then,  and  not  now.   Don  Perlgut  is  the  film  critic  for  the  Australian  Jewish  News  and  is  currently  writing  a  PhD  at  Macquarie  University,   which  includes  a  case  study  of   The  Passion  of  the  Christ.

"  Album  Review:  Electric  Six  -  ""Switzerland""  -  Inertia  Records  -  •  •  :  -  —   ?   I  really  love  Electric  Six.  I  loved  them  when  I  first  heard  them,  and  they've  never  disappointed  me  since.  If  I  could  write  and  listen  to  music  at  the  same  time,  I  would  be  listening  to  them  right  now.  Th  eir  first  EP,  ""Fire"",  was  staggeringly  original;  their  second,  ""Senor  Smoke"",  was  a  follow-up  of  such  consistently  high-quality  throughout  that  its  comparatively  modest  air-play  stunned  me.  Then  I  remembered  that  eighty-five  percent  of  air-play  is  devoted  to  rap  and  R&amp;B.  There  are  two  kinds  of  rap:  one  involves  an  angry-sounding  person  promoting  a  lifestyle  devoted  to  unashamed  violence,  misogyny,  materialism,  and  anti-intellectualism.  The  other  kind  is  produced  by  people  who  aren't  smart  enough  to  do  even  this  properly,  but  try  anyway.  This  rap  sounds,  to  any  person  of  normal  intelligence,  like  an  idiot  attempting  to  sound  like  an  intimidating  idiot,  all  the  while  oblivious  to  the  fact  that  the  army  are  testing  dangerous  new  audio-based  weaponry  only  metres  from  their  head.  As  for  modern-day  R&amp;B,  it  has  taken  fifty  years  of  computing  knowledge  to  twist  what  is  to  begin  with  unbelievably  moronic  ""music""  into  a  form  of  sound  almost  as  stupid  as  the  people  who  deliberately  listen  to  it  for  pleasure.  But  I  digress.   If  someone  had  approached  me  before  I  had  ever  heard  Electric  Six  and  described  their  genre  as  a  blend  of  Disco,  Punk,  Funk,  Metal,  New-Wave,  Glam-Rock  and  Dance,  I  would  probably  have  said,  ""Whatever,  Christian  Brimo"".  But,  had  he  said  that,  Christian  would  have  been  right.  How  this  band  has  managed  to  create  a  brilliant  new  sound  out  of  this  unholy  jumble  of  apparent  influences  is  beyond  me  —  this  music  should  sound  like  shit.  But  it  really,  really  doesn't.  ""Switzerland""  is  another  classic  album,  not  only  for  its  original  and  varied  music,  but  for  its  lyrics.  Sharp  and  deliberate  in  their  construction,  they  can  be  political,  philosophical,  hilarious,  and  empowering  in  a  way  that  makes  you  want  to  thrust  your  hips  and  head  for  the  nearest  dance-oriented  establishment  with  a  bounce  in  your  step.  Whenever  these  guys  are  planning,  God  willing,  to  tour  Australia  again,  it  won't  be  soon  enough  —  I  don't  care  if  they  seem  to  have  a  new  line-up  every  time  I  check  their  website.  This  release  almost  makes  up  for  the  fact  that  Inertia  is  also  Ben  Lee's  record  label.  Electric  Six  may  be  one  of  the  best  bands  in  the  world,  but  even  they  will  never  be  as  good  as  Ben  Lee  is  bad.   Patrick  Coyte ",2006-10-20

The  Christian  messianic  group  has  been  distributing  a  leaflet  that  states  “Jackie  Mason  -  A  Jew  for  Jesus?!”  and  has  also  published  it  via  its  website  for  downloading.  Mason  himself  is  a  former  rabbi,  his  grandfather  and  father  were  rabbis,  and  his  brothers  are  also  tab   dis.  i  am  as  Jewish  as  a  matzah  bail  or  kosher  salami,  the  75-year-old  comedian  said  in  documents  filed  in  court  in  Manhattan.   Basking  in  the  media  attention,  Jews  for  Jesus  has  denied  the  charges,  while  trying  to  muscle  in  on  Mason’s  I  act  “Jackie  may  be  as  Jewish  as  a   I  matzah  ball,  but  Jesus  is  as  Jewish  as  I  chicken  soup,”  said  Jews  for  Jesus  I  executive  director  David  Brickner.

"  SHMOOZE   ¥   FUNNY,  HE   DIDN’T  LOOK  IT...   MOST  Jews  cherish  the  memory  of  the  late  Pope  John  Paul  II  for  his  conciliatory  attitude  to  Jews  and  his  historic  2000  visit  to  Israel,  but  now  a  Manchester  his  torian  is  taking  things  one  big  step  further  by  claiming  that  the  Pope  was  -  not  to  put  too  fine  a  point  on  it  -  halachically  Jewish.  As  reported  by  Manchester’s  Metmnews,  historian  Yaakov  Wise  says  his  study  into  the  maternal  ancestry  of  Karol  Josez  Wojtyla  (John  Paul  Il’s  real  name)  has  revealed  that  the  late  Pope's  mother,  grandmother  and  great-grand  mother  were  all  probably  Jewish  and  came  from  a  small  town  not  far  from  Krakow.   “It  would  also  explain  why  this  Pope  in  particular  felt  a  strong  desire  to  improve  relations  between  the  Church  of  Rome  and  the  Jewish  people,”  Wise  said,  in  a  bit  of  understatement  And  we  are  reminded,  of  course,  that  there  is  a  great  Christian  tradition  of  being  Jewish  ...

"  Jews,  Anglicans  to  open  historic  dialogue   THE  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  will  meet  with  Australia’s  Anglican  leadership  for  the  first  time  this  Monday  in  an  effort  to  initiate  dialogue  between  the  two  communities.   Although  the  Jewish  community  has  ongoing  dialogues  with  other  Christian  denominations,  next  week’s  meeting  will  be  the  first  between  senior  Jewish  and  Anglican  representatives.   ECAJ  president  Grahame  Leonard  said:  “The  whole  idea  of  these  ongoing  dialogues  is  to  further  and  deepen  the  understanding  between  the  two  belief  systems,  to  gain  resect  for  one  another  and  to  have  open  communication  channels  so  that  if  and  when  issues  do  arise  we  can  discuss  them  as  friends.”   The  British  Anglican  Church  recently  caused  outrage  among  British  Jews  when  its   general  synod  voted  to  divest  from  compa  nies  that  it  said  support  Israel’s  occupation  of  Palestinian  land.  Australia's  Anglican  church  was  quick  to  distance  itself  from  the   move.   Rabbi  Levi  led  a  delegation  of  religious  leaders  from  various  faiths  to  Israel  last  month.  It  included  Anglican  Reverend  David  Richardson,  dean  of  St  Paul’s  Cathedral  in  Melbourne. ",2006-04-21

"  ‘New’  Ron  Arad  video  to  air?   JERUSALEM  -  A  leading  Lebanese  television  sta  tion  announced  this  week  that  it  would  broadcast  a  video  clip  next  week  showing  miss  ing  Israeli  Air  Force  navi   gator  Ron  Arad  (pictured).   The  LBC  station,  associated  with  Lebanon’s  Christian  community,  claimed  the  footage,  which  will  also  include  Arad's  voice,  would  be  an  international  scoop.  It   did  not  elaborate.   The  promotional  clip  showed  a  man  who  very  much  resembled  Arad,  though  it  could  not  immediately  be  confirmed  that  it  indeed  was  him.  But  Arad’s  family  later  concluded  that  the  person  shown  in  the  video  was  the  missing  navigator.

"  Davao  Diversions   Verdant  coral  islands  mirrored  in  placid  seas,  virgin  forests  nurturing  rare  wildlife,  a  legend-laden  mountain  peak,  moss  dotted  plantations  dripping  with  vibrantly  coloured  orchids,  indigenous  people  proudly  showcasing  their  traditional  cultures  ...  such  idyllic  enticements  contribute  to  the  lure  of  Davao.  Located  on  the  southeast  corner  of  the  orchid-shaped  island  of  Mindanao,  the  second  largest  of  the  Philippine  islands,  Davao  actually  claims  to  be  the  largest  city  on  the  planet  if  its  geographic  boundaries  are  taken  into  consideration.  The  provincial  capital's  2440  sq  km  are  spread  over  a  huge  rural  area  though  some  80  per  cent  of  the  city's  real  estate  is  actually  agricultural  land  or  forest.  Davaoenyos  come  from  Christian,  Muslim  and  Chinese  communities  and  various  indigenous  tribes.  It's  a  harmonious  juxtaposition  of  Christian  and  Islamic  cultures  infused  with  strong  indigenous  influences  that  gives  Davao  its  unique  character.  The  best  place  to  gain  an  insight  into  the  city's  complex  cultural  tapestry  is  in  the  Davao  Museum.  A  stand  out  display  here  is  a  grouping  of  brass  ceremonial  gongs  used  in  a  four  day  frenzy  of  feasting  and  drinking  balabba,  or  sugar  cane  wine.   The  end  of  festivities  to  honour  gods  and  appease  demons  was  marked  with  human  sacrifice,  a  grisly  practice  that  remained  until  1886.  (Today  chickens  get  the  chop  at  the  end  of  the  still  celebrated  festival!)  Three  museum  galleries  contain  the  material  culture  of  some  15  tribes  known  to  have  lived  in  the  area.  (Only  seven  tribes  still  remain.)  Though  the  museum's  collection  of  traditional  weaving  is  broad,  it,  by  definition,  is  static.  The  daily  display  of  weaving  at  the  T'boli  Weaving  Centre,  in  contrast,  is  very  animated  as  I  was  able  to  learn  about  ethnic  crafts  from  a  gracious  tribal  woman  as  she  used  a  back  strap  loom  to  transform  abaca  fibres  into  tinalak  or  indigenous  fabric  woven  with  striking  patterns.  Several  stalls  sheltering  skilled  weavers  are  clustered  in  one  quadrant  of  the  well  landscaped  grounds  of  the  Waterfront  Insular,  the  city's  first  international  standard  hotel.  In  additional  to  its  cultural  offerings,  two  more  good  reasons  to  make  Davao  a  holiday  base  are  quality  dining  and  inexpensive  shopping.  The  menu  speciality  at  upmarket  resorts  and  friendly  cafes  is  fresh  seafood  with  lobster  and  tuna  getting  the  nod  from  discerning  diners.  And   while  Davao  is  not  a  duty  free  paradise,  distinctive  items  abound  from  ethnic  arts  and  crafts  to  Muslim  brassware.  Not  all  of  the  action  is  in  the  city.  A  clutch  of  swank  resorts  dot  a  portion  of  the  calm  coastline  of  Samal  Island,  a  301  sq  km  retreat  just  700  metres  across  the  Davao  Gulf  from  the  busy  city.  With  its  string  of  beach  resorts  and  seaside  restaurants,  Samal  Island  caters  to  long  staying  visitors  and  day  trippers  alike  as  the  isle  is  just  a  10  minute  outrigger  ride  from  Davao.  Back  in  the  city  it's  impossible  to  overlook  San  Pedro  (St  Peter's)  Cathedral.  Facing  the  Centennial  Monument  of  Peace,  the  curious  structure  with  Christian  and  Muslim  architectural  influences  was  constructed  in  the  shape  of  a  boat  to  tribute  the  Apostle  fisherman,  St  Peter.  Not  far  away  from  a  miniscule  enclave  officially  designated  as  Chinatown  is  another  haven  of  solitude  known  as  the  Lon  Wa  Buddhist  Temple.  An  aura  of  true  tranquillity  surrounds  the  largest  Buddhist  temple  in  Mindanao.Ironically,  many  visitors  find  the  attractions  sited  at  the  doorstep  of  Davao  to  be  more  engaging  than  those  within  the  1.2  million  strong  city.  Two  excursions  I  undertook  are  highly  recommended.  One  was  to  see  a  magnificent  creature  that  flies;  the  other  was  to  gaze  on  beautiful  creations  that  bloom.  The  Philippine  Eagle  is  on  the  verge  of  extinction  with  an  estimated  500  pairs  still  surviving  in  the  wild.  Some  20  years  ago  the  Philippine  Eagle  Foundation  was  established  to  save  the  white  crested  raptor  with  its  two  metre  wingspan  as  well  as  its  rainforest  habitat.  Visitors  to  the  tree-studded  centre,  an  hour's  drive  into  the  cool  highlands  beyond  Davao,  learn  of  conservation  efforts  and  see  protected  eagles  including  Pagasa.  The  aptly  named  ""Hope""  was  the  first  Philippine  Eagle  to  be  born  as  a  result  of  the  centre's  ongoing  artificial  breeding  programme.   Less  than  one  km  away  at  the  Malagos  Garden  Resort,  an  accredited  and  awarded  wildlife  farm,  incredible  flowers  not  awesome  eagles  attract  attention.  The  12  ha.  farm  houses  more  than  200  species  of  orchids  including  a  lovely  forest  of  waling-waling,  a  rare  variegated  beauty  that  thrives  with  tender  care.  Additional  activities  include  a  cultural  presentation  made  by  local  tribal  groups  and  the  opportunity  to  stroll  through  the  landscaped  grounds  of  this  jewel  in  the  jungle.  More  adventurous  travellers  will  want  to  participate  in  a  four  day  trek  to  the  summit  of  Mt  Apo.  The  3144  m  high  dormant  volcano  -  the  last  eruption  was  in  1640  -  and  the  highest  peak  in  the  country  is  the  natural  habitat  of  the  Philippine  Eagle.  During  a  memorable  jaunt  -  best  undertaken  in  an  organised  group  -  an  eagle  or  two  may  be  seen  circling  above  cascading  waterfalls  or  spectacular  geysers.

"  NO  SECULAR,  JUST  JEWISH   IAN  Bersten  {AJN  8/9)  correctly  sus  pects  that  I  do  not  recognise  as  a  legit  imate  group  of  the  community  one  that  does  not  recognise  the  authority  of  the  Sydney  Beth  Din.   Authentic  Judaism  makes  no  dis  tinction  between  religious  and  secular.  We  are  taught  that  the  first  question  to  be  asked  of  a  Jew  when  he  leaves  this  world  is:  “how  did  you  conduct  your  business;  were  you  strictly  honest?”   Governments  can  only  properly  recognise  minorities  in  terms  of  their  religion,  ethnicity  or  culture.   Religion  seems  self  evident,  but  is   far  from  it  when  we  look  at  Scientol   ogy  and  suchlike.  Ethnicity  is  incon  gruous  as  applied  to  Jews:  “ethnic”  was  coined  to  apply  to  non-Christian  and  non-Jewish  heathens  and  pagans.   “Culture”  is  etymologically  rooted  in  the  Latin;  “cultus”  which  means  worship;  hence  a  “cult”  is  the  worship  of  a  person  or  thing.  Jews  never  had  a  “culture”  that  was  not  strictly  rooted  in  Torah.  Much  that  passes  as  “Jewish”  today  is  borrowed  from  a  variety  of  Diaspora  communities.  How  can  you  recognise  as  “Jewish”  a  third-genera  tion  Australian  secularist  with  a  Jewish  father?   There  are  over  a  million  Israeli  Arabs;  some  are  secularists,  Hebrew  speaking,  culturally  Israeli;  are  they  better  “Jews”  than  Australian  secular  ists  bom  of  Jewish  mothers?

"  DUBBED  by  the  tabloids  as  “Brangelina""  before  her  birth,  the  baby  girl  born  this  week  in   Namibia  to  the  world's  “most  beauti  ful  family”   Hollywood  megastars  Angelina  Jolie  (far  right)  and  Brad  Pitt  -  was  ultimately  named  Shiloh  Nouvel  Jolie-Pitt,   sparking  a  flurry  of  speculation  about  the  origin  of  the  newborn's  name.  French  purists  objected  to  the  mascu  line  “nouvel”,  rather  than  the  feminine  “nouvelle”,  while  Hebrew  linguists  debated  whether  the  couple  meant  their  daughter  to  be  ""peaceful  one”  “gift”,  or  -  according  to  Christian  the  ology  -  the  messiah.   We  prefer  the  version  that  has  the  world’s  most  famous  baby  named  after  the  1200-strong  West  Bank  Jewish  settlement  of  Shiloh,  which  was  also  the  one-time  resting  place  of  the  Ark  of  the  Covenant  and  the  place  where  the  prophet  Samuel   was  raised.

"  FUZZY  CENSUS   I  WAS  dismayed  by  the  framing  of  key  census  questions  in  relation  to  religion  and  ancestry.  Question  19  -   “What  is  a  person’s  religion?”  -  lists  nine  options  plus  “other  -  please  specify”.   The  options  included  seven  Chris  tian  denominations,  ranging  from  Catholic  to  Lutheran,  as  well  as  Bud  dhism  and  Islam  -  while  Judaism  did   not  rate  a  mention.   Many  Jews  who  are  very  confident  in  their  Jewish  identity,  and  who  sub  scribe  to  a  shul,  are  not  actually  believers.  Their  Judaism,  including  shul  attendance,  is  primarily  a  cultur  al  and  ethnic  affiliation.  If  there  is  no  box  to  tick,  they  might  feel  even  less  motivated  to  nominate  Judaism  sim  ply  as  their  “religion”.   Similarly  question  18  asks,  “What  is  a  person’s  ancestry?”,  giving  exam  ples  such  as  English,  Irish,  Scottish,   German  and  Chinese.  It  is  not  clear  if   ancestry  is  meant  to  be  nationality  or  ethnicity,  or  a  kind  of  hybrid.   Based  on  these  examples,  many  Jews  would  write  down  the  country  of  their  parent’s  origin,  such  as  Aus  tralian,  Polish,  Lithuanian,  South  African,  ie,  whatever  was  on  their  par  ents’  passport.  My  own  preference  was  Jewish  (Ashkenazi/Eastem  Euro  pean),  which  would  accurately  describe  most  of  our  community.   If  Jews  do  not  go  out  of  their  way  to  identify  their  affiliation  in  answer  to  rather  poorly-framed  questions,  there  is  a  risk  of  poor  outcomes,  such   as  the  underestimation  of  the  number  of  Jews,  with  adverse  effects  for  fund  ing  of  services  to  our  community.

"  Archbishop  ‘apologises’  for  divestment   LONDON  -  Archbishop  of  Canter  bury  Rowan  Williams  has  written  to  British  Chief  Rabbi  Jonathan  Sacks  to  apologise  for  the  Church  of  England’s  vote  last  week  to  divest  from  compa  nies  whose  products  are  used  by  the  Israeli  Government  in  the  territories.   This  despite  the  fact  that  Williams   himself  backed  the  anti-Israel  vote.   The  vote  last  week  by  the  General  Synod,  the  church’s  parliament,  to  “disinvest  from  companies  profiting  from  the  illegal  occupation”,  prompted  widespread  opprobrium  and  severely   For  or  against?

But  in  a  letter  to  Sacks,  Williams  has  expressed  his  “deep  regret”  for  the  “deep  distress”  caused  by  the  vote,  and   said  the  church  has  been  misunder  stood  and  had  “not  resolved  to  disin   vest”.  Sacks,  evidently  prepared  to  try  and  downplay  the  dispute,  welcomed   the  Williams  clarification.   Williams  wrote  that  the  church  was   seeking  to  register  its  “concern”  over   the  “demolition  of  Palestinian  homes”   by  the  Israeli  Government  and  to   “review  whether  we  should  or  could   continue  with  an  investment  policy  which  appeared  to  accept  something  with  which  we  were  deeply  uneasy”.   Williams  acknowledged  that  the  timing  of  the  synod  vote  was  “unfortu  nate”,  following  closely  upon  the  Hamas  electoral  victory,  but  stated  that  the  church  had  “emphatically  not”  rec  ommended  a  boycott  or  compromised  its  “commitment  to  oppose  any  form   of  antisemitism  at  home  or  abroad”.

"  CHRISTIAN  CLAIMS   ARI  Morris  (AJN  1/6)  walks  around  the  streets  of  Jerusalem  with  very  dark  glasses  on.  He  claims,  “The  Arabs  possess  no  legitimate  claim,  whether  historical,  moral  or  religious,  to  Jerusalem.”   First,  one  only  needs  to  walk  around  to  see  nearly  1400  years  of   continuous  Arab  settlement  to  see   that  his  claim  is  patently  false.   Second,  his  religious  bias  blinds  him  to  the  fact  that  not  all  Arabs  are  Muslims.  Thus,  appalling  ignorance  of  Palestinian  diversity  blinds  him  to  the  fact  that  many  Arabs  are  in  fact  Christian  -  and  Christians,  I  hope  he  is  prepared  to  admit,  have  had  a  pretty  strong  spiritual  claim  on  Jerusalem  and  its  surrounds,  since  at  least  the  time  of  Jesus,  and  most  cer  tainly  since  Emperor  Constantine’s  mother  built  the  first  Church  of  the  Holy  Sepulchre  in  326  CE.

"  Red  Cross  and  Christian  leaders   slam  Israel’s  defence  policies   SHARON  BERGER  AND  PETER  KOHN   A  REPORT  critical  of  the  Palestinian   situation  released  by  the  International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  (ICRC)  has  been  vigorously  challenged  by  local  Jewish  groups.   The  Israeli  Embassy,  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  (NSWJBD)  and  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  (AIJAC)  have  criti  cised  the  supposedly  non-partisan  organisation  for  ignoring  the  full  facts   about  the  situation  in  the  Palestinian   territories  and  for  politicising  its  role.   The  Israeli  Embassy  said  the  report  failed  to  understand  the  polit   ical  situation  in  the  Palestinian  terri  tories.   “The  restrictions  on  Gaza  are  a   consequence  of  the  dire  security  situ  ation.  The  Israel  Defence  Forces,  in   implementing  these  restrictions,  has  sought  to  balance  the  security  issues  against  the  humanitarian  issues,”  said  embassy  spokesperson  Dor  Shapira.   He  noted  that  the  daily  launch  of  Kassam  rockets  on  the  southern  Israeli  town  of  Sderot  was  only  briefly   mentioned  in  the  report,  despite  the  rockets  destroying  a  family  home  and  injuring  a  toddler  in  the  last  few  days.   AIJAC  international  and  commu  nity  affairs  director  Jeremy  Jones  crit  icised  the  report’s  claim  that  1.4  million  Palestinians  were  trapped  in  the  overcrowded  Gaza  Strip  and  were  largely  unable  to  leave  Gaza,  which  it  said  had  become  progressively   smaller  as  Israel  has  extended  its  buffer  zone.   “If  people  are  not  willing  to  look  at  the  entire  picture  of  what  Hamas  promises  and  what  it  is  delivering,  and  Israel’s  many  attempts  to  bring  about  a  fair  and  just  settlement”,  Jones  said,  “then  it  can  be  very  easy  to  draw  false  conclusions,  to  misdirect  attempts  to  rectify  the  human  tragedy.”  He  added  that  the  people  of  Gaza  were  not  innocent  bystanders,  because  they  had  voted  for  Hamas.   Jones  said  the  charter  of  Hamas  called  for  the  “violent  destruction  of  Israel”  and  that  “the  ethnic  cleansing  of  the  Jewish  majority  from  the  entire  Holy  Land  was  a  program  for  genocide.”   Since  the  security  fence  was  erected,  Palestinian  terrorist  groups  have  been   unsuccessful  in  causing  large-scale  attacks,  such  as  this  bus  bombing  in  Jerusalem  in  February  2004  that  killed  eight.  Critics,  such  as  the  Red  Cross,  claim  this  has   been  at  the  expense  of  Palestinian  dignity.  Photo:  JTA   NSWJBD  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  responded  to  the  ICRC  report  by  saying,  “The  fundamental  issue  is  that   Israel’s  activities  in  Gaza  and  the  West   Bank  are  predicated  on  one  impera  tive  -  to  stop  its  citizens  being  killed  by  terrorists.”   This  week,  nine  Australian  Chris   tian  church  leaders,  including  Anglican  primate  Archbishop  Philip  Aspinall,  returned  from  Israel  and  the  Palestinian  territories  and  also  issued  a  statement  criticising  Israel’s  defence  strategies.  Executive  Council  of  Aus  tralian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  president  Robert  Goot  said  the  group  had   “overlooked  fundamental  aspects  of  the  conflict  between  Israel  and  the  Palestinians  and  notably  failed  to  mention  Hamas,  let  alone  its  refusal  to  disavow  murderous  attacks  aimed  at  Israeli  civilians”.   Goot  said  the  church  leaders’  criti  cism  in  regard  to  Israel’s  right  to  defend  its  citizens  was  “one-sided  and  unfair”.  The  Christian  church  group  implied  that  Israel  had  other  defence  options  available,  but  did  not  specify  what  it  thought  these  might  be,  he   said.   The  group  also  criticised  the   restriction  on  Palestinian  move  ments,  but  Goot  said  the  church  leaders  did  not  appear  to  recognise  the  restrictions  had  greatly  reduced  “terrorist  bombings  that  have  killed   and  maimed  thousands  of  Israeli  civilians”.   Shapira  said  in  response  to  the  ICRC  report’s  criticism  of  the  security   fence  that  it  had  reduced  the  number  of  Israeli  deaths  from  the  hundreds  annually  to  single  digits  since  its  con   struction  in  2004.

"  Time  to  rethink  religious  education   BEYOND   CHUTZPAH   MICHAEL  VISONTAV   Token  Christmas  services   at  state  schools  place  non  Christian  students  and  their  parents  in  an  uncomfortable  and   undeserved  predicament.   I  This  default  to   Christianity  is  at  best  outmoded  and  at   I  worst  inconsiderate.  |  There  is  no  good  I  reason  for  public   I  schools  to  hold   1  Christian  services.   THE  main  festive  season   (Chanukah)  has  now  passed   and  another  smaller  one  is   approaching.  Just  when   youve  dealt  with  the  presents,  you  have  to  confront  another  perennial:  religion  in  state  schools.   Both  my  children  attend  state  schools  and  the  end  of  year  is  synony  mous  with  notes  announcing  there  will  be  church  services  for  the  Chris  tian  holiday  known  as  Christmas.  More  significantly,  parents  have  to  sign  a  form  if  they  don’t  want  their   children  to  attend  such  services.   This  was  not  a  feature  of  my  own  education,  also  at  a  state  school.  But  then,  the  separation  between  church  and  state  was  a  lot  stronger  than  it  is  today.  The  western  world  was  more  concerned  with  civil  rights  -  blacks,  gays,  women’s  liberation,  anti-war  -  than  with  religion.  It  was  about  rela  tionships  between  people,  not  between  people  and  a  god.  Atheism  was  big,  religion  was  small.   Those  parents  who  choose  to  send  their  children  to  state  schools  do  so   largely  because  they  want  a  broad  and   non-denominational  educational  environment,  exposing  them  to  a  wide  range  of  ethnic,  cultural  and   social  values  to  take  into  adulthood.   The  token  provision  of  scripture  classes  is  a  relic  from  a  time  when  reli   gion  was  tangled  up  with  the  state,  and  acts  as  a  sop  to  the  larger  Chris  tian  religions,  who  have  the  resources   to  do  this  outreach  work.   For  those  who  attend,  it  provides  a  once-over  lightly  of  already-known  stories  and  morality.  It’s  of  limited  and  diminishing  value  in  a  world  where  children  are  taught  to  question  everything.   Then  there  is  the  assumption  that  school  church  services,  at  Easter  and  Christmas,  are  for  everyone.  This  places  an  unpleasant  burden  on  the  child,  making  them  feel  an  outsider.  This  default  to  Christianity  is  at  best   outmoded  and  at  worst  inconsiderate.   For  non-Christians,  there  is  the  actual  experience  of  sitting  in  some  room,  doing  nothing,  while  the  service  is  held,  followed  by  the  awk  ward  questions  from  other  children.  In  addition,  they’re  not  given  any  alternative  learning  or  religious  experience.   In  my  son’s  high  school,  these  problems  have  been  informally  com  pounded  by  teacher  bias.  His  English  teacher,  who  wears  her  Christianity  on  her  sleeve,  gave  the  class  Christian  poetry  to  analyse.  Not  only  did  this  place  children  of  that  faith  at  an  advantage  through  their  existing  knowledge  of  references  and  metaphors,  but  it  puts  other  children  under  not-so-subtle  scrutiny  if  they  challenge  the  texts.   In  this  post-September  11  era,  reli  gion  and  faith  have  become  the  focal  points  of  personal  and  international  life,  rivalling  economics  for  their  impact  on  our  day-to-day  existence.   It’s  time  for  governments  to  stop  weekly  scripture  classes  and  replace  them  with  a  genuine  program  of  comparative  religion.  Make  it  a  sub  ject,  even  in  primary  school  -  no,  especially  in  primary  school,  when   their  minds  are  most  open.   Take  the  Christianity  out  of  state  schools  and  replace  scripture  classes  with  regular  lessons  by  a  qualified,  independent  teacher  who  will  expose  them  to  all  the  major  and  minor  reli  gions  in  an  unbiased  way.  Children  need  to  be  taught  about  the  stories,   events  and  values  that  these  faiths   share,  what  they  have  in  common,  and  how  they  differ.   If  there  is  one  lesson  of  the  past  six  years,  it  is  that  religion  matters  as  much  as  it  ever  did,  perhaps  more,  in  an  increasingly  polarised  world.   The  benefits  would  be  enormous:   for  Jews  and  other  minority  religions,   who  live  in  a  world  that  revolves  around  the  Jesus  narrative,  it  would  remove  the  stigma  of  being  non  Christian.  For  Christians,  it  would  provide  exposure  to  other  ways  of  life.   Comparative  religion  classes  wouldn’t  mean  any  children  stop  learning  about  their  own  faith.  That  is  a  question  of  parental  responsibility.  But  they  could  see  their  own  religion   in  the  context  of  others  and  other   people  who  believe  in  them.  It  would  take  the  unknown  out  of  religion,  which  breeds  fear  and  hatred,  and  replace  it  with  contact,  questions  and  understanding.   How  to  make  it  happen?  Religious  and  community  leaders  have  regular  contact  with  state  governments  and  education  departments.  It’s  a  ques   tion  of  will  and  commitment.  Trial  it  in  a  few  schools  to  see  how  it  works.   Then,  with  a  bit  of  luck,  all  chil  dren  might  have  a  happy  Chanukah,   as  well  as  Christmas.

"  HOLIDAY  RITUAL:  BLAMING  THE  JEWS  FOR  CHRISTIAN  SUFFERING     Some  Australian  media   outlets  have  made  a  habit  of  blaming  Israel  for  the  plight  of  Christians  in  Bethlehem  and  other   Palestinian  areas.  They  should  look  elsewhere.    MEDIA  MATTERS  -------------------------------------------   TZVI  FLEISCHER   CHRISTMAS  is  a  time  of  ritu-   als,  and  one  ritual  the  media  has  every  December  is  pub-  lishing  stories  bemoaning  the     As  one  Bethlehem  Christian  told  a   reporter:  “All  this  talk  about  Israel  driving  Christians  out  and  causing  pain  is   nonsense.”   rate  of  Bethlehem’s  Christian  Palestini-  ans.  The  plight  of  the  Christians  of  Bethlehem  does  deserve  scrutiny,  but  unfortunately,  these  stories  almost  always  incorrectly  blame  Israel  for  the   situation.   Sometimes  Bethlehem  Christmas   stories  have  an  especially  ugly  angle  -  the  implication  that  Palestinians  are  suffering  the  same  fate  at  the  hands  of  the  Israelis  as  Jesus  (or  his  family)  did  at  the  hands  of  his  persecutors.   New  Media  Watch  compere  Tim  Palmer,  then  the  ABC’s  Middle  East  correspondent,  provided  a  classic  example  in  2000.  Reporting  on  the  sit-  uation  in  Bethlehem,  he  emphasised  that  “biblical  parallels  abound”.  Examples  he  gave  included  a  carpen-  ter  named  Joseph  who  had  to  leave  his  home  because  of  the  fighting,  and  shell  damage  to  a  hotel  so  it  would  therefore  have  to  turn  travellers  away.   SBS  World  News  this  year  (26/12)  had  a  story  with  similar  implications,  tracing  the  “biblical  journey  under  taken  by  Joseph  and  Mary  from  Nazareth  to  Bethlehem”.  The  report  said  that  the  journey  was  “difficult”  but  the  route  today  is  “more  challeng-  ing”  still,  because  of  Israeli  check-  points  and  the  security  fence.  A  biblical  scholar  interviewed,  Stephan  Pfann,  insisted  that  there  is  “an  inter-  esting  parallel  that  can  be  drawn”   between  “border  crossings”  and  “sol-  diers  on  the  border”  at  present,  and  “taxation  and  other  types  of  things”  from  the  biblical  story.   The  Age  (23/12)  had  its  own  story  re-tracing  Joseph  and  Mary’s  journey,  sourced  from  Rory  McCarthy  of  Britain’s  relentlessly  anti-Israel  Guardian.  The  piece  avoided  making  direct  biblical  parallels,  but  was  nonetheless  primarily  an  excuse  to  attack  Israeli  checkpoints  and  the  security  barrier  encountered  along  the  way.  Bethlehem’s  mayor  com-  plained  his  city  is  a  “big  prison”  because  of  what  McCarthy  falsely  describes  as  “10-metre-high  Israeli  security  wall  built  around  Bethlehem”.  (The  barrier  isn’t  all  around,  only  on  the  Israeli  side  of  the  town,  countering  suicide  bombing  and  sniping  at  Jerusalem  neighbourhoods  which  have  emanated  from  Bethlehem.  And  it  mostly  isn’t  a  wall.)   McCarthy  goes  on  to  characterise  what  every  Christian  in  the  town  supposedly  thinks,  without  quoting  any  sources,  saying  they  are  a  “com-  munity  that  blames  the  wall  for  turn-  ing  their  home  into  a  ghetto”.   Interestingly,  SBS  told  viewers  that  Joseph  and  Mary  must  have  come  down  the  Jordan  Valley  through  Jeri-   cho,  while  the  Age/Guardian  story  describes  their  trip  along  the  moun-  tain  ridge  route  via  Jenin,  Nablus  and  Jerusalem.  The  gospels  are  actually  silent  on  this  point,  but  that  does  not  stand  in  the  way  of  the  political  point  scoring.   Finally,  on  December  26,  the  Age  published  an  opinion  piece  by  Pales-  tinian  Christian  expatriate  Abe  Ata,  whose  “facts”  were  patently  non-fac-  tual.  The  piece  claimed  that  in  1948,  there  were  400,000  Palestinian  Chris-  tians,  and  there  are  now  60,000.  In  fact,  census  data  shows  that  there  were  140,000  Christians  in  all  of  mandatory  Palestine  in  1945  and  today  Israel  is  home  to  120,000  Arab  Christians,  up  from  34,000  in  1949.   Close  to  40,000  more  now  live  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza,  and  it  is  this  number  that  is  dwindling.  Both  McCarthy  and  Ata  mentioned  the  dwindling  Christian  population  of  Bethlehem,  which  is  quite  real,  but  both  blamed  the  wrong  sources.  Ata  asserted  hyperbolically  that  the  Israeli  right  and  American  fundamentalist  Christians  are  jointly  trying  to  ethni-  cally  cleanse  the  West  Bank  of  all  Pales-  tinians,  including  Christians.  McCarthy  blamed  the  security  barrier.   The  Christian  percentage  of  the  Bethlehem  population  has  been  declining  since  1948,  when  it  was  85  per  cent,  to  around  20  per  cent  now.  And  while  the  current  violence  and  lack  of  pilgrims  doubtless  accelerate  emigration,  the  latter  was   high  well  before  both.   There  is  evidence  that  Palestinian  Authority  (PA)  rule  saw  a  deliberate  policy  to  Islamise  the  town,  incorpo-  rating  neighbouring  Muslim  refugee  camps  in  the  city  boundaries,  and  replacing  the  Christian  town  leader  ship  with  Muslims.  There  has  also  been  an  explosion  of  harassment  of  West  Bank  Christians  in  recent  years,  with  the  PA  legal  system  failing  to  protect  Christians  from  both  Muslim  thugs  and  efforts  to  steal  their  land.  As  one  Bethlehem  Christian  told  a  reporter  in  2005,  “All  this  talk  about  Israel  driving  Christians  out  and  causing  pain  is  nonsense.  You  want  to  know  what  is  at  play  here,  just  come  throughout  the  year  and  see  the  intimidation  from  the  Muslims.  They  have  burned  down  our  stores,  built  mosques  in  front  of  our  churches,  stole  our  real  estate  and  took  away  our  rights.”   In  fact,  a  growingly  assertive  Islamist  identity  has  seen  Christian  populations  decline  in  virtually  every  country  across  the  Middle  East  (except  Israel),  as  Christian  Arabs  emigrate  away  from  an  increasingly   insecure  situation.   If  Australian  media  really  want  to  tell  the  story  of  the  Christians  of  Jesus’  birthplace,  then  this  is  the  trend  they  should  be  reporting  on.  -----------------------------------------------------------   Tzvi  Fleischer  is  editor  of  AIR,  the  monthly  magazine  of  the  Australia/Israel   &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council.

"  Rubenstein  warns   outspoken  pastor   NAOMI  LEVIN   AUSTRALIA/ISRAEL  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  executive  director  Colin  Rubenstein,  has  spoken  out  against  a  Christian  pastor  who  gave  a  speech  at  a  2005  meeting  of  the  anti-Jewish,  Holocaust-denying,  extreme-right  group  League  of  Rights.   Pastor  Danny  Nalliah  from  Catch  the  Fire  ministry  -  an  evan  gelical  organisation  that  has  made  personal  representations  to  both  John  Howard  and  Peter  Costello  -  told  The  Age  he  spoke  to  League  of  Rights  representatives  because  he  hoped  to  “change  some  of  their  thinking”.   Rubenstein  declined  to  com  ment  on  Howard  and  Costello’s   relationship  with  Catch  the  Fire,  an  organisation  that  has  previously  been  critical  of  other  faiths,  but  said  that  meeting  with  League  of  Rights  members  only  gives  oxygen  to  the  organisation.   “The  real  message  from  our  community  and  from  me  is  that  we’re  quite  strong  on  the  view  that   Dr  Colin  Rubensteln...  “No-one  should  be  giving  any  sort  of  credibility  or   respectability  to  the  League  of  Rights.”   no-one  should  be  giving  any  sort  of  credibility  or  respectability  to  the  League  of  Rights,”  he  said.   The  AJN  understands  that  widely-known  Holocaust-denier  and  revisionist  Dr  Frederick  Toben   posed  a  question  about  the  Holo  caust  to  Nalliah  after  his  speech.   While  Nalliah  told  The  Age  that  he  responded:  “To  deny  the  Holo  caust  would  be  like  saying  there  will  be  no  daybreak  tomorrow  morn  ing”,  Dr  Toben’s  website  records  that  Nalliah  “said  something  about  not  knowing  anything  about  the  topic”.

"  Brigitte  Gabriel   Lebanese-born  Christian  broadcaster  and  commentator   Growing  up  as  a  member  of  a  Christian  family  in  southern  Lebanon  in  the  1970s  and  ’80s,  how  was  Israel  portrayed  to  you?   By  the  1970s,  Muslims  had  become  the  majority  and  the  media  was  government  controlled,  so  all  we  heard  on  TV  was  that  Israel  was  bar  baric  ...  evil,  and  the  only  time  that  we  would  have  peace  in  the  Middle  East  was  when  all  the  Jews  were  killed  and  thrown  into  the  sea.  At  home,  I  wasn’t  taught  to  hate  because  Christians  don’t  preach  hatred.  How  did  you  come  to  a  different  perspective  off  Israel?   When  I  was  10  years  old,  when  the  Palestinians  and  [Lebanese]  Muslims  surrounded  us,  we  were  either  going  to  be  slaughtered  or  go  to  Israel  and  beg  for  help.  Our  backs  were  to  Israel  because  we  lived  near  the  border.  Of  our  two  enemies,  we  knew  the  Jews  were  not  going  to  slaughter  us  because  we  had  more  shared  values  with  them  than  with  the  Muslims.  When  I  was  11,  Israel  began  helping  the  Christians,  coming  in  the  middle  of  the  night,  providing  ammunition  for  the  Christian  [Phalangist]  military,  bringing  baby  food...  providing  bomb  shelters.  We  knew  we  were  alive  because  of  Israel.   What  role  did  the  1982  Lebanon  War  play  in  changing  your  outlook?  In  1982,  my  mother  became  wounded  when  a  bomb  exploded  in  front  of  our  shelter  as  the  Muslims  were  bombing  us  when  Israel  invaded  Lebanon.  That’s  when  we  had  to  go  to  Israel  for  treatment.  For  my  mother,  it  was  a  life-saving  experience,  for  me  it  was  a  life-changing  expe  rience.  That’s  when  I  came  in  contact  with  Israeli  civilians.  At  their  most  trying  moments,  in  the  middle  of  the  war,  I  was  able  to  see  such  com  passion.  We  spent  22  days  in  a  hospital.  I  wanted  to  adopt  the  values  of  that  hospital,  where  they  treated  everyone  according  to  their  injury,  as  human  beings.  They  were  even  treating  terrorists.  I  could  understand  why  they  were  helping  me,  I  was  their  ally,  but  why  were  they  helping  Palestinians?  But  little  did  I  know  about  the  values  and  culture  of  Israelis.  After  those  22  days,  I  felt  I  was  really  more  at  home  in  Israel  and  I  decided  to  move  there.  I  was  able  to  do  that  three  years  later  [as  a  journalist].   You  compare  the  society  in  Lebanon,  when  it  was  a  majority  Christian  state,  with  file  Palestinian  territories.  What  are  the  differences?   We  [the  former  majority  of  Christians  in  Lebanon]  had  Judeo-Christian  values.  But  the  Arab  countries  with  Muslim  majorities  were  all  equally  vengeful  towards  Israel.  However,  today  the  venom  being  espoused  in  the  Palestinian  territories  -  the  glorification  of  death  and  destruction  and  martyrdom  -  has  reached  such  levels  that  people  have  lost  their  consciences  and  every  thread  of  humanity.   Do  you  think  education  is  the  key  and  how  can  this  be  changed?   [The  West]  needs  to  put  diplomatic  pressure  on  Arab  countries  to  stop  their  hate  education.  And  we  need  to  empower  moderate  Muslims  who  seek  to  reform  Islam,  to  bring  it  up  to  the  21st  century.  An  Israeli  academic,  Professor  Raphael  Israeli,  caused  a  storm  when  he  visited  Australia  recently  and  said  western  countries,  including  Australia,  should  limit  their  intake  of  Muslim  immigrants.  What’s  your  view?   You  can’t  paint  the  wide  brush  and  say  all  Muslims  are  terrorists.  I  know  many  wonderful  Muslim  moderates  who  are  trying  to  reform  Islam.  Those  are  the  voices  speaking  up,  such  as  [authors]  Salman  Rushdie,  Irshad  Manji,  [Syrian  psychiatrist]  Wafa  Sultan,  [anti-terror  advocate]  Noni  Darwish  -  those  are  the  ones  we  should  welcome  into  the  West.   Jgfamo-fascism  is  a  greater  threat  even  than  ftazism.  A  nuclear  bomb  can  do  in  seconds’""5  Imat  it  took  Hitler  years  to  accomplish.  J?   What  should  be  done  about  extremist  Islamic  leaders  in  western  communities?   We  have  to  be  wise  to  the  warning  signs.  When  we  see  people  preach  ing  hatred,  supporting  terrorist  organisations  ...  they  should  be  expelled  or  placed  in  isolation  so  they  can’t  infect  others  with  their  hate.  I’m  sure  most  Australians,  most  Americans  and  British,  will  do  whatever  they  can  to  stop  the  poisoning  of  young,  impressionable   minds.   What  is  the  aim  of  your  organisation,  the  American  Congress  for   Truth?   It  was  founded  in  2002.  After  September  11  [2001],  I  realised  people  in  America  and  the  rest  of  the  world  needed  to  be  educated  about  the  threat  of  radical  Islam  to  world  peace  and  the  security  of  the  US.  We  send  out  regular  emails  where  we  inform  the  public  about  how  they  can  become  a  voice  in  their  community.  We  have  thousands  of  mem  bers  in  the  US  and  in  20  other  countries.  We  have  members  in  Melbourne  and  Sydney.   Tell  me  about  your  book,  Because  They  Hate.   It  was  published  in  September  and  has  become  a  New  York  Times  national  bestseller.  I’ve  been  fortunate  to  have  my  writing  resonate  with  so  many  westerners.  My  book  was  written  as  a  warning  to  the  West,  specifically  to  America.  As  a  survivor  of  war  in  Lebanon,  I  know  the  price  of  war.   You’ve  had  some  very  personally  threatening  reactions  to  your  lec  tures  in  the  US,  such  as  at  the  University  of  Memphis,  where  there  was  security  on  the  stage  with  you.  How  do  you  feel  personally  about  taking  your  message  to  the  public?   I’m  very  passionate  about  my  message.  We  lost  our  democracy  [in  Lebanon].  I  had  my  country  pulled  out  like  a  rug  from  under  my  feet.  Islamo-fascism  is  a  greater  threat  even  than  Nazism.  A  nuclear  bomb  can  do  in  seconds  what  it  took  Hitler  years  to  accomplish.  We,  as  civilised  individuals,  can  no  longer  sit  on  the  sidelines  and  hear  peo  ple  like  [Iranian  President  Mahmoud]  Ahmadinejad  speak  of  wiping  Israel  off  the  map,  six  million  people  with  one  bomb.  I’m  willing  to  risk  my  life  to  save  the  lives  of  others.  If  enough  people  had  spo  ken  up  before  World  War  II,  maybe  we  could  have  saved  millions  of  people  around  the  world  from  dying.

"  How  to  Disprove  Christianity  -------------------------------------   As  many  Christian  believers  will  attest,  the  frustration  of  reading  Richard  Dawkins'  God  Delusion  is  at  times  difficult  to  bear.  For  the  most  part  it  is  an  entertaining  read  —  lots  of  interesting  anecdotes  —  but  it  is  frustrating  because  it  does  not  go  very  far  at  all  in  confronting  the  core  claims  of  Christianity.  Like  a  med  revue  that  manages  to  approach  all  sorts  of  topics  from  every  angle  but  the  funny  one,  Dawkins  only  ever  comes  at  Christianity  obliquely.  Yes,  Dawkins  gets  plenty  right.  But  where  he  is  right,  it  does  nothing  to  disprove  the  existence  of  the  God  of  the  Bible.  It's  true  we  need  to  stop  labelling  children  according  to  the  religion  their  parents  only  nominally  adhere  to,  and  that  religion  has  been  used  throughout  history  as  a  tool  for  oppression  and  a  justification  for  unjust  wars.   None  of  these  actually  go,  however,  to  disproving  the  Christian  God.  It  would  be  like  calling  for  the  system  of  common  law  to  be  abolished  based  on  my  fumbled  attempts  at  first-year  law  essays.  The  fact  is,  if  anyone  were  serious  about  disproving  Christianity,  they  would  have  to  attack  its  historicity.  At  the  core  of  all  Christian  belief  is  a  set  of  events  that  Christians  claim  actually  happened.  The  human  Jesus  of  Nazareth,  who  lived  in  first  century  Palestine,  was  God,  died  on  a  Roman  cross,  and  resurrected  three  days  later.  All  of  Jesus'  and  the  apostles'  claims  about  who  Jesus  was  hang  on  these  events.  The  Christian  dependence  on  historical  events  is  one  of  the  crucial  differences  between  how  God  is  revealed  in  Christianity,  and  how  God  is  revealed  in  Islam.  In  Islam,  God  reveals  himself  by  speaking  through  prophets  -  primarily  Mohammad  in  the  Quran.  Christianity,  conversely,  has  always  affirmed  that  while  God  spoke  through  prophets,  this  was  only  ever  a  shadow  -  a  foretaste   of  his  ultimate  disclosure  of  himself  as  Jesus  of  Nazareth.  Jesus  was  God  in  human  flesh.  If  the  Christian  claim  about  the  truth  of  the  events  through  which  Jesus  accomplished  his  earthly  mission  is  proven  to  be  baseless,  then  very  quickly  you  have  no  revelation  of  God,  and  therefore  no  Christian  God  at  all.  To  be  fair,  however,  it  is  actually  not  surprising  that  Dawkins  doesn't  really  tackle  Christianity  from  this  angle.  Of  course  he  wouldn't  -  he's  a  scientist.  But  he  should  have  known  better  than  to  dismiss  the  historical  arguments  in  six  half-baked  pages  (pp92-97).  On  his  way  to  reaching  his  clanger  of  a  conclusion  that  ""reputable  biblical  scholars  do  not  in  general  regard  the  New  Testament  as  a  reliable  record  of  what  actually  happened  in  history""  (p97),  the  reader  is  told  that  the  four  gospels  were  chosen  ""arbitrarily,""  and  that  the  gospel  writers  ""almost  certainly  never  met  Jesus  personally"".  At  this  point,  Dawkins  is  simply  wrong.  It  is  clear  from  endnotes  and  text  notes  that  Dawkins  relies  on  the  work  of  Bart  Ehrman,  AN  Wilson,  Robin  Lane  Fox  and  Jacques  Berlinerblau,  each  of  whom  are  in  regular  dialogue  with  Leigh  Teabing  and  Robert  Langdon,  and  none  of  whom  operate  within  mainstream  scholarship  on  the  question  of  Jesus.  Dawkins  would  have  been  better  off  using  his  (as  he  constantly  reminds  us)  insatiable  inquiring  mind  to  do  a  bit  of  his  own  research.  There  is  no  question  that,  by  the  mid  to  late  first  century,  Christianity  had  spread  throughout  the  Roman  empire  in  large  enough  numbers  for  the  Romans  to  pay  attention.  The  first-  (and  early  second)  century  writings  of  non-Christians  Suetonius,  Tacitus  and  Pliny  make  this  clear  enough.   From  their  writings  we  know  the  emperor  Claudius  expelled  all  Jews  from  Rome  in  AD49  because  of  disturbances  caused  by  tension  on  the  question  of  Jesus.  We  know  Christians  were  Nero's  scapegoat  after  a  fire  burned  down  three-quarters  of  Rome  in  AD64,  and  that  Christians  had  been  in  the  province  of  Bithynia  in  large  numbers  from  at  least  the  eighties.  Whether  or  not  you  take  the  gospels  as  good  history,  it  is  very  hard  to  disagree  with  the  non-Christian  sources  which  show  that  Christianity  was  a  growing  movement  in  the  Roman  empire  of  the  first  century.  This  is  significant,  because  Christianity  was,  in  essence,  the  movement  which  proclaimed  Jesus  of  Nazareth  as  Israel's  messiah.  And,  uniquely,  it  was  a  messianic  movement  with  an  executed  messiah.  In  the  hundred  years  either  side  of  Jesus,  historians  know  of  at  least  a  dozen  claimants  to  be  Israel's  king  -  God's  chosen  messiah.  Each  had  a  band  of  followers  who  were  convinced  that  this  was  the  long-awaited  person  who  was  going  to  overthrow  the  Romans  and  lead  Israel  back  to  her  rightful  place  as  the  pre-eminent  nation  in  the  world.  But  each  of  them  suffered  the  same  fate  as  Jesus  -  death  at  the  hands  of  the  Romans.  On  every  occasion  the  followers  either  gave  up  on  the  whole  messiah  thing  and  went  back  to  living  quiet  lives  in  an  attempt  to  avoid  getting  killed  themselves,  or  they  began  following  the  brother  of  the  recently-defeated  ""messiah"",  thinking  that  they  had  got  the  right  royal  lineage,  but  the  wrong  man.  They  knew  that  a  dead  messiah  was  a  failed  messiah:  how  could  a  dead  messiah  overthrow  the  Romans?  But  there  is  no  evidence  that,  once  Jesus  died,  the  early  Christians  did  either  of  those  things.  They  certainly  didn't  return  to  life  as  it  was,  and  as  for   claiming  Jesus'  brother  as  the  messiah  -  Jesus'  brother  James  was  himself  a  prominent  leader  of  the  early  church  in  Jerusalem.  Instead,  they  claimed  that  Jesus  had  been  raised  from  the  dead,  that  they  had  seen  his  physical,  resurrected,  body,  and  that  now  he  ruled  the  entire  earth,  from  heaven.  Of  all  these  messianic  movements,  only  the  Christians  claimed  that  the  messiah  had  resurrected,  and  continued  to  announce  to  the  world  that  he,  in  fact,  was  the  messiah.  And  they  did  this  despite  their  knowledge  that  it  would  inevitably  lead  to  death  at  the  hands  of  the  Romans.  A  stupid  way  to  get  killed,  were  it  not  true.  In  light  of  that  evidence,  the  best  explanation  for  the  growth  of  the  church  in  the  first  century  was  that  Jesus  resurrected  -  exactly  the  explanation  provided  in  the  New  Testament.  To  disprove  Christianity,  you  would  have  to  account  for  the  rather  odd  insistence  that  an  executed  man  was  still  the  messiah.  And  that's  even  before  dealing  with  the  books  of  the  New  Testament,  which  make  claims  that  are  consistent  with  those  of  the  non-Christian  sources,  and  apparently  does  so  from  the  perspective  of  a  group  of  eye-witnesses  of  the  resurrection.  Dawkins  does  not  address  any  of  this.  And  that's  OK  -  he's  not  a  historian.  But  surely  some  atheist  ancient  historian  of  equivalent  intellectual  standing  as  Dawkins  could  at  least  have  a  stab.  And  no  doubt  that  stab  would  land  closer  to  the  heart  of  Christianity  than  Dawkins'  scattergun  attempt.   Nick  Colyer  nick_colyer@hotmail.com ",2007-10-05

"  POSITIVE  TO  NEGATIVE   I  WAS  surprised  to  read  Johnny  Baker  (AJN  1/6)  criticise  the  JNF  for  engaging  world-renowned  Christian  Lebanese  journalist  Brigitte  Gabriel  to  address  the  Jewish  community.   Baker  was  concerned  that  Gabriel  may  have  embarrassed  the  prime  minister.  To  the  contrary:  the  PM  -  who  I  believe  was  fully  briefed  about  Gabriel  and  aware  of  what  she  was   going  to  talk  about  before  accepting  the  invitation  -  joined  the  sell-out  audience  of  1200  people  and  stood  up  to  give  her  a  standing  ovation.  Gabriel   did  not  vilify  all  Muslims,  but  rather,  as  host  Michael  Naphtali  said  in  his  introduction,  “had  the  courage  to  tell  the  truth”.  The  truth,  unfortunately,  included  Gabriel’s  personal  experi   ences  and  the  violent  treatment  of  Christians  by  her  fellow  Lebanese  Muslims  and  the  unexpected  com  passion  Israel  showed  her  family  and  other  Christians  during  their  civil   war.

"  Jewish  president  tor  inter-faith  council   TALIA  JACOBS   AFTER  two  years  in  the  hands  of  a  Christian  cleric,  the  presi  dency  of  the  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  (CCJ)  has  been  passed  to  a  member  of  the  Jewish  community.   At  the  recent  annual  gen  eral  meeting  of  the  NSW  CCJ,  William  Szekely,  an  employ  ment  lawyer  and  active  member  of  the  Jewish  com  munity,  was  elected  to  the  position,  previously  held  by  Father  Joseph  Sobb.   “I  have  been  asked  to  take   up  the  position  because  I  have  been  putting  forward  a  lot  of  ideas  about  revitalising  the  CCJ,”  said  Szekely.  “I  think  it  will  lead  to  a  greater  involve  ment  of  the  Jewish  commu  nity  in  inter-faith  activities.”   Szekely,  who  is  currently  a  board  member  of  the  Emanuel  Synagogue,  wants  to  use  his  role  to  develop  respect  between  the  faiths.   “If  both  sides  understand  how  each  other  ticks  then  that  level  of  greater  understanding  will  lead  to  greater  harmony,”   he  said.   “The  objectives  of  the  CCJ   Outgoing  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  president  Father   Joseph  Sobb  (left)  congratulates  his  successor,  William  Szekely,  at   last  week’s  AGM.   are  very  relevant  to  today  and  can  also  cater  for  dialogue  with  Muslim  communities.”   Szekely  wants  to  focus  his  efforts  as  president  of  the  council  on  greater  youth  involvement.  “Young  people  hold  the  future  and  are  the  future  itself.

HISTORY  LESSON   VIC  Alhadeff  is,  of  course,  quite  cor  rect  in  saying  that  “there  are  several  Christian  concepts  that  are  incom  patible  with  Judaism”  and  that  there   fore  so-called  “messianic  Judaism”  lies  beyond  the  pale  of  Judaism  (AJN  21/9).   However,  if  Alhadeff  is  honest  enough  to  extend  his  logical  argu  ment  further,  he  will  be  forced  to  admit  that  there  are  other  Jewish  groups  whose  ideologies  are  similarly  “incompatible”  with  what  is  properly  termed  Judaism.   Historically,  Judaism  has  always  affirmed  four  essential  beliefs:  1)  there  is  one  G-d  who  is  approach  able  without  an  intermediary;  2)  G-d  gave  the  Torah  to  the  Jewish  people;  3)  G-d  conveyed  the  essence  of  the  oral  law  to  the  Jewish  people;  4)  the  Torah  is  eternally  binding  on  the  Jewish  people.   Non-Orthodox  Jewish  groups  accept,  at  best,  only  the  first  of  these  principles,  if  that.  Secular  humanistic  “Judaism”  accepts  none  of  them.  Yet  these  groups  enjoy  respected  repre  sentation  on  the  roof  body  that  Alhadeff  represents.   It  is  unthinkable  currently  that  Jews  for  Jesus  would  ever  be  admitted  to  the  NSW  Board  of  Deputies.  How  ever,  I  recall  that  it  was  similarly  unthinkable  50  years  ago  in  my  native  UK  that  Reform  and  Liberal  commu  nities  would  have  been  permitted  ecclesiastical  representation  on  the  Board  of  Deputies  of  British  Jews.   Now  they  are  full,  equal  members  of  that  roof  body.  Maybe,  given  another  few  decades  of  clever  lobbying  and  politicking,  “messianic  Judaism”  will  likewise  be  seen  as  a  bona  fide  player  on  the  communal  scene!  Where  there  is  no  ideological  honesty  or  consis  tency,  there  are  no  guarantees.   RABBI  CHAIM  INGRAM   Sydney,  NSW ",2007-10-05
"  CONTRAST  AND  COMPARE   LEOPOLD  Amery,  a  member  of  Lloyd  George’s  cabinet  in  World  War  I,  was  a  Christian  Zionist  who  drafted  the  letter  that  became  known  as  the  Balfour  Declaration.   Amery’s  elder  son,  John,  fiercely  anti-  Communist  and  a  Fascist  sym  pathiser,  was  in  France  when  the  Third  Republic  collapsed.  He  collabo  rated  with  Vichy  and  was  recruited  by  the  Nazis,  making  broadcasts  urging  Britain  to  make  peace  with  Hitler.  He  had  support  from  many  at  the  highest  levels  of  British  society  and  parlia  ment.  He  toured  prisoner  of  war  camps  calling  on  British  POWs  to   join  his  “Legion  of  St  George”,  a  pro  posed  British  unit  to  fight  with  Nazi  Germany  against  the  Soviets.  I  heard  this  view  put  to  an  officers’  mess  one  night  in  1943;  the  speaker  was  not  contradicted;  there  was  dead  silence.   Post-war,  under  the  Attlee  Labour  Government,  John  Amery  was  tried  as  a  traitor.  He  was  hanged  at  Wandsworth  Prison  on  December  19,1945.   Compare  the  Hicks  affair.  John  Amery  did  no  more  than  talk;  his  proposed  “Legion  of  St  George”  never   materialised.  Hicks  has  had  advanced   training  from  terrorist  groups  such  as  al-Qaeda  and  Lashkar-e-Taiba,  and  has  allied  himself  as  a  fighter  with  the  Taliban,  the  enemy  against  which  our  soldiers  are  daily  risking  their  lives  in  Afghanistan.   He  is  now  preparing  to  return  to  Australia  to  spend  a  few  months  at  the  taxpayers’  expense:  three  meals  a  day  in  a  comfortable  cell  with  all  the  creature  comforts  and  the  time  and   facilities  to  negotiate  his  future,  per  haps  as  a  future  member  of  parlia  ment  following  a  ticker-tape  welcome  and  a  banquet  hosted  by  leftist  jour  nalists  and  media  personalities  who  have  built  up  his  following.   What  kind  of  message  is  being  sent  to  our  Australian  Muslims,  most  of  who  simply  want  to  be  left  in  peace  to  follow  their  frith  in  a  free  and  demo  cratic  country?

Photo:  JTA   American  Jewry  takes  a  hard  look  at  itself   NASHVILLE  -  The  home  of  country  music  and  Christian  pop  is  an  unex  pected  location  for  the  largest  annual   convention  of  the  central  American  Jewish  umbrella  organisation,  a  con  ference  focused  on  Jewish  continuity.   As  the  three-day  General  Assem  bly  (GA)  of  the  United  Jewish  Com  munities  got  underway  on  Sunday  with  3000  delegates,  the  dissonance  between  the  conference  and  its  cul  tural  backdrop  underscored  the  changing  priorities  of  American  Jewry.   This  year’s  GA  isn’t  about  Israel  or  hungry  Jews  around  the  world,  although  US  Secretary  of  State  Con  doleezza  Rice  spoke  at  the  closing  ses  sion.  Though  Nashville’s  Jewish  community  is  old  -  the  first  minyans  date  back  to  the  1840s  -  it  is  tiny,  com  prising  fewer  than  8000  souls.  And  the  entire  state  of  Tennessee  has  about  20,000  Jews.  So  it  isn’t  about  Nashville,   either.   In  coming  to  Nashville,  American  Jewry  is  making  a  dramatic  statement  that  it  must  look  inward  toward  its   own  growing  problems  and  focus  its  minds,  institutions  and  financiers  on  the  troubling  future  of  a  community  that  is  both  the  strongest  and,  in  some  ways,  the  most  endangered  on  the  planet   Flush  with  cash  and  armed  with   significant  political  and  social  influ  ence  at  all  levels  of  American  politics  and  society,  American  Jews  -  account  ing  for  almost  80  per  cent  of  the  Dias  pora  -  are  seeing  a  generational  shift  that  is  realigning  the  loyalties  and  aspi  rations  of  the  average  American  Jew.   Young  Jewish  professionals  are  increasingly  abandoning  the  commu  nity's  institutions  in  favour  of  main  stream  American  life,  and  the  Jewish  community  has  not  yet  found  a  way  to   reverse  this  trend   In  that  context,  Nashville  may  be  a  symbolic  venue.  Tennessee’s  commu  nity  is  a  telling  microcosm  of  Ameri  can  Jewry  in  general.  The  tiny  Jewish  presence  in  small-town  Tennessee  has  become  almost  extinct  as  the  aged  and  the  young  left  for  the  big  cities  and  universities.  Meanwhile,  the  big  cities,  including  Nashville’s  expanding  job  market,  have  attracted  Jewish  profes  sionals  from  out  of  state.  Through  out  America,  assimilation  is  taking  its  demographic  toll.   Last  year’s  GA  in  Los  Angeles  dealt  extensively  with  Israel’s  security  and  social  welfare  in  the  wake  of  the  Sec  ond  Lebanon  War.  Next  year’s  GA  will  bring  thousands  of  American  Jews  to  Jerusalem.

"  UK  BOARD  SHUNS  ANTI-GAY  PROTEST     DAVID  BYERS     LONDON  -  The  British  Jewish  com-  munity  has  disassociated  itself  from  a  Christian-led  protest  mounted  this  week  outside  the  British  Parliament  against  gay-rights  legislation.   The  umbrella  Board  of  Deputies  of  British  Jews  says  that  although  it  has   reservations  about  the  Government’s  Sexual  Orientation  Regulations,  it  is  not  joining  a  torchlight  protest  against  the  plans,  and  does  not  believe  any  fringe  Jewish  groupings  from  the  UK  are  doing  so  either.   The  legislation  would  ban  discrim-  ination  in  the  provision  of  goods,  facilities  and  services  on  the  basis  of  sexuality  in  a  similar  way  to  the  rules   on  sexual  discrimination  and  racial  discrimination.   Some  Christian  and  Muslim  organisations  organised  a  demonstra-  tion  against  the  rules,  claiming  they  would  “actively  condone  and  pro-  mote”  gay  sex.   In  particular,  religious  Catholic  adoption  agencies  have  said  they  fear  they  may  be  forced  to  allow  gay  cou-  ples  to  adopt.   Last  week,  the  board  issued  a  state-  ment  claiming  the  new  laws  must  not  restrict  Jewish  community  members’  “freedom  of  conscience  and  convic-  tion”  at  the  same  time.   But  now  the  organisation  appeared  to  give  a  guarded  welcome  to  the  rules  if  phrased  with  the  correct  safeguards,  saying:  “The  Sexual  Orientation  Reg-  ulations  will  provide  a  further  plat-   form  to  combat  discrimination  in  this   country.

"  Local  Jewish  leaders  at  odds  over  Latin  Mass   PETER  KOHN   A  LEADING  advocate  for  Jewish  Christian  relations  has  dismissed  Jew  ish  reactions  in  Australia  and  overseas   to  Pope  Benedict  XVTs  decision  to  revive  the  Latin  Mass  as  “knee  jerk”   Rabbi  John  Levi,  emeritus  rabbi  of  the  Union  for  Progressive  Judaism  and   a  co-founder  of  the  Council  of  Chris  tians  and  Jews,  said  the  revival  of  the  Latin  Mass  does  not  automatically  mean  the  prayer  for  the  Jews’  conver  sion,  one  of  several  in  the  mass,  would  be  used   “It  is  inconceivable  to  think  that  [Catholic  Archbishop]  Cardinal  [George]  Pell  would  sanction  such  a  thing,”  Rabbi  Levi  told  the  AJN.  “Nobody  could  have  been  more  faith  ful  in  implementing  the  resolutions  of  Vatican  II  [the  reformist  Second  Ecu  menical  Council  of  the  early  1960s].”   He  said  the  conversion  prayer,  which  is  used  on  Good  Friday  and  calls  on  the  Jews  to  “acknowledge  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ”,  is  among  sections  of  the  Latin  Mass  removed  under  Vatican  II.   Rabbi  Levi’s  comments  follow  the  B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Com   mission’s  (ADC’s)  move  to  ask  Catholic  authorities  whether  they  will  use  the  conversion  prayer  in  Australian   churches.  The  ADC’s  letter  to  Cardinal  Pell  is  in  line  with  a  protest  by  the  United  States-based  B’nai  B’rith  Anti  Defamation  League  and  the  Simon   Wiesenthal  Centre.   In  a  letter  to  Cardinal  Pell,  ADC  executive  officer  Manny  Waks  said  the   ADC  understands  use  of  the  Latin  Mass  will  be  at  the  discretion  of  local   bishops.

"  Students  in  dose  encounter   JOSHUA  LEVI   IT  isn't  often  that  Jewish,  Christian  and  Muslim  teenagers  can  gather  together  to  hear  the  Koran,  discuss  the  way  to  put  on  tefillin  and  learn  about  the  Holy  Trinity,  but  that  is  the  forum  Youth  Encounters  offers.       Around  100  students  from  Moriah  College,  the  Emanuel  School,  Kincoppal  Rose  Bay  and  Sule  Col-  lege  spent  Sunday  in  dialogue  at  Youth  Encounters,  an  inter-faith  bridge-building  program  designed  by  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies.       One  of  the  students  from  Sule  College,  a  predominantly  Muslim  school  in  Preston,  had  the  Koran  recorded  on  an  mp3  player  with  an  English  translation  and  read  a  por-  tion,  while  a  Moriah  College  student  showed  the  students  how  he  puts  on   his  tefillin  and  explained  the  signifi-  cance  of  aligning  mind  and  heart  for  morning  prayers.       NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  chief  executive  Vic  Alhadeff  said:  “When  students  representing  faith  groups  interact,  the  exchange  empowers  them  to  articulate  their  beliefs,  to  develop  an  understanding  and  acceptance  of  differences  and  to  challenge  racism.  This  program  does  all  of  that  and  is  a  wonderful  antidote  to  racism.”       Youth  Encounters  was  conceived  in  2004  with  three  schools  —  one  from  each  Abrahamic  faith  —  and  60  students,  and  has  expanded  each  year.  A  further  200  students  from  seven  schools  will  come  together  at  two  Youth  Encounters  engagements  later  this  year. ",2007-08-24
"  MOTHER’S  WISDOM   I  REFER  to  your  editorial  (AJN  27/4),  aptly  titled  “Persistence  pays  off”.  The  conviction  of  Simon  Phillip  Christian  recently  by  a  Victorian  Court  for  anti  semitic  violence  against  Menachem  Vorchheimer  is  a  simple  message:  you  won’t  get  away  with  vilification  against   Jews.   This  young  offender  needs  to  spend  time  with  a  Holocaust  survivor  to  understand  that  the  suffering  they  endured  under  a  regime  of  hate  was  real,  and  to  learn  some  understanding  of  empathy  for  other  human  beings.   My  late  mother  Patricia  Bums  always  said:  “It  is  not  the  resented  who  suffer;  they  are  usually  unaware  of  your  resentment  It  is  the  resenter  who  does  the  suffering.”   My  mother’s  wisdom  can’t  be  dial   lenged  on  this.

"  Rabbi  Cohen’s  mission  to  stop  missionaries   YONIBASHAN   A  SYDNEY  rabbi  is  on  a  mission  to  expose  the  “threat  of  Christian  mis  sionaries”,  who  persuade  Jews  to  abandon  their  faith  and  convert  to  Christianity.   Rabbi  Eh  Cohen  says  missionary  groups  are  targeting  vulnerable  Jews  and  persuading  them  to  become  more  devout  by  coercing  them  into  believing  that  Jesus  is  God.   Rabbi  Ell  Cohen...  fighting  missionary  zeal.   The  concerned  rabbi  has  opened  the  CBD  Chabad  Centre,  a  not-for  profit  drop-in  centre,  with  the  aim  of  stymieing  the  missionaries’  field  of  influence.   Rabbi  Cohen  estimates  around   300,000  Jews  have  been  converted  by  missionaries,  who  “masquerade  Christian  beliefs  in  the  guise  of  Judaism”  and  tell  recruits  they  aren’t  “complete  Jews”  until  they  accept   Jesus  as  the  Messiah.   They  include  the  Sydney  and  Melbourne-based  Jews  for  Jesus  and  Celebrate  Messiah.   Rabbi  Cohen  told  the  AJN  about  New  Zealand’s  Hosting  Israeli  Trav  ellers  (HIT)  service,  which  billets  cash-strapped  Israelis  to  family  homes  filled  with  “pictures  of  Jesus  and  crosses  all  over  the  place”.   When  the  tourists  depart  New  Zealand  for  Australia,  they’re  net  worked  with  receiver  groups  like  Jews  for  Jesus.   “It’s  the  way  they  do  it  -  they’re  not  up  front  in  their  message,”  Rabbi  Cohen  said.  “Normal  Christians  will  say,  ‘We  want  you  to  convert,  leave  your  religion  and  become  Christian’.  Here  they’re  saying,  ‘We’re  not  asking  you  to  convert,  you’ll  wear  a  tallis  and  have  a  bar  mitzvah.’  [But]  they  don’t  tell  them  that  what  Christianity  really   believes  is  that  Jesus  is  God.”   The  CBD  Chabad  Centre  is  an  arm  of  the  Chabad  Lubavitch  Organisation,  which  does  similar  anti-missionary  work  on  an  interna   tional  level.   Rabbi  Cohen  said  he’ll  provide  educational  material  on  the  mission  aries’  intentions,  and  suggested  responses  to  difuse  their  arguments.   Jews  for  Jesus’  acting  spokesman,  Mark  Landrum,  told  the  AJN  his  group  is  commonly  accused  of  mis  leading  people,  but  says  the  organi  has  nothing  to  hide.   The  signage  outside  the  Bondi  Junction  shop  clearly  outlines  the  organisation’s  belief  in  Jesus  as  the  Messiah,  he  said.   “I  don’t  know  how  much  more  up  front  you  can  get  than  the  sign  out  front  of  the  shop  which  says  ‘Jews  for  Jesus’.”   Despite  keeping  Jewish  traditions,  Landrum  insisted  the  group  isn’t  promoting  Judaism,  and  said  Jews  for  Jesus  is  another  branch  of  a  faith  with  many  sects.   “There  are  all  different  aspects  of  Jews  who  don’t  agree  with  each  other  ...  The  Orthodox  disagree  with  the  Reform  and  the  other  way  around.” ",2007-03-02
"  Haifa  rocket  attack  hero   dies  -  one  year  later   HAIFA  -  Mohammed  (Don)  Salum,  41,  was  buried  in  the  Haifa  Christian  Cemetery  a  year  after  a  Katyusha  rocket  struck  his  home  during  the   Second  Lebanon  War.   His  family  charged  that  it  took  his  death  to  propel  the  city  to  promise  to  rebuild  his  home,  which  had  been  left  in  a  state  of  disrepair  while  he  lay  in  Rambam  Hospital’s  intensive-care   unit.   Hundreds  of  relatives  and  friends  joined  the  funeral  procession,  which  began  at  the  spot  where  the  Katyusha   struck  the  house.   Ignoring  his  own  shrapnel  wounds,  Salum  -  a  lifeguard  at  a  Haifa  beach  -  had  raced  into  his   home  to  rescue  his  mother  and  sister.   He  was  injured  further  when  a  gas  canister  exploded  in  the  house  during   his  rescue.

"  PERSECUTED  CHRISTIANS   fATAH  supporters  haven  t  been  the  only  victims  of  Hamas’  Islamist  vio  lence  in  recent  days.  Gaza’s  tiny  Christian  community  has  reported  rocket  and  arson  attacks,  with  Bibles  defiled  and  churches  burned  down  to  the  tune  of  half-a-million  dollars.   Unfortunately,  there  is  little  point  them  fleeing  to  the  West  Bank,  because  life  under  the  Palestinian  Authority  (PA)  has  been  just  as  hard  there.  Since  the  PA’s  1994  establish  ment,  Bethlehem’s  Christians  have  been  beaten,  raped,  murdered  and  robbed  by  Fatah  and  Hamas  supporters.   While  the  Palestinian  Christian   population  has  been  plummeting,  Israel’s  Christian  Arab  population  has  risen  handsomely.  Why?  Because   Christian  and  Muslim  Israelis  have   the  same  civil  rights  as  Jewish   Israelis.  This  includes  freedom  of  speech  and  religion,  freedom  to  vote  and  to  protest.   Compare  that  to  the  rights  of  everyone  else  -  Muslim  and  non  Muslim  -  in  the  Middle  East  and  it’s  easy  to  see  why  Palestinian  Chris  tians  want  to  live  in  Israel,  but  not  in  the  Palestinian  Authority.

"  Preaching  the  wrong  gospel   A  constant  stream  of  Israel  bashing  highlighted  the   absurdity  that  was  the  visit  to  Australia  by  the  mayor  of   Bethlehem,  Dr  Victor  Batarseh.   VIEWPOINT   ALAN  GOLD   i   Although  a  Catholic...  Dr  Batarseh  is  widely   regarded  as  little  more  than  a  figurehead  representing   Bethlehem's  non   Christian  bullyboys.   WHAT’S  the  most  famous   and  revered  Christian  city   in  the  world?  Most   people  would  nominate   Bethlehem,  the  Biblical  birthplace  ot  Jesus  and  one  of  the  most  sacred  places  in  Christology.  It’s  also  sacred  to  Jews,  as  our  own  King  David  was  also  bom  there  and  was  anointed  by  Samuel  within  its  walls.  Rachel’s  tomb  also  lies  within  the  city’s  outskirts.   Since  ancient  times,  Bethlehem  has  enjoyed  a  large  Christian  population,  which  traditionally  swells  by  many  tens  of  thousands  of  pilgrims  at  Christmastime.  Certainly  for  most  of  the  20th  century,  until  Arafat’s  return  as  supremo  of  the  West  Bank,  Beth  lehem  has  been  a  majority  Christian  town.  Not  any  more.  In  1948,  Beth  lehem  was  85  per  cent  Christian;  today,  around  10  per  cent  of  its  60,000  population  is  Christian,  and  the  number  is  falling  by  the  day.  Christians  are  being  forced  out  because  of  the  desecration  of  their  holy  places,  and  because  of  assaults  against  them  by  their  Islamic  neighbours.  By  defini  tion,  this  is  ethnic  cleansing.   The  current  population  has  dwin  dled  so  alarmingly  that  a  high-level  delegation  made  up  of  the  Archbishop  of  Canterbury  and  the  head  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  in  England  visited  the  city  recently  to  support  those  remaining  Christians.  It  was  a  pity  that  the  one  thing  the  media  picked  up  on  during  their  visit  was  criticism  of  the  separation  barrier.   Israel,  of  course,  has  been  blamed  by  the  world’s  media  for  the  demise  of  the  Palestinian  Christian  population,  but  this  nonsense  is  palpably  untrue.  The  population  of  Christians  is  dimin  ishing  in  all  Muslim  countries  because  of  the  hatred  and  violence  they  are   experiencing,  the  burning  of  churches   and  the  murder  of  innocents.  But   there’s  one  exception  in  the  Middle  East  and  that’s  Israel,  where  the  Chris  tian  population  is  actually  growing  strongly.   This  religious  tolerance  by  Israel  to   all  faiths  doesn’t  fit  well  with  the  vic  timhood  mentality  of  Dr  Victor  Batarseh,  the  mayor  of  Bethlehem,  who  recently  visited  Australia  to  receive  the  honour  of  twin-city  status  with  Marrickville  Council.  Although  a  Catholic  -  the  constitution  of  Beth  lehem  determines  that  the  Mayor  will  be  Christian  -  Dr  Batarseh  is  widely  regarded  as  little  more  than  a  figure  head  representing  Bethlehem’s  non  Christian  bullyboys.   Having  been  wined  and  dined  by  the  good  burghers  of  Marrickville  with  its  ratepayers’  money,  Dr  Batarseh  was  unleashed  on  a  University  of  Sydney  audience,  along  with  the  self-pro  moting  anti-Zionist  Anthony  Loewen  stein  and  Palestinian  activist  Randa  Abdel-Fatteh.  During  this  session,  run  by  the  egregious  University  of  Sydney   Centre  for  Peace  and  Conflict  Studies,  Dr  Batarseh  wound  his  audience  up  into  a  frenzy  about  the  hated  separa  tion  wall,  which  he  claimed  had  turned  his  city  into  a  prison.  One  youthful  member  of  the  audience  was  reported  to  have  screamed  out,  “Destroy  Israel”,  to  great  applause.   But  did  the  audience  learn  anything  about  the  situation  of  the  Christians  of   Bethlehem?  While  demanding  that  Australian  academics  join  the  British  boycott  of  Israeli  academics,  did  any  of   the  student  audience  ask  Dr  Batarseh   any  questions  about  why  the  Christian  population  has  diminished  so  markedly?  It  appears  that,  as  long  as  there’s  Israel  to  blame,  other  facts,  such  as  the  ethnic  cleansing  of  Christians,  can  safely  be  ignored.   How  quickly  the  world  has  for  gotten  that  terrorists  stormed  and  des  ecrated  the  Church  of  the  Nativity  in  2002,  holding  dozens  of  priests  and  nuns  hostage.  The  world  also  forgets  that  the  IDF  could  so  easily  have  burst  into  the  church  and  lolled  all  the  ter  rorists,  but  held  back  for  many  weeks  because  of  their  fear  of  harming  inno  cent  Christian  lives  and  damaging  a  sacred  site.  Ultimately,  the  terrorists  were  given  asylum  in  several  European  countries,  and  a  deal  has  just  been  struck  between  Prime  Minister  Olmert  and  Mahmoud  Abbas  to  repa  triate  them  back  to  the  West  Bank.  To  the  shock  of  the  Christians  of  Beth  lehem,  they  now  have  to  suffer  the   prospect  of  the  return  of  such  men.   The  fact  that  Marrickville  Council  has  twinned  with  the  oppressors  of  Bethlehem,  a  city  run  by  Hamas,  is  now  a  matter  of  public  record  and  shame.  The  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  has  made  its  condemnation  clear,  as  has  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  and  Melbourne  Ports  MP  Michael  Danby.  Alexander  Downer  has  expressed  his  concern,  saying  Marrickville  Council  is  foolish  to  associate  itself  with  people  who  sup  port  terrorist  organisations.  One  has  to  hope  that  Immigration  Minister  Kevin   Andrews  tried  but  failed  to  find  an   adequate  reason  in  law  to  exclude  the   mayor.   So  while  the  Bethlehem  mayor  trips  around  the  world,  twinning  with  this  council  or  that,  who  is  looking  after  the  interests  of  the  city’s  rapidly  dimin  ishing  and  imperiled  Christian  com  munity?  That’s  a  question  that  probably  won’t  be  heard  in  the  cham  bers  of  Marrickville  Council.   Alan  Gold  is  a  Sydney-based  writer. ",2007-09-07
"  Children’s  book  shows  two  sides  of  a  similar  story   Book  review   THE  CAVE  OF   RECONCILIATION   Pecki  Sherman  Wltonsky   Jewish  Publication   Society,  $22   Reviewed  by  Deborah  Stone   A  DOUBLE-SIDED  picture  book  aims  to   help  Muslim,  Jewish  and  Christian  chil  dren  find  their  common  heritage  through  stories  from  the  Bible  and  Koran.   The  Cave  of  Reconciliation  has  two  covers  and  two  forms  of  the  same  story  in  one  book.  Read  in  one  direction,  it  is  An  Abrahamic  Tale  drawn  from  the  Torah;  flipped  over,  it  has  the  same  picture,  but  a  different  subtitle,  An  Ibrahimic  Tale,  and  is  based  on  sources  in  the  Koran.   Both  stories  use  colourful  collage  pictures,  maps  and  descriptive  storytelling  to  retell  the  biblical  stories  of  Abraham/Ibrahim,  culmi   nating  in  the  burial  of  the  patriarch  at  the  Cave  of  Machpelah  (Tomb  of  the  Patriarchs),  known  to  Muslims  as  the  Ibrahimi  Mosque,  in  the  now  much-disputed  territory  of  Hebron.   Author  Pecki  Sherman  Witonsky  describes  the  book  as  “a  gift  in  the  service  of  healing  and  peace”.  She  was  inspired  to  create  it  after  being  asked  to  speak  about  the  story  of  Isaac  and  Ishmael  in  synagogue  on  Rosh  Hashanah  in  2001.   “At  the  time,  the  second  intifada  had  heated  up  and  bullets  were  flying  from  both  sides  of  Israel’s  borders  and  I  felt  very  uncomfortable  with  the  topic  I  had  been  assigned,”  she  said.   Published  by  the  Jewish  Publication  Society,  the  design  of  the  book  sets  up  a  clear  message  that  neither  version  of  the  story  takes  priority  over  the  other.  The  different  versions,  and  sometimes  contradictions,  in  the  stories  are  presented  as  different  tradi  tions  that  can  be  equally  read  and  respected.   While  Jewish  and  Christian  children  might  start  reading  in  one  direction  and  Muslim  chil   A  collage  illustration  of  Abraham  and  his  two  sons,  Isaac  and  Ishmael.   dren  in  the  other,  the  intention  is  that  they  lit  erally  meet  in  the  middle,  where  a  short  verti  cal  section  offers  shared  information.   Another  asset  of  the  book  is  the  ability  for  readers  of  either  tradition  to  compare  the  dif   ferent  versions  of  familiar  stories,  an  exercise  that  is  likely  to  be  educational  for  adults  as  well  as  children.   Jewish  readers,  familiar  with  the  story  in  which  God  asks  Abraham  to  sacrifice  Isaac,  will  be  interested  to  learn  that  in  the  Koran  it  is  Satan  -  posing  as  God  -  who  makes  the  demand  of  Ibrahim  and  that  he  is  asked  to  sacrifice  Ismail  (the  Arabic  version  of  Ishmael),  not  Isaac.   There  are  also  additional  stories  that  appear  in  one  version  only,  that  provide  a   new  perspective  on  the  characters.   One  of  the  challenges  for  Witonsky  was  the  fact  that  while  the  story  of  Abraham  is  a  key  narrative  in  the  Torah,  the  Ibrahimic  nar  rative  in  the  Koran  is  not  continuous  and  omits  many  details.  She  got  around  this  prob  lem  by  supplementing  the  Koranic  narrative  with  Jewish  biblical  sources  that  were  con  sistent  with  the  oral  Islamic  traditions.   The  book  has  received  widespread  endorsements  from  inter-faith  leaders.   Deborah  Stone  is  the  AJN's  literary  editor. ",2007-05-25

"  Federal  Treasurer  Peter  Costello  is  a  friend  of  Israel  and  of  the  Jewish  community.  In  this  exclusive  interview,  he  tells  what  forged  his  connection  to  Australian  Jewry  and  why  his  government  is  unwavering  in  its  support  for  Israel.   ETER  Costello,  staunch  Christian  and  brother  of  a   Baptist  minister,  has  a   menorah  in  his  office.   It  is  a  beautiful  silver  candelabra,  sturdy  but  dainty,  and  is  kept  in  a  small  cabinet  surrounded  by  assorted  memorabilia  from  his  past  11  years  as  federal  treasurer.   Displayed  in  Costello’s  office,  it  is  a  symbol  of  his  deep-rooted  connection  with  the  Jewish  community  that  he  first  encountered  30  years  ago  when  knee-deep  in  the  dirty  pool  that  was  student  politics  of  the  time.   In  the  lead-up  to  what  is  becoming  his  party’s  toughest  election  battle  for  a  generation,  the  federal  treasurer  spoke  to  the  AJN  in  his  Melbourne  office.  In  an  all-encompassing  inter  view,  Costello  who  is  often  speculated  about  as  a  future  prime  minister,  opened  up  on  domestic  issues,  his  thoughts  on  the  Jewish  community  and  his  unwavering  support  of  Israel.   Costello,  50,  has  been  a  strong  sup  porter  of  the  Jewish  community  since  his  student  days  at  Monash  University   in  the  mid-  to  late-1970s.  More   recently,  he  has  supported  the  com  munity  by  speaking  up  for  Israel  and  by  attending  Jewish  fundraising  events  and  functions.  As  the  Member   for  Higgins,  he  also  has  a  reasonable  number  of  Jewish  constituents.   It  was  in  his  university  years,  though,  that  he  first  became  involved  in  the  pro-Israel  lobby,  making  friends  with  a  number  of  key  Jewish  figures  in  student  politics,  including  Michael  Danby,  now  a  Labor  MR   “I  got  involved  with  the  Jewish  community  really  in  the  mid-1970s  when  I  was  a  student  leader  at  Monash  University,  fighting  the  extreme-left  Australian  Union  of  Stu  dents  (AUS),”  Costello  recalled.   “At  that  point,  the  AUS  was  send   ing  money  to  the  PLO  [Palestine  Lib  eration  Organisation]  and  it  was  the  height  of  the  PLO’s  terrorist  campaign  where  they  had  been  hijacking  jets.  I  was  genuinely  offended  and  outraged  that  Australian  student  money  could  be  hijacked  into  supporting  an  organ  isation  which,  at  that  time,  was  clearly  engaged  in  terror.   “So  I  started  campaigning  against  that  and  got  a  lot  of  support  from  the  Jewish  student  groups  -  Adam  Slonim  at  Monash,  Joe  Gersh  at  Mel  bourne  University  -  and  really  throughout  Australia.”   Costello  first  visited  Israel,  includ  ing  Jerusalem,  Gaza  and  the  Golan  Heights,  as  a  guest  of  the  Australasian  Union  of  Jewish  Students  in  1979.  He  has  since  returned  to  the  country  a  number  of  times,  most  recently  in   2003.   “I  was  there  three  years  ago  and  I  met  Ariel  Sharon,  who  was  then  prime  minister,  Binyamin  Netanyahu  and  Shimon  Peres,  who  is  now  the  president,”  he  said.   “I  had  a  very  bad  cold  when  I  was   in  Israel  and  Shimon  Peres  went  out   and  got  me  some  cough  mixture  to  treat  my  bad  cold,  which  was  a  very  nice  thing  to  do.”   His  experiences  with  Israel  and  with  supporters  of  Israel  have  shaped  his  perspective  on  the  tiny  country  and  have  encouraged  his  strident  backing  for  Israel’s  right  to  exist  and  prosper.   It  is  evident  that  one  of  the  things  of  which  Costello  is  most  proud  is  the  government’s  record  of  voting  against  those  who  seek  to  destabilise  or  endanger  the  Jewish  homeland  in  the   United  Nations  and  other  interna  tional  organisations.   ""We  are  a  country  that  understands  where  our  interests  lie  and  where  we  think  global  interests  reside  and  we  stand  up  for  those  interests,”  he  said.   He  admitted  that  the  Howard  Government  has  copped  flack,  both  domestically  and  internationally,  for  its  unwavering  support  of  Israel,  but  he  said  that  it  will  continue  unperturbed.   “There  will  be  other  countries   that  don’t  vote  the  way  we  do  and  will  be  critical,  but  the  fact  of  the  matter  is  we  have  a  strong  conception  of  our  national  interest  and  our  global  interest  and  we  will  stick  with  that.”  He  added:  “We  are  always  happy  to  discuss  with  other  countries  their  criticism  of  us  but,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  we  won’t  alter  our  voting  because   of  them.”   “We  are  a  country  that   understands  where  our  interests  lie  and  where   we  think  global  interests  reside  and  we  stand  up  for  those  interests.""   PETER  COSTELLO  Federal  treasurer   Interestingly,  he  said  that  he  believes  a  strong  commitment  to  Israel  is  the  paramount  issue  for  Jew  ish  voters  as  they  head  to  the  polls  later  this  year.   “I  think  that  the  most  important  issue  for  the  Jewish  community  is  that  they  want  a  government  that  will  stand  up  for  Israel  and  which  won’t  be  subject  to  diplomatic  pressure  in  international  forums  or  elsewhere  to  take  a  less  supportive  role,”  he  said.   “I  think,  outside  of  that,  the  biggest  issues  for  the  Jewish  commu  nity  are  who  is  going  to  run  the  coun  try  in  a  way  that  will  create  growth,  look  after  my  business,  find  jobs  for  my  kids  and  keep  interest  rates  low.”   This  is  a  revealing  insight,  espe   dally  considering  how  keen  both  the  government  and  the  Opposition  have  been  in  recent  weeks  to  court  Jewish  voters  with  announcements  on  secu   rity  and  changes  to  school  funding.   One  of  the  pre-election  promises  that  Costello  is  keen  to  promote  is  the  decision  in  early  August  to  grant  tax  deductibility  to  the  Council  for  Jew  ish  Community  Security,  thereby  making  all  donations  for  Jewish  secu  rity  tax  deductible.  “I  think  it  is  a  very  long-term  solution  [to  the  burden  of  security  funding]  because  it  is  not  capped  -  it  is  not  like  a  grant  program  that  has  to  be  renewed  year  by  year  through  the  budget  process,”  he   boasted.   “You  can’t  do  better  than  full  tax  deductibility  -  that  is  the  best  treat  ment  you  can  get  under  Australian   tax  law.”   HEN  pushed  further  about  alleviating  the  security  bur  den,  Costello  dug  his  heels  in.  He  was  asked  whether  the  Coalition  would  match  the  Opposition’s  prom  ise  to  set  aside  $20  million  for  school’s  security  if  it  wins  government  and  replied  rather  cryptically.   “It  is  like  someone  giving  you  a  Mini  Minor  and  then  getting  a  Rolls  Royce  but  asking  if  you  can  have  a  Mini  Minor  as  well.  Your  Rolls  Royce  will  take  you  a  lot  further,”  he  boomed.   “Tax  deductibility  could  be  worth  $100  million  but  it  depends  how  much  you  are  willing  to  put  into  it.  It  is  much  better  than  $20  million.  Take  it  from  me,  if  you  are  ever  offered  tax  deductibility  or  a  grant,  take  the  tax  deductibility.”   Just  a  few  weeks  before  the  tax  deductibility  announcement,  the  gov  ernment  revealed  that,  after  a  decade  of  lobbying  from  the  Australian  Coordinating  Committee  of  Jewish   Day  Schools,  it  would  amend  the  socioeconomic  status  (SES)  funding  model,  a  policy  that  now  has  biparti  san  support.   Costello  warned  that  even  though  the  ALP  supports  the  government’s  changes  to  SES  funding,  a  vote  for  Labor  would  be  a  vote  for  a  funding  cut  for  independent  schools.   “The  Labor  unions  are  complain  ing  that  we  put  too  much  money  into  independent  schools,”  Costello  said.  “I  haven’t  seen  Mr  Rudd’s  policy  yet,  but  knowing  the  Australian  education  unions  as  I  do,  if  there  is  a  Labor  gov  ernment,  the  pressure  will  be  on  to  reduce  funding  to  independent   schools.”   Costello’s  concerns  about  a  future  Kevin  Rudd-Labor  government  are  real.  Newspoll  figures  indicate  that  the  ALP  will  sweep  to  power  with  a  commanding  majority.  The  latest  polls  show  that  Labor  has  59  per  cent  of  the  two-party  preferred  vote.   Fortunately  for  his  party  and  sup  porters,  the  treasurer  is  under  no  illu  sion  as  to  how  tough  it  will  be  for  the  government  to  hold  on.   “This  is  going  to  be  a  tough  elec  tion,  no  doubt  about  it,”  he  said.   “Rudd  is  in  front  and  he  thinks  he   is  cruising  to  a  victory  but  I  don’t  think  this  election  is  over  yet.”   “We  can  keep  the  Australian  econ  omy  strong,  keep  people  at  work,  keep  businesses  profitable,  manage  interest  rates,  manage  financial  insta  bility  which  is  going  to  come  to  us  from  around  the  world,”  he  said.   “We  can  stand  up  to  unions,  which  will  be  let  loose  by  a  Rudd  gov  ernment  and  affect  the  building  industry  and  inflation  and  interest  rates,  and  we  can  secure  the  country  in  a  way  that  it  needs  to  be  secured  from  those  who  wish  ill  from  within  and  from  without.” ",2007-09-14
"  qu   Rabbi  Jonathan  Magoriet   Inter-faith  activist/emeritus  Bible  professor   at  Leo  Baeck  College,  London   How  has  your  inter-faith  work  with  the  annual  Jewish-Christian  Muslim  student  conference  in  Bendorf,  Germany,  improved   relations  between  the  three  faiths?   We  have  between  80  and  100  people  each  year  and  it’s  been  going  now  for  35  years.  Most  of  the  people  who  come  will  have  some  sort  of  leadership  role  within  their  community.  All  rabbinical  students  at  Leo  Baeck  College,  as  part  of  their  training,  attend  the  conference  at  least  once.  There  are  Christian  theology  students,  there  are  Muslims.  The  Muslims  aren’t  organised  in  Europe  in  the  same  way  as  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  terms  of  colleges,  so  we  tend  to  find  community  workers,  social  workers,  people  who  have  a  leading  role  within  their  communities.  Over  the  past  30  years  or  so,  in  many  of  the  inter-faith  conferences  I’ve  gone  to,  I’ve  come  across  people  who  have  told  me  they  were  at  the  Bendorf  conference  and  have  gone  on  to  continue  this  work,  so  it  has  an  influence  on  individuals  and  is  seen  by  many  as  a  model  for  when  things  get  tough.   What  is  die  relevance  off  holding  this  conference  In  Germany,  with  all  tihe  historical  and  emodonal  baggage  this  carries  for  Jews?   The  reason  it  started  there  was  that  a  German  pastor  and  an  English  rabbi  (Lionel  Blue)  wondered  if  instead  of  just  brooding  about  the  past,  was  there  something  the  church  in  Germany  could  do  to  help  the  Jewish  people?  One  of  the  ideas  that  arose  was  that,  with  the  con  flict  in  the  Middle  East,  there  must  be  a  way  in  which  the  three  great  religions  can  offer  something  helpful.  So  why  can’t  the  church  medi  ate  and  provide  the  place  where  Jews  and  Muslims  could  meet?  When  the  three  faiths  meet,  they  each  have  a  different  agenda.  The  Jews  have  this  question  about  Germany,  the  Christians  are  looking  back  at  their  past,  and  for  Muslims,  it’s  neutral  territory,  but  they  have  prob  lems  with  their  role  as  a  minority  in  Europe.   You’ve  spoken  off  literary  ^  approaches  to  biblical  stud  ‘nraS,  ‘es  ^  you’ve  pioneered.   vH^  Can  you  explain  those?   When  I  started  studying   fl|  and  teaching  Bible  40  ^lpl|  years  ago,  the  main   stream  way  of  reading  the  Bible  was  “historical  critical”,  to  discover,  if  you  could,  the  origins  of  the  texts  that  were  edited  together  to  become  the  Bible.  It  was  almost  a  kind  of  debunking  of  the  Bible.  I  was  interested  in  the  final  text  we   have  in  front  of  us,  how  it   holds  together  ...  I   was  lucky  to   be  coming  in  at  the  begin  ning  of  this   new  trend   of  reading  the  book  as  literature,   je  Jews  fftians   Muslims.   have  this  question  about  Germany,  the  are  looking  back  at  their  past,   ..  they  have  problems  ...  as  a  minority.   of  trying  to  understand  better  through  the  Hebrew  the  interconnec  tions  in  the  language.   Do  you  see  a  common  thread  that  brings  together  your  inter-faith  work  and  your  biblical  studies?   I  do,  in  that  there’s  a  kind  of  principle  that  comes  under  the  word  “dialogue”.  In  dialogue  with  others,  you  want  to  try  to  see  the  world  through  their  eyes.  When  you  start  reading  Bible  as  a  dialogue  exercise,  your  interest  is  trying  to  get  inside  the  minds  of  the  composers  of  it.   Are  communal  relations  between  Jews  and  Muslims,  and  between  Islam  and  the  mainstream,  a  cultural  or  more  religious  issue?   It’s  a  mixture  of  the  two.  In  terms  of  Jews  and  Muslims,  everything  is  overshadowed  by  the  Middle  East,  by  the  Israel-Palestine  conflict,  which  makes  for  very  difficult  relations  on  one  level.  But  as  soon  as  Jews  and  Muslims  actually  get  together  and  talk,  we  find  we  have  so  much  in  common  in  terms  of  our  understanding  of  the  world,  of  our  status  as  a  minority,  of  our  traditions,  even  of  our  language.   How  can  we  combat  radical  Islam  through  inter-faith  work?   One  of  the  difficulties  is  that  people  who  go  into  dialogue  tend  to  be  people  who  want  to  meet  each  other,  while  those  who  are  radical  -  on  all  sides  -  feel  much  more  isolated  and  under  threat.  There  is  no  shortcut.  You  have  to  invest  in  the  relationships  you  build  with  the  moderates  because  they  are  the  bridge  to  the  more  radical.  Never  despair  of  not  reaching  them.   Has  Progressive  Judaism  played  a  special  role  in  inter-faith  understanding?   Part  of  the  remit  of  Progressive  Judaism  and  its  responsibility  is  to  be  the  interface  with  the  outside  world.  We  accept  more  easily  that  we  are  part  of  a  broader  society  and  culture  and  have  a  responsibility  towards  it.  Reform,  Progressive,  Liberal  Jews  are  more  open  to  the  encounter.  It’s  easier  for  us  to  meet  with  other  people  and  step  out  side  our  own  boundaries.  If  you  look  at  most  of  the  inter-faith  work,  the  pioneers  have  been  Progressive  Jews,  with  Orthodox  Jews  com  ing  along  subsequently  ...  Temple  Beth  Israel’s  Rabbi  John  Levi  is  a  good  example.  I’ve  known  him  for  30  years  and  have  always  admired  the  role  he’s  played  in  Australia  in  precisely  this  way.   What’s  been  the  most  significant  change  in  the  way  rabbis  are  being  trained  at  Leo  Baeck  College  in  the  past  couple  of  decades?   We’ve  been  able  to  enact  some  kind  of  what  I’d  call  quality  control  over  the  Progressive  Jewish  leadership  of  communities  in  Europe,  with  rabbis  taking  up  posts  not  only  in  the  UK,  but  in  France,  Germany,  Holland,  and  also  now  in  the  former  Soviet  Union.  Also,  I  think  we’ve  pioneered  new  ways  of  understanding  the  role  of  the  rabbi  and  the  need  to  support  rabbis  in  their  postgraduate  work.  Rabbis  tended  in  the  past  to  go  out  in  the  world  and  hope  they’d  sur  vive.  But  we’ve  created  rabbinic  in-service  training,  a  whole  range  of  support  systems  and  also  tried  to  learn  more  about  the  dynamics  of  congregational  life.   You  are  coming  to  Australia  as  the  Union  for  Progressive  Judaism  scholar-in-residence.  What  significance  does  this  have?   I’m  starting  in  New  Zealand  and  I’ll  be  visiting  Melbourne,  Sydney  and  Perth,  with  different  expectations  in  each  of  these  places.  Is  this  your  first  trip  to  Australia?

Lawyers  for  Ocean  Grove  foot  baller  Simon  Phillip  Christian  told  the  Melbourne  Magistrate’s  Court  on  Wednesday  that  their  client   shouted  the  abuse  from  a  minibus  window  as  Vorchheimer  walked  to  shul  with  his  children  on  October  14  (Simchat  Torah).   Christian,  21,  was  convicted  of  one  count  of  assault  using  insulting  language.  Outside  court,  Vorch  heimer  told  reporters  he  was   satisfied  with  the  sentence.  “From   my  point  of  view  it  [the  outcome]  was  very  reassuring.  It’s  not  about   the  [severity  of  the]  penalty,  but  the  conviction  and  the  upholding  of  the  law,”  Vorchheimer  told  the  AJN.   Earlier  this  week,  Christian  par  ticipated  in  a  diversion  program,  which  could  have  seen  him  apolo  gising  to  his  victim  in  public  and  visiting  the  Jewish  Holocaust  Museum  and  Research  Centre,  but  which  subsequently  failed,  forcing   the  matter  to  court.   Magistrate  Barbara  Cotterell  dis  missed  claims  by  Christian’s  defence  lawyer  that  the  remarks  were  an  alcohol-induced  slip.  “I  don’t  accept  that  [it  was  slip].  His  behaviour  was  extremely  racist,”  Magistrate  Cot  terell  told  the  court.  “You  must  be  living  in  a  vacuum  to  not  know  what  [‘Go  Nazis’]  means.”   During  police  questioning,   Christian  conceded  that  his  remarks   were  offensive  to  Jewish  people.   The  other  two  defendants,  James  Dalton  and  Matthew  Cuthbert,  are  due  to  appear  in  court  in  June. ",2007-04-20
"  ?   Coming  from  overseas  to  Australia  to  study  is  always  a  daunting  experience.  Taken  out  of  your  comfort  zone,  you  start  depending  on  others  in  order  to  make  your  life  run  smoother.  Some  students  start  depending  on  God.  I  spoke  to  one  of  these,  Jessica  Halim,  about  her  experiences  in  Australia  and  how  she  became  a  Christian.  Jessica  came  from  Indonesia  four  years  ago,  and  is  in  her  final  semester  of  Food  Science  and  Technology  Honours.  Her  experiences  of  Christianity  in  the  Islamic  country  were  formative  rather  than  personal.  ""My  parents  are  not  Christians  and  we  didn't  go  to  church,  but  I  went  to  a  Christian  high  school  in  Jakarta.  We  had  what  we  called  'Christian  study'  -  equivalent  to  Scripture  class  here  -  which  was  a  compulsory  subject  for  everyone.  So  I  know  some  Bible  stories  from  the  Scripture  classes,  Christian  services  (I  think  it's  called  Chapel  here?)  and  retreats  each  year.  But  I  guess  at  that  time  I  wasn't  really  paying  attention  to  Christianity  at  all,  I  was  studying  the  Christian  subject  just  for  the  sake  of  studying  and  getting  good  marks.  However  I  did  believe  that  God  exists,  and  that's  just  it.  No  connection  with  me  whatsoever.""  When  Jess  came  to  UNSW  she  was  introduced  to  FOCUS  1  ,  an  Anglican  church  on  campus  for  overseas  students.  Her  elder  brother  was  already  a  member.  Her  initial  motivation  for  going  was  to  find  new  friends.  ""At  first  I  thought,  'Oh  yeah,  why  not  go  to  this  Indo  gathering  or  church  where  I  can  make  lots  of  new  friends?  After  all,  I'm  new  to  Sydney,  I  don't  know  anyone  here,  I  don't  have  anything  else  to  do,  I  can  meet  other  Indonesians  and  I   can  learn  how  to  speak  English  better!'  So  yeah,  I  decided  to  come  along  and  the  people  there  were  really  friendly  and  welcoming  to  me.  We  studied  the  Bible  plus  we  had  some  fun  and  socials  as  well,  so  I  was  happy  to  stay  around.  Learning  English  and  socialising  were  my  main  reasons  back  then  but  I  didn't  mind  going  to  a  Christian  church  either.""  Little  by  little,  however,  attending  church  regularly  and  finding  Christian  friends  started  to  change  her  way  of  thinking  and  made  her  seriously  consider  being  a  Christian.  ""I  came  to  FOCUS  church  from  my  first  year  first  semester,  but  it  wasn't  until  on  the  second  semester  that  we  had  Bible  studies  called  Two  Ways  To  Live  (2WTL).  I  mentioned  before  that  I  believed  in  God's  existence  but  that's  just  it,  there  was  no  connection  or  relationship.  I  was  happy  with  it  that  way  and  I  didn't  think  much  about  it.  But  from  the  2WTL  studies,  I  realised  that  all  this  time  that  I  thought  I  was  okay  with  God,  when  actually  I  wasn't.  I  was  ignoring  God  the  Creator  by  not  giving  the  appropriate  response  to  him,  and  God  was  actually  angry  with  that.  I  also  learned  that  only  Jesus  can  take  away  God's  anger,  so  that  I  didn't  have  to  be  punished.  That  leaves  me  two  ways  to  live:  whether  to  accept  Jesus  as  Lord  and  Saviour  and  be  saved,  or  continue  in  my  own  way,  ignoring  God  and  being  ultimately  punished.  Several  weeks  later  I  trusted  Jesus  as  my  Lord  and  Saviour,  and  that's  how  I  became  Christian.""  But  choosing  to  become  Christian  wasn't  easy  for  Jessica.  In  fact,  she  struggled  a  lot  with  the  changes  in  her  life  that  took  place.  ""I  didn't  believe  directly  in  the  2WTL  Bible  studies  when  I  first  heard  them.  But  somehow  there  was  something  that  bothered  me  a  lot.  I  questioned  frequently:  is  that  THE  truth?  Am  I  really  ignoring  God?  Is  there  such  thing   as  eternal  punishment  and  eternal  life?  Is  it  what  it  means  when  people  said  that  Jesus  died  for  you  to  save  you?  Can  I  trust  the  Bible?  You  know,  all  of  those  sorts  of  questions.  I  searched  and  questioned  and  struggled  a  lot.  Thankfully  at  FOCUS  Pelita  (the  Indonesian  church)  there  were  other  Christians  that  helped  me  in  answering  those  questions.  Several  weeks  later,  He  convinced  me  that  all  those  things  are  true  and  I  prayed  that  He  would  forgive  me  from  my  ignorance  all  this  time.  And  he  did.  Since  then,  I  felt  my  life  has  changed.""  Now  Jessica  is  more  comfortable  in  her  new  identity,  and  finds  a  greater  purpose  in  her  life.  ""Before  I  came  to  Australia,  I  was  pretty  much  a  nerd  in  high  school.  That's  because  I  went  to  the  best  private  school  in  the  whole  country,  and  I  really  needed  to  study  hard  in  order  to  survive.  All  I  did  was  study,  study  and  study.  I  felt  stressed  with  life,  doing  nothing  else  except  studying.  But  since  I  became  Christian,  it  became  all  completely  different.  I've  realised  that  life  isn't  just  all  about  studying.  It  wasn't  of  great  importance  to  me  anymore,  as  I've  found  the  purpose  of  life  in  God.  But  that  doesn't  mean  that  I  don't  have  to  study  anymore,  I  still  study  hard.  But  the  difference  is  that  study  is  no  longer  my  main  thing  in  life,  and  I  study  not  for  myself  -  feeling-good-whenever-  I-get-good-marks,  but  relying  on  God's  strength  I  do  it  all  for  his  glory.""  m   'Fellowship  of  Overseas  Christian  University  Students  (FOCUS)  meets  regularly  on  the  Kensington  campus.

"  NOT  REAL  JUDAISM   I  WOULD  like  to  strenuously  dis  agree  with  the  letter  (AJN  31/08)  that  takes  the  position  that  Messianic  Jews  or  members  of  Jews  for  Jesus  repre  sent  an  authentic  form  of  Judaism  because,  even  though  they  worship  Jesus  and  practise  Christianity,  they  were  bom  Jewish.   One  of  the  criticisms  of  Jews  for  Jesus  surrounds  the  tactics  they  employ  in  their  missionary  and  out  reach  programs.  Critics  say  that  the  organisation  uses  vague  and  mislead  ing  language  along  with  deceptive  tac  tics  in  its  attempt  to  convert  Jews  to  Christianity.  These  tactics  include  statements  that  Jesus  is  the  fulfilment  of  the  Jewish  prophecy  of  the  Messiah   and  attempts  by  Jews  for  Jesus  to  interpret  core  principles  of  Judaism  in  an  effort  to  bring  these  Jewish  princi  ples  into  accord  with  Christian  doc   trines.   To  this  end,  critics  say  that  Jews  for  Jesus  uses  the  ambiguity  in  the  defini  tion  of  “Jew”  and  “Jewish”  to  confuse  their  prospective  converts  into  believ  ing  there  is  a  possibility  of  one  being  a  follower  of  both  Judaism  and  Chris  tianity  simultaneously.  However,  belief  in  Jesus  as  deity,  son  of  God  or  Christ  is  held  as  incompatible  with  Judaism.   Although  members  of  Jews  for  Jesus  believe  their  views  of  the  Mes  siah  are  entirely  compatible  with  the  view  of  God  presented  in  Jewish  scriptures,  and  that  the  doctrine  of  the  Trinity,  fundamental  to  the  Chris  tian  faith,  is  not  entirely  alien  to  Judaism,  these  interpretations  are  rejected  by  Judaism.   The  director  of  a  counter-mission   ary  group,  Torah  Atlanta  Rabbi  Eff  aim  Davidson,  stated  that  “Jews  for  Jesus  use  aggressive  proselytising  to  target  disenfranchised  or  unaffiliated  Jews,  Russian  immigrants  and  college  students”  and  that  “their  techniques  are  manipulative,  deceptive  and   antisemitic”.

"  WORLD  VIEW   TUTU  IMPLORES  JEWS  TO  STOP  OPPRESSION   BOSTON  -  Archbishop  Desmond  Tutu  has  issued  an  impassioned  plea  to  the  Jewish  people  to  end  Israel's  oppres  sion  of  Palestinians.  Speaking  in  Boston  during  a  two-day  conference  titled  the  Apartheid  Paradigm  in  Pales  tine-lsrael,  the  Nobel  laureate  urged  Jews  to  heed  the  call  of  their  God  and  act  appropriately.  The  conference  was  sponsored  by  Sabeel,  a  Palestinian  Christian  organisation,  and  sparked  protests  by  local  Jewish  community  institutions  and  synagogues.  The  exec  utive  director  of  the  New  England  region  of  the  Anti-Defamation  League,  Andrew  Tarsy,  rejected  the  apartheid  analogy.  Tarsy  said  he  was  disap  pointed  that  a  man  of  Tutu’s  moral  stature  would  use  his  credibility  to  bol  ster  Sabeel,  which  he  and  others  say  use  Christian  imagery  and  language  to   vilify  Israel.

We  live  in  a  democracy,  which   means  that  individuals  are  free  to   pursue  whatever  religious  paths  they  choose  (within  the  law).   Tolerance  is  not  the  issue.  The  issue  is  that  one  cannot  be  both  Jewish  and  Christian  at  the  same  time.  They  are  two  distinct  religions,  and  there  are  several  Christian  concepts  that  are  incompatible  with  Judaism.  It  is  there  fore  disingenuous  to  claim  that  it  is  possible  to  belong  to  both  religions,  and  doing  so  is  offensive  to  both.

"  Rabbi  Ell  Cohen  (right)  handing  out  promotional  material  for  Jews  for  Judaism.   Jews  for  Judaism  comes  to  Sydney   LEXI  LANDSMAN   A  BRANCH  of  the  international   counter-missionary  organisation  Jews  for  Judaism  has  opened  in  Aus   tralia.   Headed  by  Rabbi  Eli  Cohen,  the  organisation’s  mission  is  to  serve  the  Jewish  community  by  combating  proselytising  groups  that  target  Jews  for  conversion  to  Christianity.   Rabbi  Cohen,  director  of  the  Sydney  branch  based  in  the  city,  has  been  working  closely  with  Jews  for  Judaism  of  North  America  for  the  past  two  years.   “The  threat  is  real,  but  still  undercurrent,  and  there  has  been  no  organisation  that  has  officially  taken  on  the  responsibility  to  combat  [proselytising  groups]  in  the  whole  of  Australia,”  Rabbi  Cohen  explained.   “The  Sydney  branch  is  working  with  the  Jewish  community  to  inoc  ulate  the  community  from  the  mis  sionaries  and  to  bring  back  those  Jews  who  have  been  lured  away  from  Judaism  to  Christianity.”   Rabbi  Cohen,  29,  who  was  bom  in  London  and  moved  to  Sydney  in  2004,  believes  there  are  more  than  half-a-dozen  missionary  groups  actively  targeting  Jews  for  conver   Jewellery  sold  by  Jews  for  Jesus.

Among  them  are  members  of  the  Jerusalem  Baptist  Church,  Christian  Witnesses  to  Israel,  Celebrate  Mes  siah  Australia,  Jews  for  Jesus  and  countless  other  Christian  groups  worldwide  that  engage  in  prose  lytising  activities.   “The  idea  of  these  groups  is  to   blur  the  distinctions  between   Judaism  and  Christianity,  and  to  make  the  Jew  feel  comfortable  accepting  the  Christian  faith  in  addition  to  Jewish  faith,  with  the  claim  that  by  doing  so  one  becomes  a  completed  Jew  or  a  better  Jew,”  Rabbi  Cohen  explained.   Many  proselytisers  believe  that  in  order  for  Jesus  to  return  the  Jewish  people  must  first  be  converted  to  Christianity.   According  to  a  Council  of  Jewish  Federations  population  study  in  1990,  more  than  275,000  Jews  across  the  world  were  converted  by  prose  lytising  groups  over  a  25-year  period.   Missionaries  often  target  univer  sity  campuses,  hospitals,  drug-reha  bilitation  programs,  aged-cared  residences,  shopping  malls  in  Jewish  neighbourhoods,  and  the  Israeli  community,  including  inter-mar  ried  couples.   Jews  for  Judaism,  which  was  established  in  1985,  is  an  interna  tional  organisation.

"  Embassy  slams  church   leader  over  fence  remarks   NAOMI  LEVIN   CRITICISM  of  Israel’s  security  fence  from  the  Anglican  Primate  of   Australia  has  been  met  with  a  firm   rebuke  from  the  Israeli  Embassy.   Archbishop  Philip  Aspinall,  the  leader  of  the  Australian  Anglican  Church  who  was  visiting  the  region  as  part  of  a  Christian  delegation,  told  an  ABC  Radio  program  on  Wednesday  morning:  “I  think  the   wall  and  some  of  the  restrictions  imposed  on  Palestinians  do  have   that  inhumane  effect   “I  think  if  steps  are  taken  that  then  lead  to  great  frustration  and  feelings  of  being  pressured  and  hemmed  in  and  oppressed  on  the  part  of  another  group  of  people,  that  may  have  the  effect  of  leading   to  more  anger  and  frustration.”   Eli  Yerushalmi,  deputy  chief  of  mission  at  the  Israeli  Embassy  in  Canberra,  said  Archbishop  AspinalTs  comments  were  regret  table,  especially  considering  the  delegation  rejected  Israeli  offers  until  recently  to  visit  Israeli  areas.   As  previously  reported  in  The  AJN,  the  delegation  originally  did  not  plan  to  visit  Israel,  just  the  Palestinian  territories.  After  peti  tioning  by  Jewish  leaders,  the  group,  which  also  included  Catholic,  Baptist  and  Uniting  Church  representatives,  visited  the  Peres  Peace  Centre,  Yad  Vashem  and  met  with  a  press  officer  from   the  Israeli  Government   Yerushalmi  expressed  concerns  that  the  group  had  not  seen  enough   Israeli  areas,  but  had  extensively   toured  the  West  Bank   “Before  the  group  actually  went  to  Israel,  we  offered  to  make  this  visit  a  “fair  visit”  -  basically  to  divide  their  time  between  the  Pales  tinians  and  the  Israelis,”  he  said.   “We  thought  that  as  Christian  leaders  they  needed  to  see  both  sides  of  the  story.”   While  he  did  not  accuse  the   Anglican  Primate  of  being  anti  Israel,  he  did  express  regret  that  Archbishop  Aspinall’s  comments  on  the  radio  appeared  to  be  “pre  empted,  anti-Israeli  bias”.   Yerushalmi  said  the  groups’  views  appeared  to  be  a  “foregone  conclusion  before  they  left”  because  it  had  expressed  no  desire  to  see  the   Israeli  side.   He  said  he  hoped  the  Anglican  Primate’s  sentiments  would  not  be   picked  up  by  the  wider  Christian  community  -  a  community  Yerushalmi  said  understands  the  situation  in  Israel  “very,  very  well”.   “I  think  that  Anglicans  and  other  Christians  around  Australia  understand...  that  Israel  is  fighting  for  survival  in  a  region  that  is  very,  very  difficult  and  complicated,  and   where  some  of  the  countries   around  Israel  actually  say  out  in  the  open  that  they  want  to  erase  it  off   the  face  of  the  earth.”   Yerushalmi  said  that  the  security  fence,  which  was  built  in  2002,  has  significantly  reduced  terrorist   attacks  in  Israel.   “The  wave  of  terror  has  actually  stopped,”  he  said.

"  ABC'S  ‘PASS-OVER’   I  WOULD  like  to  complain  in  the  strongest  possible  terms  about  the  con   tent  of  the  ABC  radio  program,  the  Religion  Report,  of  March  21.  I  was  shocked  by  the  obvious  anti-Zionist  diatribe  from  his  guest,  Lenni  Brenner,  and  more  shocked  by  Crittenden’s  uncritical,  almost  enthusiastic  endorse  ment  of  Brenner’s  extreme  views.   But  even  more  disturbing  than  Crittenden’s  own  bias,  the  issue  that  most  disturbs  me  is  why  a  political  movement,  Zionism  or  anti-Zionism,  was  even  chosen  as  a  suitable  subject  for  the  Religion  Report.   Perhaps  the  presenter  believed  that  Zionism  is  solely  the  prerogative  of  Jews.  If  so,  as  there  are  many  Chris  tian  and  Arab  Zionists,  he  is  woefully  misinformed  and  the  ABC  should  probably  get  a  new  presenter.  If  Crit  tenden  deliberately  used  his  program  on  religion  to  advance  his  own  polit  ical  agenda  then  they  should  defi  nitely  get  a  new  presenter.   It  is  sad  that,  during  the  Easter/Passover  season,  an  opportu  nity  to  educate  Australia  about  the  proud  origins  of  our  Judeo-Christian  culture  and  philosophy  was  “passed  over”  by  Crittenden  in  favour  of  a  sustained  political  attack  on  the  very  legitimacy  of  another  sovereign  state.  What  has  that  to  do  with  religion?  Absolutely  nothing.  Unless  you  are  trying  to  prove  that  anti-Zionism   equals  antisemitism.   ROBBIE  GORE   McKinnon,  Vic ",2007-04-13

"  from  ajn.com.au   The  following  are  some  of  the  best  comments  posted  on  ajn.com.au  over  the  last  week.   ON  JEWISH  ‘DISSIDENTS’   THERE  have  always  been  enough  crit  ics  of  Israel  abroad  without  the  need  for  Jews  to  add  their  voices.   DAVID  DUKES   SELF-HATING  Jew,  traitor,  etc.  are  the  terms  thrown  at  Jews  critical  of  Israeli  government  policies,  by  other  Jews.  (I've  been  on  the  receiving  end  -  even  from  those  I  attended  Sunday  school  with).  Politics  has  overshadowed  reli  gion  -  why  do  so  many  Jews  feel  they  have  to  direct  so  much  hatred  toward  fellow  Jews?  TROPPOCHOOK   IT  is  reassuring  that  some  semblance  of  upholding  pluralism  appears  where  Jews  opposed  to  the  official  policies  of  the  State  of  Israel  are  “not  being  silenced”.  It  falls  flat  however  when  they  are  instead  labelled  with  pejora  tive  terms  like  “Jews  for  genocide”.   NICHOLAS   AS  far  as  I  know,  plenty  of  Israelis  crit  icise  their  own  government's  policies,  and  that  is  seen  as  the  democratic  process.  Perhaps  they  are  closet  anti  semites  too.  KATHERINE   ON  PROFESSOR  ISRAELI   LEBANON  was  a  Christian  country,  “the  Switzerland  of  the  Middle  East”.  As  the  Muslim  population  increased  and  became  assertive,  Christians  left  in  droves.  Christian  emigration  and  Muslim  growth  led  to  a  Muslim  Major  ity  and  a  tribal,  violent  shambles  of  a  country  just  like  the  rest  of  the  Arab  world.

"  TICK  THE  BOX   WHILE  I  accept  the  validity  of  David  Fisher’s  objection  to  answering  the  census  question  on  religious  identifi  cation  (AJN  27/7),  file  moral  argu  ment  for  making  a  statement  of  faith  has,  since  1933,  become  paramount.   Despite  the  accession  to  power  of  Hitler,  via  the  political  processes  of  democratic  Weimar  Germany,  the  western  democracies  have  still  not  learned  the  lesson  and  have  gone  on  since  then  as  if  Nazi  Germany  was  an  unrepeatable  one-off  event.   This  is  so  removed  from  reality  that  Melanie  Phillips  writes:  “British  nationhood  has  been  eviscerated  by  the  combination  of  three  things:  mass  immigration,  multiculturalism  and  the  onslaught  mounted  by  secular  nihilists  against  the  country’s  Judeo   Christian  values.”   Australia  does  not  face  a  threat  of  this  size.  The  prime  minister,  how  ever,  is  well  aware  of  what  is  hap  pening  in  Europe  and  has  emphasised  the  importance  of  our  “core  values”,  the  politically-correct  term  for  “Judaeo-Christian  values”.  These  were   once  shared  by  western  democracies  prior,  that  is,  to  the  farce  of  multicul  turalism,  a  term  that  can  cover  any  thing  from  paedophilia  to  female   circumcision.   The  worldwide  onslaught  on  western  civilisation  -  cunningly  con  cealed  under  camouflage  used  by  left  ists  and  antisemites  that  Muslims  at  war  are  fighting  for  the  Palestinians  and  Iraq  -  is  proceeding  in  every  European  country.  This  quiet  war  has  its  allies  in  the  collapsing  birth  rate  of  the  natives,  the  growing  birth  rate  of  immigrants  and,  as  Canada’s  Mark  Steyn  writes,  men  are  getting  mar  ried,  but  not  women.   The  Europe  we  know  is  dying:  it  is  no  longer  a  question  of  where  it  is  headed,  but  which  country  will  be  first  to  elect  a  government  intent  on  introducing  shari’a  law.  Meanwhile,  I  continue  to  state  my  religion  on  my   census  form.   MARK  BRAHAM   Rose  Bay,  NSW ",2007-08-03
"  QUEERS  (M)  SOLIDARITY   Why  should  I  give  a  fuck  about  gay  nightclubs  in  Singapore?  One  of  the  features  of  queer  life  at  uni  is  a  debate  that  pops  tip  every  now  and  then  over  whether  the  queer  collective  should  do  social'  or  'political'  activities.  The  attraction  of  social  events  is  obvious,  though  it's  not  just  about  picking  up!  They're  a  place  where  you  can  be  yourself  amongst  other  LBGTQ  (lesbian,  bi,  gay,  transgender,  queer)  people  and  not  have  to  defend  or  explain  your  sexuality,  or  where  (for  once)  people  won't  automatically  assume  you're  straight.  When  it  comes  to  political  stuff,  some  people  feel  that  in  their  part  of  Sydney  there  just  isn't  enough  discrimination  to  get  all  worked  up  over.  Others  start  talking  about  the  situation  for  queer  people  in  far-away  places,  or  even  other  oppressions  like  race,  class  and  gender.  It  can  seem  like  'coming  out'  means  you're  suddenly  expected  to  take  on  everyone  else's  cause,  maybe  just  as  you're  getting  over  your  own  issues.  It's  no  more  the  responsibility   queers  than  it  is  anyone  else  to  stand  up  for  the   marginalised  or  the  oppressed,  but  as  human  beings  I  would  argue  that  we  are  called  to  solidarity  with  the  poor  (whether  they  are  poor  economically  or  in  terms  of  their  ability  to  live  freely).  And  my  own  experience  as  a  lesbian  gives  me  a  tiny  bit  of  insight  into  what  that  means,  making  it  harder  to  stand  back  and  do  nothing.  For  example,  I  spent  about  a  year  feeling  confused  and  torn  about  my  identity;  I  can  now  see  echoes  of  that  in  a  friend's  struggle  to  know  what  it  means  to  be  Chinese-Indonesian,  and  to  have  spent  so  long  in  Australia  that  she's  losing  her  Indonesian  language.  Another  -  when  I  used  to  go  to  a  certain  church  I  was  told  it  was  wrong  and  unnatural  to  be  gay;  I  felt  briefly  what  it  meant  to  be  silenced.  When  I  read  about  queer  people  in  Iran  who  lead  a  double  life  to  avoid  potential  arrest,  imprisonment,  flogging  and  even  execution;  or  a  group  of  Christian  Nigerians  who  receive  death  threats  because  they  are  LBGTQ,  or  the  way  the  Singaporean  queer  community  thrives  through  its  nightclub  scene  amidst  a  climate  of  political  oppression,  I  feel  a  sort  of  connection  with  my  fellow  queers  around  the  world.  Of  course  in  many  ways  being  lesbian  tells  me  nothing  at  all   about  others'  lives  and  in  so  many  ways  I  live  a  life  of  privilege.

"  I  !   libel  book  stirs  uproar   PAUL  BOMPARD   ^  ROME  -  A  new  |  book  by  an  emi  I  nent  Italian-Israeli  \  historian  that   |  revives  European  |  blood  libels  has   1  created  such  an   I  I   I   Uproar  in  Italy  and  abroad  that  the  author  has  asked  his  publisher  to  stop  distribution.   Ariel  Toaff  (pictured),  who   teaches  medieval  and  Renaissance   history  at  Bar-Ilan  University  in  Israel,  made  the  request  to  publishers  II  Mulino  of  Bologna  last  week.   The  furore,  as  expected,  didn’t  hurt  sales  of  Bloody  Passover:  Euro  pean  Jews  and  Ritual  Murder.  The  initial  run  of  some  3000  copies  sold  out  so  quickly  after  it  arrived   in  bookstores  earlier  this  month   that  another  edition  was  planned  immediately.   But  Toaff  was  harshly  criticised  in  the  Jewish  world  for  writing  that  Jews  in  the  Middle  Ages  may  have   murdered  Christian  children  to   use  their  blood  in  religious  rituals.   Rabbis,  Jewish  intellectuals  and  community  leaders  expressed  indignation  that  a  reputable  Jewish  historian  should  lend  support  to   scenarios  that  have  been  corner  stones  of  rabid  antisemitism  and   justification  for  the  violent  perse  cution  of  Jews.   “A  Jewish  tradition  of  this  kind  has  never  existed,  nor  has  any  indi   cation  or  custom  that  allows  the  ritual  use  of  human  blood.  The   only  blood  ever  spilt  was  that  of  many  innocent  Jews,  massacred  on  the  basis  of  unjust  and  libellous  accusations,”  a  group  of  Italian  rabbis,  including  Rome’s  chief  rabbi,  Riccardo  Di  Segni,  declared   in  a  statement.   The  issue  is  especially  dis  turbing  for  Italian  Jews  because  of  the  book’s  author.  Toaff  is  the  son  of  Rabbi  Elio  Toaff,  who  from  1951  to  2001  was  chief  rabbi  of  Rome,  Italy’s  largest  Jewish  community.   [“A  Jewish  tradition  of  this   kind  has  never  existed,  nor  has  any  indication  I  or  custom  that  allows   1  the  ritual  use  of  human  |  blood""   ITALIAN  RABBIS   Rabbi  Toaff,  91,  gave  a  press  interview  Wednesday  in  which  he  called  his  son’s  decision  to  suspend  publication  “an  opportune  gesture,  necessary.  It  means  my  son  Ariel   has  understood.  But  it  also  means  that  the  criticism  of  the  book  was   justified.”   Abraham  Foxman,  national  director  of  the  Anti-Defamation   League,  wrote  in  a  statement,  “It  is  incredible  that  anyone,  much  less  an  Israeli  historian,  would  give  legitimacy  to  the  baseless  blood   libel  accusation  that  has  been  the  source  of  much  suffering  and  attacks  against  Jews  historically”   Bloody  Passover  is  based  on  con  fessions,  mostly  extorted  by  tor  ture,  of  Jews  accused  of  ritual  murder.  The  trials  Toaff  examines   took  place  in  Central  Europe  from  1100-1500,  notably  the  1475  trial  in  Trento  -  in  what  is  today  northern  Italy  -  of  13  Jews  of  German  origin.  Under  torture,  they  confessed  to  murdering  and  crucifying  a  Chris   tian  child  on  the  eve  of  Passover.   Of  the  13  -  almost  all  the  adult  males  in  Trento’s  small  Ashkenazi  community  -  11  were  burned  at  the  stake.  The  other  two,  who  had  agreed  to  become  Christians,  were  merely  beheaded.   Toaff’s  thesis  is  that  ritual  mur   ders  of  Christian  children  may  have  been  committed,  and  that  in  the  religiously  passionate  atmos  phere  of  the  Middle  Ages  there   were  small  communities  of  Ashke   nazi  fanatics  -  possibly  deranged  by  persecution,  perhaps  filled  with   hate  for  their  Christian  tormentors   -  who  took  revenge,  veiling  then   actions  with  a  combination  of   superstition  and  religious  ritual.   At  a  time  when  conspiracy  the  ories  about  Jews  are  flourishing,  Foxman  wrote,  “extremist,  antise  mitic  and  Islamic  extremist  groups  will  undoubtedly  use  this  charge  to   further  their  hostile  aims  to  the   Jewish  people.

"  Conviction  a  Victory  for  all  minorities'   MELISSA  SINGER  AND  PETER  KOHN   THE  conviction  of  one  of  the  men   charged  with  attacking  Orthodox   businessman  Menachem  Vorch   heimer  has  been  hailed  as  a  victory  for  all  minority  groups  by  senior  Aus  tralian  Jewish  leaders.   Simon  Phillip  Christian  last  week  pleaded  guilty  and  was  fined  $1000  by  a  Melbourne  magistrate  for  shouting  “Go  Nazis”  at  Sydney-born  Vorch  heimer,  33,  and  his  children  as  they  walked  to  shul  on  October  14,2006.   Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victoria  president  Anton  Block  said  the  conviction  -  the  first  in  Victoria  over  an  antisemitic  incident  and   more  than  15  years  since  the  last  one  in  NSW  -  “is  a  big  step,  not  only  for  the  Jewish  community  but  for  all  minority  groups”.   Two  other  men,  James  Dalton  and  Matthew  Cuthbert,  are  due  to  face  court  in  June  to  answer  a  series  of  charges,  including  theft  and  assault.   Block,  who  was  in  court  last   Wednesday  when  Magistrate  Barbara   Cotterell  handed  down  the  historic  conviction,  praised  the  judicial  com  munity  for  taking  a  tough  stance  on   the  issue.   “I  think  the  community  can  take  comfort  in  the  fact  that  the  judiciary,  represented  by  this  magistrate’s  com  ments  ...  were  unwavering  ...  that  what  [Christian]  said  and  what  he  did  was  unacceptable...  in  a  multicultural  society  like  Australia.”   CONTINUED  ON  NEWS  3   Conviction  a  Victory   for  all  minorities’   CONTINUED  FROM  NEWS  1   In  sentencing,  Magistrate  Cotterell  said  the  21-year-old  Ocean  Grove  footballer’s  comments  were   “extremely  racist”  and  inexcusable,  despite  the  effects  of  alcohol  playing  a  part  in  Christian’s  conduct.   Australia/Israel  8c  Jewish  Affairs  Council  community  affairs  director  Jeremy  Jones  said  last  week’s  convic  tion  was  a  double  victory  over  “anti  semitic  and  cowardly”  attacks,  which  he  has  been  logging  for  the  Jewish  community  since  1989.   Following  the  verbal  abuse,  Vorchheimer  approached  the  bus  carrying  the  footballers  for  an  apology,  but  instead  he  allegedly  had  his  hat  and  kippa  stolen  and  was   struck  across  the  face.   It  was  later  revealed  that  an  off   duty  police  officer,  Senior  Constable  Terry  Moore,  was  driving  the  bus  at  the  time  of  the  alleged  attack.  Earlier  this  month,  the  police  force’s  Office  of  Police  Integrity  found  that  Moore  “could  have  prevented”  the  incident.  His  conduct  is  still  being  reviewed  by  Victoria  Police’s  Ethical  Stan  dards  Department  and  is  also  the  subject  of  a  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunity  Commission  hearing,  which  was  adjourned  on  April  16.   In  an  in-depth  interview,  Vorch  heimer  told  the  AJN  he  has  pursued   his  attackers  so  vigorously  to  obtain  a   conviction  that  will  benefit  both  the   Jewish  and  general  communities.   “The  conviction  and  sentence  were  never  about  the  $1000,  but  about  effecting  a  change  in  the  atti  tude  that  people  can  treat  someone  badly  because  they  look  different,”   Vorchheimer  said.   Manny  Waks,  executive  officer  of  B’nai  B’rith’s  Anti-Defamation  Commission,  praised  the  decision  last  week,  but  lamented  the  length  of  the  investigation.   “In  future  we  hope  that  Victoria  Police  is  able  to  deal  with  similar  issues  in  a  more  expedited  manner,”  Waks  said  in  a  statement.   But  Grahame  Leonard,  president   of  the  Executive  Council  of  Aus   tralian  Jewry,  said  the  community  “showed  impatience  about  how  long  it  took  to  deal  with  this  matter  but  we  have  to  be  fair  ...  the  justice  system  has  to  go  through  its  proper  processes”.   Caulfield  MP  Helen  Shardey,   who  twice  raised  the  matter  in  State  Parliament,  hopes  the  conviction  “will  become  a  lesson  for  anyone  else  who  thinks  it’s  okay  to  racially  abuse  people”.

"  Who  is  a  Jew?   KALEIDOSCOPE   JULIE  SZEGO   Cardinal  Jean-Marie  Lustiger,  who  died  earlier  this  month,  always  considered  himself   Jewish,  much  to  the  disgust  of  many  Jews.  Perhaps  he  had  a  point.   ILustiger  advocated  for  a   range  of  Jewish  and   Zionist  causes,  but  for  many  Jews  this  meant   little.  He  was  a  heretic,  a  traitor,  pure  and  simple.   ONCE  asked  a  friend  with  a   vaguely  Jewish-sounding  sur  name  about  his  religious  and  cul  tural  background.  “I’m  an   Anglican  Jew,”  he  replied;  Jewish  by  ancestry  and  tribal  affiliation,  Christ  ian  by  faith.  I  nodded  my  under  standing  and  moved  on  to  the  next  topic.  But  some  others  in  our  group  who  witnessed  this  exchange  stam  mered  in  confusion.  “What  do  you  mean  you’re  an  Anglican  Jew?”  one   asked.   I’ve  got  a  hunch  that  many  of  you  are  dividing  into  roughly  two  camps.  Those  in  the  first  camp  don’t  auto  matically  dismiss  the  idea  of  a  Christ  ian  Jew  -  or  any  other  variety  of  spiritually-comprised  Jew  -  as  an  oxymoron.  Those  in  the  second  camp  do  so  dismiss  it.  How  can  you  remain  a  member  of  a  fiercely  monotheistic  religion  if  you  subscribe  to  a  theolog  ical  order  that  contradicts  its  very  essence,  they  might  argue?   I  revisited  these  issues  when  read   ing  of  the  death  this  month  of  Cardi  nal  Jean-Marie  Lustiger,  whose  life  was  a  philosophical  storm.   Lustiger,  born  to  Polish  Jewish  parents,  converted  to  Catholicism  at  the  age  of  14  and  rose  through  the  ranks  of  the  Vatican  hierarchy.  But  it  wasn’t  this  fact  alone  that  inspired  so  much  angst.  The  problem  was  that  Cardinal  Lustiger,  whose  mother  per  ished  at  Auschwitz,  never  renounced  his  Jewishness.  He  called  himself  a  “fulfilled  Jew”,  who  discerned  a  conti  nuity  between  the  Old  and  New  Tes   taments.  He  told  Elie  Wiesel:  “I  feel  Jewish.  I  refuse  to  renounce  my  roots,  my  Jewishness.  How  could  I  betray  my  mother’s  memory?  It  would  be  cowardly  and  humiliating.”   Lustiger  advocated  for  a  range  of  Jewish  and  Zionist  causes,  but  for  many  Jews  this  meant  little.  He  was  a  heretic,  a  traitor,  pure  and  simple.  When  in  1995  Lustiger  was  invited  to   address  a  Holocaust  conference  in  Israel,  Chief  Rabbi  Yisrael  Meir  Lau  vilified  him  as  betraying  his  people  and  his  religion.   The  rabbi’s  words  imply  the  Jewish  people  and  the  Jewish  religion  are  one  and  the  same.  It’s  an  appealing  propo  sition,  but  manifestly  false.   History  proves  it  false  and  theol  ogy  (in  which  I’m  admittedly  far  from  expert)  gives  little  comfort.  If  you  are  born  to  a  Jewish  mother  you  are  a  Jew,  period.  There’s  no  opt-out  clause,  as  I  understand  it,  no  matter  how  grave  a  Jew’s  betrayal.   For  Jew-haters  there’s  also  no  opt  out  clause,  and  for  me  this  is  the  clincher.  Hitler  wasn’t  swayed  one  bit  by  the  Jewish  Christ-lovers;  they  would  burn  alongside  Judaism’s  most  faithful.  I  remember  being  disturbed  and  a  little  shamed  by  the  response  of  our  community  leaders  when  some   thugs  carried  out  a  clearly  antisemitic  attack  on  the  Caulfield  premises  of  Jews  for  Jesus.  The  communal  repre  sentative  basically  said  the  attacks  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  Jewish  community;  they  just  weren’t  our  problem.   Now  hear  me  properly,  please.  Jews  for  Jesus  is  a  sinister  and  manip  ulative  cult:  no  question.  And  yet,  the  small-time  Neo-Nazis  who  targeted  the  group  saw  only  the  word  “Jews”  and  considered  it  enough.  They  weren’t  interested  in  theology  nuance;  they  wanted  to  go  after  Jews  and  this  they  did.  Shouldn’t  a  Jewish  commu  nity  representative  have  at  least  acknowledged  the  attackers  were  motivated  by  antisemitism?  Is  it  a  case  of.  “First  they  came  for  the  (Christ  ian)  Jews?”   Lustiger  might  have  betrayed  his  religion  -  a  decision  I  will  never   understand  or  endorse.  But  he  never   wished  to  betray  his  people.  He  took  the  hard  road,  grappling  with  the  tough  questions  about  the  Church’s  past  crimes  against  Jews,  baiting  the   antisemite  Catholics  to  come  get  him.  He  didn’t  have  to  do  any  of  this;  he  could  have  convinced  himself  of  the   possibility  of  escape.  Being  a  man  of  moral  fortitude,  he  did  no  such  thing.   What  am  I  trying  to  say  here?  Not  a  whole  lot  more  than  this:  to  be  Jew  ish  is  to  be  part  of  something  complex,  mysterious,  almost  unfathomable.  The  Jews  are  a  religion,  but  they’re  not  just  a  religion  and  sometimes  they’re  not  a  religion  at  all.  The  Chris  tian  Jews,  Hindu  Jews,  Buddhist  Jews,  Muslim  Jews,  you-name-it  Jews  are  part  of  the  extended  Jewish  family,   whether  we  like  it  or  not.   Among  the  myriad  tragedies  that  accompanied  the  Jews’  march  through  history  is  one  we  bring  on  ourselves.  The  inner  circle  of  Jews,  in  defence  of  religious  purity,  cast  out  those  on  the  fringes  as  if  it’s  really   their  call.  It  never  has  been  and  never  will  be.  Others  know  “who  is  a  Jew”  even  if  we  don’t.  They  know.   Julie  Szego  is  a  writer  for  The  Age.  Her   column  appears  monthly. ",2007-08-31
"  RUDD  BETTERFORTHEJEWS   MANY  Jewish  people  are  saying  that  only  the  Liberal  Party  is  good  for  the  Jews  and  Israel,  and  therefore  we  should  all  vote  Liberal.  This  is  incor  rect  and  foolish.   Fortunately,  both  sides  of  parlia  ment  have  a  long  track  record  of  sup  porting  Israel,  since  the  United  Nations  vote  on  partition.  Many  Labor  leaders,  including  Rudd,  have  visited  Israel  and  have  voiced  their  support  publicly.   Jews  should  be  aware  that  there  are  antisemites  on  the  extreme  right  as  well  as  the  extreme  left  of  politics.  “Pastor  Danny  Nalliah,  the  head  of  the   Melbourne-based  Catch  the  Fire  Min  istries,  has  confirmed  that  he  addressed  the  far  right-wing  League  of  Rights,  despite  being  warned  that  they  were  anti-Jewish”  (The  Age,  31/10/07).   Nalliah  is  a  minister  who  has  the  ear  of  both  Howard  and  Costello,  and  has  led  a  prayer  meeting  in  Parliament   House.  Nalliah  “told  followers  that  he  held  one-on-one  meetings  with  Mr  Costello  on  August  9  and  Mr  Howard  on  August  10.”   Nalliah  also  attacked  Kevin  Rudd   on  the  grounds  that  he  was  insuffi  ciently  Christian,  because  “he  failed  to  confirm  that  Jesus  was  the  son  of  God  when  asked  on  SBS  last  month”.   In  refusing  to  state  his  personal  reli  gious  convictions  so  publicly,  Kevin  Rudd  shows  respect  for  all  of  the  non  Christians  in  Australian  society  and  refuses  to  make  religion  an  election  issue.  He  clearly  believes  in  the  separa  tion  of  state  and  church,  which  is  aus  tralian  constitutional  law,  and  one  of  the  bedrock  values  of  our  society.   One  of  Howard’s  prot£g£s,  Tony  Abbot,  has  claimed  that  “Labor  MPs  did  not  have  the  same  Christian  com  mitment  as  those  from  the  Coalition”.  The  religiosity  of  candidates  is  a  new  element  in  the  Australian  political  scene,  and  has  been  introduced  solely  by  the  Coalition.   Howard  has  taken  us  down  the   American  path  to  Iraq,  to  flagrant  breaches  of  human  and  civil  rights,  and  now  to  a  blurring  of  the  lines   between  church  and  state.

"  Inter-faith  pioneer  cool  on  Judas  book   PETER  KOHN   INTER-FAITH  pioneer  Rabbi  John  Levi  is  sceptical  about  the  impact  a  book  on  the  New  Testament  figure  of  Judas  is  likely  to  have  on  Christ  ian  attitudes  toward  Jews.   The  Gospel  According  To  Judas,  by  Benjamin  Iscariot,  which  was  released  globally  last  week,  is  a  col  laboration  between  acclaimed  Mel  bourne  Catholic  biblical  scholar  Professor  Francis  Moloney  and  high-profile  British  author  Lord  Jef  frey  Archer.   As  Professor  Moloney  told  the  AJN,  it  offers  a  “possible”  narrative  of  Judas  that  sees  him  as  a  tragic  fig  ure  trying  to  rescue  Jesus  from  death,  rather  than  as  his  betrayer.   But  Levi,  emeritus  rabbi  of  Mel  bourne’s  Temple  Beth  Israel  and  a  co-founder  of  the  Council  of  Chris  tians  and  Jews  (CCJ),  said  it  is  important  to  remember  that  the  story  of  Judas  is  a  theological  “midrash”  written  for  the  gospels   and  not  a  historical  narrative.   He  said  the  Judas  story  was  con  fected  in  the  years  following  the  destruction  of  the  Second  Temple,  decades  after  it  was  meant  to  have  happened,  and  as  an  added  justifica  tion  to  fuel  anti-Jewish  animosity.   Rabbi  John  Levi...  sceptical  about  the  Impact  a  book  on  the  New  Testament  figure  of  Judas  Is  likely  to  have  on  Christian  attitudes  to  Jews.   “People  who  look  at  the  New  Testament  rationally  don’t  base  their  beliefs  on  it,”  he  said,  adding  that  he  doubts  the  Vatican  will  react  to  it  in  a  high-profile  way.  “The  Vatican  are  not  literalists  and  don’t  base  their  positions  on  an  interpretation  of  a  story  that  doesn’t  really  work.”   But  he  said  he  welcomes  the  new  book  as  the  subject  matter  for  “an  interesting  lecture”.   Rabbi  Levi  said  he  has  not  yet  read  the  Moloney-Archer  novella.   Raymond  Apple,  emeritus  rabbi  of  Sydney’s  Great  Synagogue  and  a  pioneer  of  the  CCJ,  told  the  AJN  from  Israel  that  he  had  not  yet  read  the  book  and  would  not  comment.

"  Australian  scholar  helps  shed  new  light  on  Judas   PETER  KOHN   A  LANDMARK  book  that   was  co-authored  by  an  Aus  tralian  scholar  may  cause  the  Catholic  Church  to  reap  praise  Judas  Iscariot  -  the  New  Testament  figure  at  the  core  of  theological  tensions  between  Christianity  and   Judaism  -  as  a  man  of  com  passion  rather  than  the  betrayer  of  Jesus.   Melbourne  Catholic  priest  and  theologian  Professor  Francis  Moloney  joined  forces  with  British  celebrity  author  Lord  Jeffrey  Archer  to  write  The  Gospel  According  to  Judas,  by  Benjamin  Iscariot,   which  was  launched  in  Rome  this  week.   Professor  Moloney  told  the  AJN  there  is  a  chance  the  Vat  ican  could  issue  a  formal   ♦   reappraisal  of  Judas  in  light  of   the  book.   The  101-page  novella  is  written  in  the  style  of  a  New  Testament  Gospel  and  is  based  on  Judas’  account  of  his  role  in  the  crucifixion,  as  told  to  his  son  Benjamin.   Given  the  significance  of  the  Judas  narrative  to  nearly  2000  years  of  Jewish  persecu  tion  by  the  Church,  the  book  could  herald  a  new  era  of   Christian  understanding  for  Jews,  Professor  Moloney  said.   But  Professor  Moloney,  who  heads  Australia’s  Salesian  Order,  said  the  book  could  cause  fireworks  in  the  Catholic   Church  because  it  rejects  aspects  of  the  Gospels,  partic  ularly  Matthew,  in  which  Judas  is  accused  of  betraying  Jesus  for  30  pieces  of  silver.   The  Gospel  According  to  Judas  saw  the  unlikely  pairing  of  Professor  Moloney,  a  distin  guished  Catholic  theologian  with  close  links  to  Pope  Bene  dict  XVI,  and  Lord  Archer,  who  served  two  years’jail  after  being  found  guilty  of  perjury   in  2001.   Before  flying  to  Rome  for  Macmillan’s  global  launch  of  the  book,  Professor  Moloney,  67,  told  the  AJN:  “It  was  a  pro  found  collaboration  between  a  Christian  scholar  well  versed  in  the  Gospels,  and  a  story  teller.  It’s  a  strange  combina  tion,  but  it  works.  It’s  been  a  tough  job,  doing  the  work  and  also  controlling  Jeffrey   Archer.” ",2007-03-23
"  Community   Connecting  through   commonalities   TALIAKA77   TEACHING  children  about  our  similarities  and  not  our  differences  is  the  key  to  con  necting  different  religious  groups.  This  is  the  message  that  Rabbi  Zalman  Kastel  of  the  Together  for  Humanity  foundation  is  sending   to  schools  across  Australia.   Rabbi  Kastel,  the  national  director  of  the  organisation,  visited  St  Ives  North  Primary  School  recently,  which  is  just  one  of  the  many  schools  involved  in  the  program.   “We  use  fun,  which  is  important  on  an  emotional  level,”  Kastel  explains.  “In  a  75  minute  class,  you  can  see  [the  students]  taking  a  step  back  from  being  hostile,  to  becoming  comfortable  and  friendly.”   Since  the  foundation’s  inception  in  2002,  Jewish,  Muslim,  Christian  and  indigenous  presenters  have  visited  primary  and  high  schools  to  challenge  stereotypes  and  assumptions  about  different  cultures.

"  Rabbi:  challenges  ahead  for  peoples  of  the  book   MV  STAFF   WHILE  there  is  much  to  celebrate  about  relations  between  the  Abra  hamic  faiths  in  Australia,  there  are  great  challenges  ahead,  a  Chabad  rabbi  said  in  Sydney  this  week.   “The  joy  we  can  feel  about  our  achievements  must  be  tempered   with  awe  at  the  vastness  of  the  task  in  front  of  us,”  Rabbi  Zalman  Kas  tel,  national  director  of  the  Together  for  Humanity  Founda   tion  inter-faith  group,  told  Sun  days  sixth  annual  Abraham  Con  ference  at  the  University  of  Sydney.   “There  are  many  who  are  aligned  to  our  faiths  who  are  cer  tainly  not  growing  together  yet.  Many,  in  fact,  are  growing  apart  in  fear,  anger,  in  hate,  and  contempt,”  said  Rabbi  Kastel,  who  is  also  the  youth  rabbi  of  Chabad  of  the   North  Shore.   “Many  who  have  begun  the  journey,  myself  included,  have  a   Emanuel  School  students  Sam   Ozana  and  Emily  Nathan  with   Muslim  student   Hatlce  Derell  from  Sule  College  at  the  Youth  Encounters  function.

Rabbi  Kastel  spoke  of  two  major  tasks  in  bringing  faiths  together:  each  faith  community   needs  to  “divert  the  resources  from  other  priorities  to  create  and  sus  tain  effective,  creative  and  mean  ingful  responses”.   Offering  his  own  experience  as  an  example,  Rabbi  Kastel  said  his  involvement  with  inter-faith  work  transformed  him  “from  my  rela  tively  insular  upbringing  in  New  York  where  all  the  people  I  knew,  liked  and  respected  were  Jewish”.   “I  would  never  have  imagined  spending  a  week  in  Darwin,  work  ing  and  eating  breakfast  and  din  ner  together  with  a  Muslim  religious  leader  who  happened  to  be  an  Arab,  along  with  two  women,  one  Christian  and  the  other  Aboriginal.”   He  said  growing  together  requires  “courage  to  reflect  on  our  selves,  our  own  communities  and  even  in  our  sacred  texts.   “I  am  not  familiar  with  all  the  texts  but,  based  on  what  little  I  know,  I  think  I  say  confidently  that  there  are  passages  in  many  tradi  tions  that,  taken  at  face  value,  are  not  consistent  with  absolute   mutual  acceptance,  respect  for   each  other  and  each  other’s  beliefs   and  complete  empathy.”   The  conference’s  organisers  include  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  the  Muslim-based  Affin  ity  Intercultural  Foundation,  the   Columbian  Centre  for  Christian   Muslim  Relations,  the  Uniting  Church  and  the  Sydney  Catholic   Archdiocese.

"  mpact  of  church  politics  on  Israel   Book  review   CROSS  ON  THE  STAR  OF  DAVID   Uri  Blaler   Indiana  University  Press,  $48   Reviewed  by  Joff  Lelllott   NTIL  recently,  there  were  no  books  on  Israel  and  the  churches  in  the  period  v—/after  independence.  This  is  remark  able  given  how  obvious  it  is  that  the  churches  were  involved  in  a  range  of  issues  during  Israel’s  formative  years.   This  omission  has  now  been  rectified  by  Uri  Bialer,  professor  of  international  rela  tions  at  Hebrew  University  (and  recently  at  Monash  University  in  Melbourne  for  sev  eral  months).   ...  His  book,  primarily  dealing  with  diplo  matic  history,  is  in  two  parts.  The  first  deals  with  Israeli-Vatican  relations;  the  second,  with  a  collection  of  issues  including  Arab  and  other  Christian  communities  in  Israel,   missionary  work,  Church  property  and  the  special  status  of  French  institutions.   Bialer’s  book  is  accessible  and  captures  the  nuance  of  debates  and  actions  well.  Assertions  are  thoroughly  documented  with  extensive  quotes  from  primary  sources,  including  recently  declassified  government  archives  -  many  used  for  the  first  time.  Bialer  is  even-handed  and  not  afraid  of  criti  cising  Israel.   •  Part  way  through,  he  succinctly  sums  up  the  Israeli  view.  For  Israel,  the  Catholic  Church  represented  an  external  threat,  by  its  manoeuvring  over  recognising  Israel  and  influence  on  Catholic  countries.  By  contrast,  Protestant  institutions  were  broadly  sup  portive  of  Israel,  but  were  an  internal  threat  because  of  their  missionary  work  -  even  though  in  reality,  missionaries  had  little  impact  on  the  Jewish  population.   Long  before  1948,  Israeli  leaders  realised  the  churches,  particularly  the  Vatican,  were  critical  to  winning  support  for  Israel,  espe  cially  from  France,  Italy  and  Latin  America.  So  Israeli  leaders  sought  to  win  over  the  Vatican,  or  at  least  reach  an  accommodation  with  it.  In  the  postwar  world,  however,  the   Vatican  saw  itself  as  leader  in  a  new  war  to  contain  communism.  Unfortunately,  like  many  others,  it  was  concerned  Israel  could  join  the  communist  bloc.   For  the  Vatican,  control  of  Christian  holy  places,  including  the  whole  of  Jerusalem,  was  a  critical  weapon  in  this  new  struggle.  A  UN  resolution  backed  the  Vatican  position,  calling  for  an  independently-administered  Jerusalem  with  guaranteed  free  access  to  all  holy  places.  To  Israel  this  would  undermine  the  new  state’s  sovereignty  and  open  other  complex  issues.   This  background  sets  the  scene  for  the  section  on  the  Vatican,  which  gives  a  detailed  description  of  a  turbulent  relationship.   The  second  half  of  the  book  is  packed  with  equally  fascinating  events  on  a  range  of  subjects  -  especially  interesting  is  the  fate  of  church  schools.  Bialer  sometimes  offers  more  detail  than  many  readers  will  want,  but  his  intended  audience  is  primarily  other   academics.

He's  obviously  done  major  research  here,  but  I  suspect  the  genetic  engineering  may  be  a  tad  more  difficult  than  portrayed.  D'Hage's  theological  studies  and  foray  into  the  West's,  and  in  particular  the  US's  stance  on  the  Middle  East,  give  us  the  main  thrust  of  this  novel  -  US  Christian  bigotry  and  the  West's  refusal  to  reconcile  cultural  dissonance  with  the  Islamic  world.

"  Islamo-facism  ‘worse  than  Hitler’,  says  commentator   PETER  KOHN   LEBANESE-BORN,  American-based  broadcaster  and  commentator  Brigitte  Gabriel  is  coming  to  Australia  next  month  with  a  warning.   Her  worldwide  message  is  that  western  countries  need  to  be  vigilant  about  preserving  the  democratic,  plu  ralistic  values  of  open  societies.   Gabriel,  formerly  a  member  of  Lebanon’s  Christian  community,  does  not  pull  her  punches.   Asked  about  how  Australia  should   respond  to  radical  local  Islamists  sup  porting  terrorist  organisations,  she  said  such  community  leaders  “should  be  expelled  or  placed  in  isolation  so  they  can’t  infect  others  with  their  hate”.   “I’m  sure  most  Australians,  most  Americans  and  British,  will  do  what  ever  they  can  to  stop  the  poisoning  of  young,  impressionable  minds,”  she  told  the  AJN  from  Washington  DC.   Gabriel  is  coming  to  Australia  as  a  guest  of  the  lewish  National  Fund  (JNF).  She  will  speak  at  a  Negev  Now  gala  dinner  in  Melbourne  on  May  20,  when  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  is  scheduled  to  receive  one  of  the  JNF’s  highest  honours  -  a  forest  in  his  name   in  Israel.   She  said  her  first-hand  experience  with  intolerance  and  war  fires  her  pas  sionate  campaign  to  speak  up  for  democracy  and  the  values  of  open  societies.  Her  best-selling  2006  book,  Why  They  Hate,  analyses  radical  Islamist  thinking.  It  was  written  “as  a  warning  to  the  West,  specifically  to   America.  As  a  survivor  of  war  in   “Islamo-fascism  is  a  greater  threat  even  than  Nazism.  A  nuclear  bomb  can  do  in  seconds  what  it  took  Hitler  years  to  accomplish”   BRIGITTE  GABRIEL  Lebanese-born  commentator   Lebanon,  I  know  the  price  of  war.”   Gabriel  was  11  when  Israel  invaded  Lebanon  in  1982  to  drive  out  the  Palestinian  Liberation  Organisation.  When  her  mother  was  wounded  by  Palestinian  gunfire,  she  took  the  courageous  step  of  crossing  the  border  to  take  her  to  an  Israeli  hospital.   She  was  surprised  at  how  diametri  cally  opposite  Israelis  were  to  the  “bar  baric”  image  presented  in  the  Lebanese   media.   “For  my  mother,  it  was  a  lifesaving  experience;  for  me,  it  was  a  life  changing  experience,”  she  recalled.   She  settled  in  Israel,  where  she  became  a  broadcaster  on  World  News.  In  1985,  she  moved  to  the  US,  where  she  later  took  up  citizenship.  She  has   worked  for  German  TV  in  Gaza  and  the  West  Bank  and  for  Middle  East  Television,  a  company  owned  by  US   Reverend  Pat  Robertson’s  Christian  Broadcasting  Network.   Gabriel  is  now  based  in  Washing  ton  and  heads  the  American  Congress  for  Truth,  an  organisation  she  founded  after  the  September  11  attacks  to  raise  public  consciousness  about  the  dan  gers  of  Islamist  radicalism.   “Islamo-fascism  is  a  greater  threat   even  than  Nazism.  A  nuclear  bomb  can  do  in  seconds  what  it  took  Hitler  years  to  accomplish,”  she  said.   JNFs  Negev  Now  campaign  aims  to  increase  the  population  in  Israel’s  Negev  region  by  creating  more  infra  structure,  including  the  construction  of  two  water-treatment  plants.

"  Bamaga  Cadets  earn  promotion   Eight  cadets  from  the  146  ACU  (Army  Cadet  Unit)  from  the  NPA  College  at  Bamaga  have  been  promoted  in  rank  following  a  week-long  promotion  course  at  Charters  Towers.  Five  have  been  promoted  from  Cadets  to  Corporal  and  three  from  Corporal  to  Sergeant.  Officer-in-Charge  Lieutenant  Margaret  Cowley  said  she  was  thrilled  that  all  had  been  promoted.  ""I  am  so  proud  of  them  to  get  where  they  are.  The  course  is  very  hard  and  the  language  is  only  the  second  or  third  language   to  them  as  well  there  was  a  great  deal  ol'Arriiy  jargon  they  are  not  familiar  with.  The  cadets  also  had  to  teach  lessons  and  were  assessed  on  their  presentations;  this  was  really  challenging  for  them.""   About  260  cadets  from  throughout  Queensland  and  60  staff  took  part  in  the  course  which  had  been  held  at  Abergowrie  College  for  the  three  previous  years.  This  year's  course  at  St  Gabriel's  All  Souls  School  in  Charters  Towers  covered  navigation,  fieldcraft,  drills,  field  signals,  leadership  and  verbal  orders.  Together  with  the  promotion  course,  Sonia  Townson  has  been  promoted  to  Second  Lieutenant  during  the  OIC  promotion  course,  and  will  be  Second-in-Charge  tothe  Officer-in-Charge.  Lt  Cowley,  who  co-ordinating  the  programme  at  the  College  for  four  years,  says  the  programme  has  been  operating  for  the  last  seven  years,  and  is  Ml  of  praise  for  ""This  programme  has  been  veiy  good  for  the  communities,  and  has  brought  out  good  discipline  for  children  who  have  had  high  truancy  rates  and  behavioural  problems.  ""To  join  they  have  to  show  good  attendance,  good  behaviour  and  good  academic  levels.  It  has  changed  a  lot  of  kids  who  previously  had  high  truancy.""  The  eight  promoted  will  be  presented  with  their  certificates  at  the  Bamaga  Anzac  Day  Ceremony  in  2007.  Three  cadets  were  presented  this  year.  ""The  presentation  ceremony  is  a  highlight  within  the  community  to  see  our  cadets  in  full  dress  uniform.  This  shows  how  the  parents  and  the  community  can  woik  together  with  the  ACU.""  Lt  Cowley  paid  special  thanks  to  Charlie  Company  for  their  support,  especially  Major  Andrew  Marsh  for  accommodating  the  group  on  their  way  to  and  from  the  course;  CSM  Greaves  for  his  time  and  support  for  the  unit  in  Bamaga;  and  the  ACU  in  Canberra  for  finding  the  unit  to  attend  courses.  Lt  Cowley  says  the  ACU  is  increasing  a  career  path  for  the  cadets  to  join  the  Australian  Defence  Force.  ""And  a  lot  of  cadets  are  now  looking  into  that  path.""

"  BEYOND  COMPREHENSION   IN  the  mid-19th  century,  a  massive  immigration  of  Galician  Jews  settled  in  Romania,  triggering  a  vicious  antisemitic  reaction  spearheaded  by  the  Romanian  cultural  cum  political   elite.   They  were  comparing  the  much  older,  and  considerably  smaller,  established  Jewish  Bucharest  com  munity  with  what  they  were  terming,  among  other  many  vicious  epithets,  the  “gutter  rabbis  in  their  black  caftans  with  throngs  of  chil  dren  in  tow”.  They  were  also  calling  for  the  expulsion  of  the  unintegrated  Jews  who,  among  other  deficiencies,  could  not  understand  and  appreciate  the  “generous  and  peace-loving   nature  of  their  Christian   neighbours”.   The  contribution  of  Mark  Baker  (AJN  12/7)  is,  to  a  large  degree,  an  identically  revolting  stance  reflecting  the  inability  of  self-proclaimed  arbiters  of  ethics  and  decency  to  understand  the  essence  of  Jewish  dignity.  It  is  beyond  one’s  compre   hension  why  a  Jewish  publication  will  allow  such  offensive  opinions  to  sully  its  pages.   OTTO  WALDMANN  Bellevue  Hill,  NSW ",2007-07-20
"  NO  ANSWERS  FOR  ASSAULT  VICTIM   MELBOURNE  -  Hie  off-duty  policeman  who  was  driving  a  busload  of  Australian  Rules  footballers  when  they  allegedly   made  antisemitic  remarks  towards  Mel  bourne  man  Menachem  Vorchheimer  has  escaped  reprimand  in  Victorian  parliament.   Victorian  Opposition  Leader  Ted  Baillieu  asked  on  Tuesday  why  no  action  has  been  taken  against  the  officer,  despite  recommendations  that  stemmed  from  the  Office  of  Police  Integrity  report  on  the  incident.   Baillieu’s  question  was  dismissed  on  a  point  of  order,  with  Victorian  Pre  mier  John  Brumby  stating  that  it  is  a  matter  for  police  command,  not  the  government.   The  silence  following  Baillieu's  ques  tion  is  another  blow  to  Vorchheimer,  who  after  10  months  is  still  waiting  for  the  Melbourne  Magistrates’  Court  to  hear  the  cases  of  two  of  the  alleged  perpetrators.  The  third,  Simon  Phillip  Christian,  was  fined  $1000  in  April  for  shouting,  “Go  Nazis”,  at  Vorchheimer  and  his  children  in  October  2006.

"  ECAJ  blasts  Christian  leaders  on  Israel  statement   THE  Executive  Council  of  Aus   tralian  Jewry  (ECAj)  has  crit  icised  Aus  t  r  a  1  i  a  ’  s  Christian  leaders  for  releasing  a   statement  on   Robert  Goot   Israel  that  “may  be  motivated  by  good  intentions  but...  manifests  a  serious  lack  of  balance  and  misrepresents  what  is  required  to  achieve  peace”.   Some  of  the  country’s  most  influ  ential  Christian,  leaders  including  head  of  the  Anglican  Church  Arch  bishop  Phillip  Aspinall  and  Tim  Costello,  chief  executive  of  World  Vision  Australia,  launched  the  state  ment  in  Canberra  on  Wednesday.   “It’s  time  for  the  Australian  Gov  ernment  to  shift  gear  on  Palestine  and  Israel,”  the  Head  of  Churches  state  ment  said.  “It’s  time  for  Australia  to  become  much  more  active  in  the  cause  of  peace  in  the  Holy  Land.”   The  statement  made  a  number  of  requests  of  the  Rudd  Government,  including  increased  advocacy  for  a  “freely  and  peacefully  negotiated  solution  acceptable  to  both  Israelis  and  Palestinians,  whether  in  the  form  of  two  states  or  one”.   Robert  Goot,  president  of  the  ECAJ,  slammed  this  request,  saying   that  the  majority  of  observers  under  stand  that  a  “one-state  solution”  would  mean  the  destruction  of  the  Jewish  State.   “International  inquiries  into  the  conflict  since  1937,  landmark  resolu  tions  of  the  UN  since  1947,  signed  agreements  between  Israel  and  the  PLO,  and  statements  issues  by  the  Quartet  -  comprising  the  UN,  the  European  Union,  Russia  and  the  United  States  -  have  accepted  that  two  states  for  two  peoples  is  the  only  just  and  achievable  solution,”  Goot  said.   The  Head  of  Churches  statement  also  asked  the  Australian   Government  to  give   “greater  recognition”   to  the  Palestinians  after  41  years  of   military  occupation.   ■  ROBERT  GOOT   President  of  the  ECAJ   The  Head  of  Churches  statement  also  asked  the  Australian  Government  to  give  “greater  recognition”  to  the  Palestinians  “after  41  years  of  military  occupation”  and  for  four-times  more  aid  to  be  contributed  to  the  “social  and   economic  development  of  Palestine”   •  Goot  added:  “While  there  is   undoubtedly  suffering  on  both  sides,  the  statement  is  conspicuously  silent  on  the  openly  expressed  ambitions  of  Hamas,  Hezbollah,  and  their  sponsor  Iran,  to  eliminate  Israel  and  drive  out  or  exterminate  its  Jewish  population.”   The  ECAJ  president  was  also  sur  prised  that  church  leaders  failed  to  acknowledge  Israel’s  role  in  pro  tecting  all  faiths  and  holy  sites  within   its  borders.   The  Head  of  Churches  statement  was  released  to  coincide  with  the  World  Council  of  Churches  (WCC)  international  week  of  church  action  for  peace  in  Palestine  and  Israel.   This  week,  the  WCC  released  a  message  to  its  constituency  that  focused  strongly  on  the  Palestinians,  but  neglected  to  mention  the  plight  of   the  Israelis.   “It’s  time  to  end  60  years  of  conflict,  oppression  and  fear.  It’s  time  for  freedom  from  occupation,”  the  message  read.   The  Head  of  Churches  is  an  organisation  of  Christian  churches  around  Australia  affiliated  with  the   WCC.  While  the  heads  of  larger  churches  signed,  others,  including  the  Salvation  Army,  Chinese  Methodist  Church  of  Australia  and  the  Coptic  Orthodox  Church,  did  not  sign  the   statement  on  Israel.

"  Christian  Zionists  here  and  abroad  are  professing  their  love  for  Israel.  But  why?   COUNTERPUNCH   DVIR  ABRAMOVICH   LET’S  start  with  a  question.   Who  said  the  following:   “Israel  has  no  better  friends  in  the  world  than  Christian  Zionists.  This  is  a  friendship  of  the  heart,  a  friendship  of  common  roots,  and  a  friendship  of  common   civilisation.”   No,  it  wasn’t  a  pastor  at  a  local  church.  It  was  Binyamin  Netanyahu  speaking  at  a  conference  of  American  evangelicals  in  Jerusalem  in  April'   2008.   A  poll  taken  last  month  in  the  US  revealed  that  more  than  80  per  cent  of  Christians  stated  that  they  have  a  “moral  and  biblical”  obligation  to  love,  pray  and  support  Israel,  while  62  per  cent  of  evangelicals  said  that  Jerusalem  should  remain  its  undi  vided  capital.   Earlier  this  month,  Victorian  Jews  felt  the  love  as  400  Christians,  repre  senting  more  than  10  organisations,  gathered  in  Caulfield  for  a  “Stand  with  Israel”  evening.  The  affection  for  Israel  was  palpable.  Shorn  of  Christ  ian  signs,  such  as  the  cross,  the  event,  attended  by  several  leaders  of  the  Jewish  community,  featured  Israeli  dancing  and  songs,  banners  with  the  various  names  of  God,  waving  of  the  Israeli  flag,  standing  ovations  for  Israel,  as  well  as  speeches  praising   and  praying  for  the  Jewish  people.  Particularly  striking  was  an  apology  offered  by  an  elderly  German  woman  to  the  Jewish  people  for  the  evil  per  petrated  by  the  Nazis.   Baffling?  Only  to  those  who  don’t   understand  a  controversial  end-time   theology  that  began  in  19th-century  England  and  which  divides  history  into  eras  (dispensations).  Israel’s  cre  ation  and  the  1967  war  were  galvanis  ing  signs  that  God’s  hand  moves  in  history  and  the  clock  of  prophecy  had  started  up  again.  Driven  by  a  lit  eral  interpretation  that  prophesies  Israel’s  establishment  as  a  prelude  to  the  second  coming  of  Jesus,  tens  of  millions  are  now  convinced  they  are  living  in  the  final  days  as  described  in  the  Book  of  Revelation.   Standing  with  Israel  guarantees  them  being  on  God’s  side  when  the  battle  of  Armageddon  occurs  on  Israeli  soil.  In  the  final  battle,  it  should  be  noted,  most  Jews  are  wiped   out  and  the  rest  embrace  Christ  after  he  defeats  the  Antichrist.  Jews  who  don’t  accept  Jesus  are  condemned  to  eternal  damnation,  while  Christians  ascend  to  heaven.   Historical  examples  of  Christian  Zionists  include  William  Blackstone,  author  of  Jesus  is  Coming,  who  organ  ised  a  petition  for  restoring  Palestine  to  the  chosen  people,  Lord  Balfour  and  his  1917  declaration  and  Presi   dent  Truman  and  his  support  for  US  recognition  of  Israel,  despite  the  objections  of  the  State  Department   Some  are  worried  that  evangelical  support  is  driven  by  a  desire  to  con  vert  Jews.  Isi  Leibler,  however,  dis   misses  such  concerns.  Responding  to  a  ban  by  the  Israeli  Chief  Rabbinate  on  engaging  with  evangelical  groups,  Leibler  wrote  that  evangelicals  “are  the  most  fervent  supporters  of  Israel   in  the  western  world”.  Leibler   expressed  a  wish  that  some  Diaspora  Jews  would  exhibit  likeminded  pas  sion  and  commitment,  and  observed  that  as  an  observant  Jew  he’s  “com  fortable,  enthusiastic,  and  grateful”  for  the  backing.   Driven  by  a  literal   j  interpretation  that  I  prophesies  Israel's  I  establishment  as  a   |  prelude  to  the  second   |  coming  of  Jesus,  tens  of  j  millions  are  now   |  convinced  they  are   !  living  in  the  final  days  |  as  described  in  the   Book  of  Revelation.   Indeed,  an  increasing  number  emphasise  that  Christian  Zionism  is  based  on  the  biblical  promise  that  God  will  bless  those  who  bless  the  Jews  and  curse  those  who  curse  the  Jews.  For  many,  at  a  time  when  Israel  feces  the  threat  of  nuclear  annihilation  and  global  anti-Semitism  is  on  the  rise,  biblical  motives  count  for  little.   To  properly  understand  the  level  of  evangelical  devotion  to  Israel,  one  only  has  to  mention  Rabbi  Yechiel  Eckelstein,  an  Orthodox  rabbi  who   has  founded  The  International  Fel  lowship  of  Christians  and  Jews  (IFCJ).  The  IFCJ  has  raised  a  quarter   of-a-billion  US  dollars  for  various  projects  in  Israel.  The  Joshua  Fund,  an  evangelical  organisation,  aims  to  marshall  more  than  $100  million  to  fund  humanitarian  projects  in  Israel.   Nevertheless,  there  are  those  who  feel  a  discomfort  with  this  political  marriage.  Televangelist  Pat  Robert  son,  a  leading  Christian  Zionist,  did  say  at  the  time  of  Ariel  Sharon’s  stroke  that  Sharon  was  being  punished  for  withdrawing  from  Gaza  and  “divid  ing  God’s  land”.  John  Hagee,  John  McCain’s  pastor,  who  organises  an  annual  “Night  to  Honor  Israel”,  and  heads  Christians  United  for  Israel,  wrote  in  his  1996  book  that  the  assas  sination  of  Yizhak  Rabin  “launched  biblical  prophecy  onto  the  fast  track”.   Author  David  Brog  claims  that  Christian  Zionists  are  the  heirs  of  the   righteous  gentiles,  rejecting  “Replace  ment  Theology”  that  states  that  God  has  rejected  the  Jewish  people  and  that  Christians  had  become  the  chosen  people.  Successive  Israeli  governments  have  acknowledged  the  unbending  partnership  and  have  cultivated  the  friendship.   Are  Jews  the  pawns  in  a  Christian  prophecy  leading  the  way  to  the  end  of-days?  Only  if  you  believe  it.   Dr  Dvir  Abramovich,  the  Jan  Randa   senior  lecturer  in  Hebrew  and  Jewish  studies,  is  director  of  the  University  of  Melbourne’s  Centre  for   Jewish  History  and  Culture.  His  column  appears  monthly. ",2008-05-30
"  Judaism  in  early  Christian  times   PETER  KOHN   Judaism  in  Transition  175BCE-150BCE   (Melbourne,  2008)   COLLABORATION  between   six  Australian  Jewish  and  Christian  theologians  has  produced  a  compact  history  of  Judaism  at  the  dawn  of  the  previous  millennium,  when  Jewish  sages  faced  the  challenge  of  nascent  Christianity.   The  book,  Judaism  In  Transition  175BCE-150CE,  published  with  the  support  of  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  (CCJ)  Victoria,  was  launched  on  June  12  at  Monash  Uni  versity,  Caulfield,  by  Pratt  Foundation  chief  executive  Sam  Lipski  and  Mel  bourne  Catholic  priest  Father  Francis  Moloney.   Subjects  covered  in  the  book  include  Jewish  literature  of  the  period,  Torah  in  transition,  Jews  and  foreign  rule,  worship,  hopes  about  the  future  and  Jewish  attitudes  to  gentiles  in  the  first  century.   Lipski  said  he  was  struck  by  the  book’s  intensity.  “All  these  heroes  -  Hillel,  Shammai,  Yochanan  ben  Zachai,  Philo,  Bar  Kochba  -  march  through  the  book.  Because  it’s  man  ageable,  because  you  can  sit  down  and  read  it  and  go  back  and  read  it  again,  I  think  you  get  a  sense  of  the   period.  It  makes  no  pretensions  of  being  a  massive  scholarly  study  of  a   line  in  the  Mishnah.”   He  said  he  hopes  the  next  book  from  the  CCJ  will  be  about  Christian  ity  in  transition.   Father  Moloney,  who  made  headlines  last  year  with  his  book,  The  Gospel  According  To  Judas,  which  he  co-wrote  with  high-profile  British  author  Jeffrey  Archer,  suggesting  a  new  approach  to  Judas  in  Christian  theology,  said  Judaism  In  Transition   was  a  milestone  work.   Over  most  of  their  common   history,  Judaism  and  Christianity  held  entrenched  positions  and  rejected  each  other’s  legitimacy,  but  the  period   the  new  book  deals  with  was  a  time  of  greater  flexibility,  he  said.   “The  book  is  a  sign  that  the  fluid  and  the  familiar  of  Judaism  and  Christianity  in  that  period  are  possible  today,”  he  said  of  the  collabo  rative  project,  and  of  the  work  of  the  CCJ  in  general.   One  of  the  contributors,  Rabbi  Fred  Morgan,  senior  rabbi  at  Temple  Beth  Israel  (TBI),  spoke  about  his  essay  on  Torah.  “When  you  look  at  the  texts  from  the  period  and  you  read  the  works  of  scholars  who  are  trying  to  understand  the  Torah  in  transition,  you  begin  to  realise  that  they  are  hanging  huge  amounts  of  interpreta  tion  from  single  threads  of  text   “I  found  myself  confronted  with  the  fact  I  was  being  asked  to  write  a   history  of  a  period  and  an  idea  on  the  basis  of  actually  very  little  informa  tion.  We  have  to  use  what  we  under  stand  in  the  21st  century  —  our  feelings  and  relationships  with  the  material  -  to  kind  of  unpack  it,  and   that’s  what  I’ve  tried  to  do.”   1  entrenched  positions   I  I  and  rejected  each   other’s  legitimacy,  but  the  period  the   new  book  deals  with  was  a  time  of  greater  flexibility:'   FATHER  FRANCIS  MOLONEY   The  book’s  contributors  are  Associ  ate  Professor  James  McLaren,  who  is  its  editor,  Uniting  Church  ethicist  Rev  erend  Lorraine  Parkinson,  New  Testa  ment  theologian  Associate  Professor  David  Sim,  Great  Synagogue  emeritus  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple,  TBI  emeritus  Rabbi  John  Levi,  and  Rabbi  Morgan.   Professor  McLaren  said  of  the  contents  that  “some  [of  it  is]  hard,  some  pleasant,  all  of  it  enriching”.  He  envisages  schools  and  congregations  as  the  primary  audience,  but  said  the  book  will  also  appeal  to  anyone  interested  in  Jewish-Christian  ties.   |  ""Judaism  and   |  Christianity  held ",2008-06-27
"  DVDs   An  uplifting  tale   Rescue  Dawn  (DVD)  Christian  Bale,  Steve  Zahn,  Jeremy  Davies  MA15+   By  CPL  Mike  McSweeney   RESCUE  Dawn  is  the  true  story  of  German-born  Dieter  Dengler,  who  realises  his  ambi  tion  to  fly  by  joining  the  US  mili-   tary.  Played  by  Christian  Bale  (  Batman  ,  The  Prestige  ),  he  dis  covered  his  love  of  flight  as  a  child  the  moment  Allied  bomb  ers  demolished  his  village  in   Germany.  Dengler  is  an  unlikely  hero,  almost  irritatingly  optimis  tic  in  the  film's  early  stages,  and  the  polar  opposite  of  a  clean-cut  American-born  flyboy.  He  is  shot  down  over  Laos  on  his  first  mission  in  1966  and  is  captured.  Held  in  a  camp  with  several  Thai  POWs  and  two  Americans,  he  has  one  ambition:  to  escape  and  fly  again.  Steve  Zahn  and  Jeremy  Davies  put  in  exceptional  performances  as  the  two  American  POWs  who  have  spent  too  much  time  in  the  tropics  behind  bars.  Zahn,  Davies   and  Bale,  who  also  is  at  the  top  of  his  game,  lose  a  ridiculous  amount  of  weight  for  their  roles  and  their  interaction  on  camera  makes  for  some  dramatic  moments.  German  director  Werner  Herzog  has  avoided  any  links  to  the  bandana-wearing,  M60-  toting  stereotype  here,  yet  Rescue  Dawn  still  delivers  some  tense  moments.  It  is  a  tale  about  strength  of  character,  the  ability  to  remain  positive  even  in  the  direst  of  cir  cumstances  and  one  man's  unshak  able  determination  to  fly  again.

"  Kicking  for  peace   CHANTALAB5TB0L   ABOUT  160  Muslim,  Jewish,  Aborig  inal  and  Christian  youth  from  various  schools  —  including  Moriah,  Mount  Sinai  and  Masada  colleges  —  huddled  together  last  Thursday  for  a  chance  to   kick  balls  with  the  Israeli-Palestinian  team,  which  is  competing  in  the  AFL  International  Cup  this  week.   Vic  Alhadeff,  CEO  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  (NSW  JBD),  welcomed  the  youth  to  the  Aus  kick  Harmony  Day  clinic,  a  joint  ven  ture  of  the  Australian  Chapter  of  the  Peres  Centre,  AFL  NSW/ACT,  Erebus  International  and  the  NSW  JBD.   “We  leveraged  the  presence  of  the  Peace  Team  to  promote  a  message  of  goodwill,  harmony  and  acceptance  of  difference  here  in  Sydney,”  he  said.  “I  watched  the  team  train  in  Israel  six  months  ago,  and  it  is  inspi  rational  to  see  Muslim  and  Jewish  young  men  overcome  logistical  and  cultural  barriers  and  work  together  as  a  unit  The  symbolism  is  very  powerful.

"  Church  plans  Religious  festival   By  SAMANTHA  DEVINE   Members  of  the  Independent  Christian  Church  in  Torres  Strait  and  Kaiwalagal  Australia  Inc.  (ICTS&amp;K)  plan  to  hold  significant  religious  festival  project  later  this  year.  Named  the  Independent  Christian  Spiritual  Choral  Festival  (ICSCF)  the  group  is  optimistic  that  2008  will  be  the  first  of  what  is  hoped  will  become  an  annual  Torres  Strait  event.  While  the  ICSCF  will  contain  many  elements  familiar  to  festivals;  hoopla,  kai  kai,  arts  and  crafts  stalls  and  Island  dancing,  it  is  set  apart  from  others  in  that   it  is  designed  to  also  fulfill  the  need  for  spiritual  well-being  by  including  fellowship  hymns,  an  open-air  Thanksgiving  Service,  a  Healing  Ministry,  a  Procession  of  Witness,  Action  Choruses,  dramas  and  testimonies.  As  Mr  Robert  ""Bongo""  Sagigi  addressed  the  gathering,  he  talked  of  how  the  Gospel  had  come  to  Torres  Strait  Islanders  from  outside  but  has  now  become  an  important  and  embedded  part  of  Torres  Strait  culture.  Mr  Sagigi  stressed  the  importance  of  the  festival  in  engaging  the  youth  of  the  Torres  Strait.   ""The  festival  must  strive  to  foster  a  sense  of  belonging  and  ownership  of  Culture  with  the  emerging  generation  so  that  Culture  can  continue  to  be  celebrated  and  strengthened.""   As  the  group  moved  a  motion  to  hold  the  ICSCF  over  the  Fathers'  Day  weekend  of  September  5-6-7,  they  agreed  to  the  blending  of  Torres  Strait  Culture  with  worship  and  spirituality,  deeming  the   festival  free  to  attend  and  open  to  all  regardless  of  religious  affiliation.  In  addition  to  promoting  a  blend  of  culture  and  spirituality,  the  festival  is  also  designed  to  foster  a  harmonising  of  cul-   tures  with  Mass  being  printed  side-by-side  in  both  Language  and  English  to  welcome  all  who  wish  to  attend.

"  Youth  interfaith  encounters   A/W  STAFF   .MUSLIM,  Jewish  and  Christian  teenagers  explored  a  range  of  mutual-interest  issues  on  Sunday  at  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  (NSW  JBD)  Youth  Encounters  program.   Initiated  five  years  ago,  the  pro  gram  brings  300  students  from  the  three  major  frith  groups  together  annually.  The  NSW  JBD’s  Muslim  partner  in  the  program  is  the  Affinity  Intercultural  Foundation,  while  Kincoppal  College  Rose  Bay  is  its  Christian  partner.   On  Sunday,  70  students  from  Sule  College  (Muslim),  Kincoppal  College  (Christian),  Moriah  Col  lege  and  Emanuel  School  partici  pated  in  one  of  the  program’s  events  at  Moriah.  They  discussed  the  faith  challenges  facing  teenagers  in  modern-day  Aus   tralia,  the  challenges  facing  their  particular  communities,  personal  religious  practice,  their  religion’s  key  texts,  and  the  value  of  inter  faith  dialogue.   They  also  played  sport  with  facilitators  from  AusSport  and  enjoyed  a  falafel  lunch.   While  the  student  activities   were  underway,  the  Muslim,  Jewish  and  Christian  teachers  engaged  in  parallel  discussions.   NSW  JBD  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  said:  “The  value  of  this  program  cannot  be  over-emphasised.  A  major  antidote  to  racism  is  breaking  down  stereotypes  and  getting  to  know  ‘the  other’.  That’s  what  this  program  is  all  about”   Comments  from  students  who   participated  in  the  program  were  overwhelmingly  positive.

"  TEACH  KIDS  ABOUT  GOD   MICHAEL  Visontay  (AJN  21/12)  is  understandably  concerned  about  Christian  indoctrination  in  state  schools,  but  his  solution  -  “a  genuine  programme  of  comparative  religion”  -  is  not  a  good  one.   True  enough,  the  propagating  of  specifically  Christian  theology  in  a  multi-faith  society  is  less  than  desir-  able.  But  why  does  Visontay  advocate  replacing  it  with  a  sociology  course  that  no  more  inculcates  a  value  sys-  tem  than  maths,  English  or  history?   In  our  secular-dominated,  value  impoverished  society,  which  the  school  curriculum  reflects,  it  is  surely  essential  that  some  teaching  time  be  devoted  to  the  infusion  of  basic  ethi-   cal  and  moral  values  founded  upon  our  nation’s  Judeo-Christian  heritage.  In  a  country  where  more  people  still  believe  in  a  Deity  than  believe  in  sec-  ular  humanism,  we  do  our  nation’s  children  a  gross  disservice  by  keeping  the  G-word  at  arm’s  length.

"  Scholar’s  soft  line  on  messianic  Jews   PETER  KOHN   AN  American  Christian  divinity  scholar  who  is  participating  in  an  Australian  Jewish  study  program  has  said  the  Jewish  community  may  need  to  come  to  terms  with  Jews  who  believe  in  Jesus.   Professor  Amy-Jill  Levine  trains  Christian  pastors  at  Vanderbilt  Uni  versity  in  Nashville  and  describes  her  self  as  “a  Yankee-Jewish  feminist  who  teaches  in  a  predominantly  Protestant  divinity  school  in  the  buckle  of  the   Bible  belt”.   Prof  Levine  and  her  partner  Pro  fessor  Jay  Geller  are  lecturing  at  Monash  University’s  Australian  Centre  for  Jewish  Civilisation  Winter  School  program  this  month.   On  the  subject  of  messianic  Jews,  Prof  Levine  said  that  for  many  people  there  was  a  “dividing  line  here  over  which  one  cannot  step”  and  “once  the  Jewish  person  accepts  Jesus  as  lord  and  saviour,  that  person  is  no  longer  a  Jew,  but  a  Christian”.  She  said  she  respected  that  view  but  also  looked  at  the  subject  from  “the  other  side”.   Prof  Levine  said  it  was  an  “excep  tionally  complicated  issue”  because  Jews  who  say  they  accept  Jesus  have  “palpable  and  real”  views.  “It’s  often  easier,”  she  said,  “to  simply  say  ‘I’m  not  a  Jew  for  Jesus,  I’m  a  Presbyterian  or  Lutheran  or  Catholic’,  but  what  happens  when  they  want  to  hang  on  to  that  Jewish  identity,  and  what  do  we  do  with  that  individual’s  family?”   “One  could  look  at  them  simply  as  a  Christian,  one  could  look  at  them  from  a  traditional  Jewish  perspective  as  a  ‘bad’  Jew  or  an  apostate  Jew,  or  a   Professor  Amy-Jill  Levine...  concern  at  the  Impact  on  Jewish  families.   very  confused  Jew.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  argument  is  that  they  have  a  different  way  to  the  divine,  a  different  pathway  to  God,  then  I  can  say  the  atheist  Jew  doesn’t  care  about  God  at  all.  Why  would  I  accept  one  and  not  the  other?”   “One  could  look  at  them  simply  as  a  Christian,   one  could  look  at  them   I  from  a  traditional  Jewish   perspective  as  a  'bad'   Jew  or  an  apostate  Jew,  or  a  very  confused  Jew.”   PROF  AMY-jILL  LEVINE  Christian  divinity  scholar   Prof  Levine  said  she  was  con   cerned  at  the  impact  on  Jewish  fami  lies.  “Sometimes  children  of  these   marriages  will  say  to  their  grandpar  ents,  ‘Gee,  bubby  and  zaide,  it’s  too  bad  you’re  going  to  hell?’ ",2008-07-11
"  REAL  HOLIDAY  SPIRIT   IMAGINE.  Christmas  and  Chanukah  fell  around  the  same  time.  What  if  the  Jewish-Christian  communities  came  together  for  a  very  special  and  different  holiday  period  in  keeping  with  the  spirit  of  these  two  religions,  which  with  Islam  take  as  their  “father”  the  prophet  Abraham.

"  WHY  DENIGRATE  JEWS?   AS  a  Christian,  I  find  the  media’s  treatment  of  the  Jewish  faith  of  many  of  Australia’s  most  valuable  citizens  appalling.  Why  is  it  required  by  the  media  to  mention  anybody  is  “Jewish”,  as  in  the  “reporting”  by  the  media  of  Rodney  Adler  and  Richard  Pratt  with  their  recent  respective   brushes  with  the  law  ?   Sir  John  Monash  (Aussie  of  Jewish  faith)  was  Australia’s  greatest  military  commander.  In  fact,  Monash,  is  one  of  our  greatest  Aussies  ever!

"  Anti-missionaries  suspected  in  attack   YAAKOV  LAPPIN   ARIEL  -  Police  investigating  the  sending  of  a  package  which  exploded  in  the  home  of  a  Christian  pastor  in  Ariel  (a  settlement  in  the  West  Bank)  are  leaning  toward  the  theory  that  a  Jewish  anti-missionary  was  behind  the  attack,  the  preacher  said  on  Sunday.   David  Oritz’s  16-year-old  son,  Ami,  sustained  serious  injuries  in  the  blast,  after  opening  the  package,  which  was  made  to  look  like  a  Purim  gift.   “They  [the  police],  as  far  as  I  under  stand,  do  not  suspect  Palestinian  ter  rorism.  They  suspect  a  Jewish  anti-missionary  motive,”  Oritz  said  min   utes  after  returning  from  the  hospital.   Ami’s  life  was  no  longer  in  danger,  his  father  said,  but  he  was  still  suffering  from  serious  injuries  all  over  his  body.   Oritz  said  that  he  considered  his  son’s  recovery  to  be  “a  miracle"".  Oritz’s  Jewish  born  wife,  Leah,  is  a  member  of  Jews  for  Jesus.The  pastor  says  dozes  of  families  in  Ariel  have  been  influenced  by  his  teach  ings.  “We  have  about  50  families,""  he  declared.   He  described  a  long  history  of  ten  sions  with  anti-missionary  activists  in  Ariel,  which  included  flyers  and  a  petition  calling  for  the  family  to  leave  the  city.

"  MEDIA  ON  ISRAEL   GREG  Sheridans  feature  article  on   Israel,  “Deep  Inside  the  Plucky  Coun-  try”  (The  Australian,  19/01),  goes  a  long  way  to  correcting  the  widespread  media  imbalance  in  reporting  about   Israel.   His  assertion  that  “the  world   media  makes  a  mistake  by  using  the  same  reporters  to  cover  the  Palestin  ian  territories  as  well  as  Israel”  squares  directly  with  reporting  on  recent  events  in  Gaza,  where  Israel  has  taken  controversial  but  arguably  necessary  steps  to  address  the  escalating  bom-  bardment  of  its  territory  by  Palestin-   ian  terrorists.   Palestinian  claims  that  Gaza’s  only  power  station  has  been  closed  down  “for  want  of  fuel”,  according  to  its  director  Rafiq  Mliha,  are  not  ade-  quately  balanced  in  media  reports,  and  especially  headlines,  by  claims  from  Israel  (which  provides  two  thirds  of  Gaza’s  power  from  rocket  attacked  Ashkelon!),  that  the  territory   still  has  sufficient  fuel  stocks.   Sheridan  correctly  states  that  Israel,  since  leaving  Lebanon  and  Gaza,  “was  subject  to  thousands  of  rocket  attacks  from  southern   Lebanon  until  it  went  to  war  with  Hezbollah  and  now  every  day  Kassam  rockets  are  fired  from  Gaza  at  nearby  Israeli  civilian  towns,  especially   Sderot”.   Media  pictures  of  Palestinian  chil-  dren  holding  candles  during  a  protest  against  fuel  cuts  should  at  least  be  bal-  anced  by  pictures  of  little  children  in  Sderot  huddling  in  fear  as  rockets  scream  daily  over  their  heads.   Sheridan  also  provides  a  correc-  tion  to  media  references  to  Israel’s  “wall”  when  he  writes  that  “terrorists  were  murdering  1500  of  [Israel’s]  cit-  izens  a  year.  Now,  with  the  security  barrier,  wrongly  labelled  a  wall  when  it  is  mostly  a  fence,  terrorist  infiltra-  tion  is  much  more  difficult.”   What  refreshing  reporting!

"  Avoiding  a  heart  of  tin   ADF  members  experiencing  personal  issues  have  a  range  of  services  open  to  them,  LT  Bill  Heck  writes.   LIKE  Hans  Christian  Andersen's  steadfast  Tin  Soldier,  Australian  soldiers,  sailors  and  airmen  have   bravely  done  their  duty  but  strug  gled  to  communicate  -  sometimes  with  tragic  results.  The  ADF  provides  a  range  of  wel  fare  services  for  members  who  might  be  struggling  with  their  relationships  or  their  mental  wellbeing,  but  there  is  often  a  reluctance  to  access  help.  MAJ  Lindsay  Bancroft  of  DCO  said  one  of  the  biggest  challenges  for  his  organisation  was  to  encourage  families  to  participate  in  events  and  workshops.  ""We  have  lots  of  good  programs  and  support  for  families  but  are  continu  ally  faced  with  the  problem  of  market  ing  our  services  and  getting  people  to  attend,""  he  said.  MAJ  Bancroft  said  poor  commu  nication  was  one  of  the  fundamental  problems  leading  to  anger,  which  then  could  escalate  into  conflict.   ""The  Australian  man  likes  to  be  seen  as  being  tough,  strong  and  in  charge  but  when  it  comes  to  communicating  he  often  doesn't  know  what  to  say  or  how  to  say  it,""  he  said.  ""It  seems  some  men  are  scared  that  ivhat  they  say  or  the  emotions  they  express  will  be  perceived  as  a  sign  of  weakness.""  It  is  a  misconception  to  regard  a  mental  health  issue  as  career-ending,  according  to  MAJ  Paula  Stratton,  OC  of  the  Psych  Support  Section.  ""Our  job  is  to  get  personnel  back  to  where  they  were  and  help  them  cope  with  life's  pressures,  not  have  them  kicked  out.  In  10  years  in  this  job  I  can  only  remember  a  handful  of  occasions  when  a  member  seeking  help  has  suf  fered  a  negative  impact  on  his  career,""  MAJ  Stratton  said.  ""Generally,  the  ear  lier  someone  seeks  help  the  easier  their  problem  is  to  solve,  which  results  in  less  impact  on  their  career.""  Deployments,  courses  and  support  for  other  units  put  pressure  on  families  and  that  creates  a  challenge  between   work  and  family  life.  Army  Padre  Catie  Inches-Ogden  said  the  most  important  thing  for  Defence  personnel,  and  those  who  love  them,  was  to  remember  what  was  important.  ""If  someone  demon  strates  inappropriate  behaviour,  there  is  always  a  root  cause  or  reason  that  can  be  teased  out,""  she  said.  The  welfare  services  stress  that  every  individual  is  different,  not  only  in  regard  to  their  needs  but  also  in  their  treatment  because  there  is  no  template.  They  suggest  that  any  member  who  might  have  a  problem  should  talk  to  somebody  who  can  direct  them  to  help.  From  there,  the  individual  member  makes  the  decisions  based  on  the  range  of  services  available  for  the  problems  he  or  she  might  experience.  While  there  is  honour  in  being  stead  fast,  there  is  no  glory  at  all  in  reducing  relationships  to  a  cinder  by  not  asking  for  help.

"  Inter-faith  dialogue   ASK  THE  RABBI   RABBI  RAYMOND  APPLE   Why  is  it  that  so  few  Orthodox  rabbis  become  involved  in  inter-faith  dialogue?   i  T  is  true  that  a  visible  feature  of   I  the  Christian-Jewish  dialogue  is  i  the  invisibility  of  the  Orthodox   rabbis,  so  much  so  that  Israel’s  chief  rabbis  have  surprised  many  by  hav  ing  meetings  with  Christian  leaders.   The  dialogue  movement  has  the   involvement  of  modem  Orthodox  rabbis  in  a  number  of  countries,  but  most  of  their  colleagues,  whether  modem  Orthodox  or  -  especially  -  Charedi,  take  no  interest  and  warn  against  any  involvement.   The  reasons  include  the  follow   ing:   •  Jews  have  suffered  so  much  from  Christians  that  they  only  want   to  be  left  alone.   •  Jews  suspect  that  Christians  still  want  to  proselytise  them.   •  Jews  believe  that  Christianity  has  no  real  respect  for  Judaism.   •  Jews  see  religion  as  a  personal   matter  that  cannot  be  discussed  with  outsiders.   •  Jews  see  all  faiths  as  the  product  of  particular  historical  circumstances  which  outsiders  cannot  share.   •  Jews  respect  the  conscience  of  adherents  of  all  friths  and  see  no   reason  for  them  to  subject  their  beliefs  to  scrutiny.   •  Jews  see  strengthening  Judaism  as  a  more  urgent  task.   «  Jews  see  working  together  to  improve  society  as  more  important  than  talking  about  religious  concepts.   •  Jews  see  Christianity  as  only  one  philosophy  in  a  broader  spectrum  and  feel  that  good  relations  with  others  may  be  more  important.   These  are  arguments  put  forward  at  different  times  and  with  differing  emphases  by  rabbinic  figures  such  as  the  Lubavitcher  Rebbe,  Rabbi  Joseph  B  Soloveitchik,  Professor  Eliezer  Berkovits  and  others.   However,  those  rabbis  who  do  participate  in  the  dialogue  aigue  that  every  human  group  needs  to  be  on  good  terms,  especially  those  which  foster  a  spiritual  and  ethical  approach  to  the  world.  They  argue  that  Chris  tianity  is  trying  to  overcome  its  anti  Jewish  past  and  its  hand  of  friendship  should  not  be  spumed.  They  also  argue  that  the  Christian-Jewish  dia  logue  is  generally  not  “dialogue”  in  the  deepest  sense,  in  which  the  partners  enter  into  each  other’s  mind,  soul  and  being.  Instead,  they  strongly  believe  that  when  engaged  in  judiciously,  the  dialogue  improves  the  climate  of  relationships  -  an  end  to   which  all  should  contribute.

"  The  loudest  prayer  of  all   PARTISAN   SAMUPSKI   There  is  still  a  place  for   The  Lord's  Prayer  in  federal  Parliament  but  with  some   caveats.   As  a  Jew,  I  don't  object  to  The  Lord's  Prayer  in   Parliament,  or  anywhere  else  in  public.  One   reason:  it's  a  beautiful   prayer.  But  also  because  there’s  nothing  in  its  wording  that  should   offend  believing  Jews.   S""   IN  the  beginning  was  the  word,   and  my  word,  for  what  it’s  worth,  is  that  I  support  the  retention  of  The  Lord’s  Prayer  in  the  Parlia   ment  of  Australia.  I  look  forward  to   hearing  Handel’s  Messiah  all  through  December,  and  I  regard  Verdi’s  Requiem  Mass  as  the  most  sublime   choral  music.   But  I  also  understand  why  the  Swiss  theologian  Karl  Barth  said  that  when  the  angels  in  heaven  sing  praise  to  God,  they  choose  Bach  -  although  he  did  suggest  that  at  home  by  them  selves  they  prefer  Mozart.  You  don’t  have  to  be  a  Christian  to  agree.  Music  is  the  ultimate  ecumenical  language.   Which  is  why  I’m  sorry  I  missed  the  Shalom  concert  last  Sunday,  organised  by  the  Council  of  Chris  tians  and  Jews,  which  I  fervently  sup  port  and  urge  more  Jews  to  join.   At  the  same  time,  I  strongly  oppose  overtly  Christian  prayers,  symbols  and  celebrations  in  our  government  schools  because  taxpayer-funded  schools  stand  in  loco  parentis,  that  is  -  in  place  of  the  parents  and  families.   Hardly  surprising,  I  also  abhor  the  teaching  of  eternal  damnation  for  Jews  and  other  non-Christians  by  some  mainstream  Christian  clerics  in  Australia,  an  excrescence  far  more  disturbing  than  the  mutterings  of  the   hapless  and  witless  Wollongong  Bap  tist  minister  about  the  Jews  suffering  “a  sin  affliction”,  as  reported  in  last  week’s  AJN.  And  the  relentless  one  sided  political  campaign  against  Israel  for  the  past  50  years,  and  more,  by  some  Christian  organisations  in  Aus  tralia,  all  too  often  smacks  of  an  ancient  hatred  of  the  Jewish  people.   My  point  is  that  distinctions  should  be  made.  And  not  just  by  Jew  ish  leaders,  who  really  need  to  think  twice  before  commenting  in  The  AJN  every  time  a  Christian  cleric  says  something  stupid  or  nasty.  Each  of  us,  Jewish  and  non-Jewish,  religious,  agnostic  and  atheist,  needs  constantly  to  work  through  the  distinctions  and  contradictions  in  a  rapidly  changing  and  simultaneously  Christian,  multi  faith,  post-Christian,  and  secular  society.   This  brings  up  The  Lord’s  Prayer  in  Parliament  My  fellow  AJN  Colum  nist  Sidra  Kranz  Moshinsky  (07/11)  wants  it  replaced.  I  waht  it  retained.   As  a  Jew,  I  don’t  object  to  The  Lord’s  Prayer  in  Parliament  or  any  where  else  in  public.  It’s  a  beautiful  prayer  and  there’s  nothing  in  its  wording  that  should  offend  believing  Jews.  Unlike  some  other  Christian  prayers,  it  doesn’t  address  Jesus  or  express  a  belief  that  he’s  the  son  of   God  or  the  Messiah.   Both  Christian  and  Jewish  scholars  agree  that  the  prayer’s  author  knew  the  Jewish  liturgy,  although  they  differ   on  the  source  for  the  New  Testament   prayer’s  more  widely  used  version  (Matthew  VI/  9-13),  which  is  recited   in  Parliament   Of  course,  it  is  ultimately  a  Chris  tian,  not  Jewish,  or  even  deist  prayer,  because  the  “Lord”  in  The  Lord’s   Prayer  is  Jesus,  not  God.  Which  is  why  I  don’t  recite  it  And  why  I  expect  that  if  one  day  a  Jewish,  Muslim,  Hindu,  Buddhist,  or  conscientious  non  believing  Speaker  wasn’t  prepared  to  say  it  another  parliamentarian  would   do  so.   The  main  reason,  however,  for  retaining  The  Lord’s  Prayer  in  a;  plu  ralist  society  comes  down  to  an  ""on  balance”  argument  In  the  absence  of  majority  public  opposition,  I  believe  that  a  prayer  -  which  doesn’t  demean  other  faiths  or  beliefs,  and  maintains  a  century-old  parliamentary  tradition  -  still  has  value  and  meaning.  As  such,  maintaining  it  should  carry  more  weight  than  any  objections  from   minorities.   But  I  offer  two  caveats.  Firstly,  if  public  sentiment  among  a  majority  of  Australians  changed,  much  as  has  happened  with  the  weakening  ties  to  the  British  monarchy,  then  Parliament   should  get  the  message.  Until  then,  in  the  same  way  as  the  connection  to  the  monarchy  continues  even  if  most  Australians  no  longer  believe  in  it,  the  tradition  should  be  respected.   But  secondly,  the  Parliament  might  consider  the  example  of  the  US  Congress.  Despite  its  separation  of  church  and  state,  American  legislators  also  commence  proceedings  with  prayers  from  Christian  chaplains.  But  every  how  and  then,  they  welcome  Jewish,  Muslim,  Hindu  and  other  faith  representatives.   Perhaps  Canberra  could  be  even  more  innovative  than  Washington.  It  could  retain  The  Lord’s  Prayer  for  most  proceedings,  invite  an  occasional  non-Christian  to  reflect  a  changing  Australia,  and  once  a  year  begin  with  the  sounds  of  silence.  That  might  res  onate  as  the  loudest  prayer  of  all.   Sam  Lipski  is  the  chief  executive  of   the  Pratt  Foundation  and  a  former  editor  of  The  AJN.

"  Value  your  memories   THE  theme  of  June's  Air  Force  Val  ues  competition  was  'Anzac'.  There  were  many  powerful  stories  submitted,  but  none  quite  as  moving  as  the  follow-   ing  winner.  GPL  Cynthia  Swan.  Base  Command  Post,  RAAF  Base  Wiiamtown  I  can  honestly  say  that  I  was  most  proud  to  be  in  the  Air  Force  on  Anzac  Day  this  year.  It  was  the  first  opportu  nity  that  I  had  to  wear  my  medals  after  receiving  them  for  my  deployments  in  2005,  2006  and  2007.  I  am  extremely  proud  to  have  received  my  medals,  but  the  Humanitarian  Overseas  Service  Medal  (HOSM)  for  Operation  Sumatra  Assist  will  always  hold  a  special  place  in  my  heart.  It  is  forever  dedicated  to  the  memory  of  my  wonderful  brother-in-law  Christian  Nott  and  his  beautiful  wife  Moi  Vogel  (pictured  above  right).  It  was  the  day  after  Boxing  Day  2004.  1  can  remember  watching  the  news  on  TV  and  not  quite  understanding  the  enormity  of  what  was  unfolding  around  the  world.  A  tsunami  had  hit  parts  of  Asia,  the  death  toll  was  rising,  the  list  of  countries  affected  was  increasing  and  among  the  chaos  we  suddenly  realised  that  my  brother-in-law  and  his  wife  were  on  their  honeymoon  in  Thailand.  They  had  sent  us  an  SMS  on  Christmas  Day  wishing  everyone  a  Merry  Christmas  and  letting  their  family  and  friends  know  that  they  were  expect-   ing  a  baby.  My  husband  Marcus  called  Richard  (Christian's  dad)  to  see  if  he  had  heard  from  them,  but  he  said  they  had  not  been  in  touch  but  it  was  still  early  and  they  would  be  fine.  For  the  next  couple  of  days  we  wait  ed  for  the  phone  to  ring  and  for  some  good  news.  We  tried  to  remain  positive  and  prayed  that  we  would  hear  from  them  soon.  On  New  Years  Day  after  a  day  out  with  family  and  friends,  we  returned  home  to  find  a  message  from  my  CO  on  our  answering  machine.  I  returned  the  call,  and  found  out  that  I  had  been  selected  to  deploy  to  Medan,  Indonesia,  to  work  in  the  JTFHQ  as  the  operations  clerk.  I  remember  explaining  to  him  that  we  had  family  members  in  Thailand  and  they  were  still  unaccounted  for  and  that  I  was  really  happy  to  accept  this  deploy  ment  as  it  would  be  my  way  of  helping  out  in  such  devastating  circumstances.  I  deployed  to  Medan  on  January  3,  2005,  and  began  working  in  the  JTFHQ.  My  detachment  commander  and  col  leagues  were  aware  that  Christian  and  Moi  were  missing  and  they  were  all  extremely  supportive.  My  commander  told  me  to  keep  him  informed  and  if  I  felt  that  I  needed  to  go  home  at  any  stage  to  let  him  know.  Within  two  weeks  of  being  deployed,  I  received  news  from  Marcus  that  they  had  found  Christian's  body,  and  that  they  were  still  looking  for  Moi.  We  were  shattered;  this  was  not  supposed  to  hap-   pen.  It  was  so  unfair  -  they  were  on  their  honeymoon,  expecting  a  baby  and  were  so  young.  There  were  so  many  thoughts  running  through  my  mind.  I  shouldn't  be  here;  I  felt  extremely  guilty  that  I  had  deployed  and  left  my  husband  at  home  at  such  a  distressing  time.  When  they  had  discovered  Moi's  body,  I  knew  I  needed  to  go  home  to  be  with  Marcus.  After  returning  to  work  at  77SQN,  Marcus  approached  his  admino  to  let  her  know  what  was  going  on.  His  CO  and  admino  were  professional  and  supportive,  and  the  CO  requested  that  I  be  returned  to  Australia  after  three  weeks  in  Medan.  Upon  my  return,  Marcus  and  I  received  ongoing  support  from  family  and  friends,  the  Air  Force  chaplains  at  RAAF  Base  Williamtown  and  the  staff  at  77SQN,  which  we  are  thankful  for.  The  memorial  for  Christian  and  Moi  was  held  in  Sydney  on  February  20,  2005.  It  was  extremely  emotional;  they  had  touched  so  many  people.  They  had  lived  life  to  the  fullest  and  always  val  ued  the  time  they  spent  with  family  and  friends,  which  would  be  their  legacy.  I  received  my  HOSM  in  2007;  I  was  very  happy  and  sincerely  grateful.  Not  only  did  this  medal  represent  all  of  the  lives  that  were  lost  and  the  families  that  were  destroyed  by  the  Boxing  Day  tsu  nami,  it  also  represented  the  enormous  humanitarian  effort  that  the  men  and  women  of  the  ADF  contributed  to.  In  particular,  for  my  family  and  me,  this   medal  represented  Christian  and  Moi.  Wearing  my  medals  this  Anzac  Day  was  very  important  to  me  and  I  am  happy  to  talk  about  my  experiences,  especially  when  people  point  at  the  HOSM  and  ask   ""What  is  that  one  for?""  I  tell  them  that  it  was  for  the  Boxing  Day  tsunami  and  that  it  means  the  most  to  me.  It  stands  out  from  the  rest  and  it's  rare,  just  like  Christian  and  Moi.

"  Baptist  minister’s  hellish   comments  spark  Jewish  ire   CHANTAl  ABSTBOL   A  WOLLONGONG  Baptist  minister  has  admitted  he  told  two  Jewish  emis  saries  that  Jews  suffer  from  a  sin  affliction,  and  will  face  a  fate  “worse  than  the  Holocaust”  because  they  don’t  accept  Jesus  as  the  messiah.   The  comments  have  sparked  out  rage  among  Jewish  groups  and  inter   faith  leaders.   American-born  Pastor  Kevin  Har  ris,  of  the  Illawarra  Community  Bap  tist  Church,  made  the  comments  in  a  private  meeting  last  Thursday  with  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  (JBD)  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  and  educa  tion  manager  Lynda  Ben-Menashe,  who  were  touring  the  area  on  a  bridge-building  exercise  as  part  of  the  JBD’s  speaker  service.   Pastor  Harris  said  he  told  them  that  anyone  who  did  not  accept  Jesus  suffered  from  a  “cancer”  and  that  Jews  were  doomed  to  face  “a  period  of  tribulation  worse  than  the  Holo  caust”,  according  to  Christian  scripture.   “We  don’t  wish  this  ill  time  upon  them.  We  love  the  Jewish  people.  [I’m]  just  quoting  Jesus,”  the  Ameri  can-born  Pastor  Harris  told  The  AJN.  “All  of  us  have  the  cancer  of  sin,  and  there’s  one  solution:  Jesus  Christ.  I  liken  it  to  cancer  to  show  that  it’s  fatal.  Those  of  us  who  reject  Jesus  as  the  saviour  ...  all  of  us,  Jew  or  Gentile,  would  spend  eternity  without  God  in   hell”   Alhadeff  said  it  was  a  “chilling  experience”  to  be  on  the  receiving  end  of  the  pastor’s  comments.   Pastor  Kevin   Harris  told  Hie  AJN:  ""Anybody  that  does  not  receive  Jesus   Christ  is  going  to  hell  of  their  own  choice.”   “We  told  him  we  appreciated  the  candour  of  his  remarks,  but  found  his  position  completely  unaccept  able,”  Alhadeff  said.  “While  one  is  only  too  aware  that  there  are  funda   mentalist  beliefs  and  extremist   preachers  out  there,  his  brazen  approach  and  the  fact  that  he  is  influ  encing  others  on  a  daily  basis  are  the   issues  of  real  concern  ”   CONTINUED  ON  NEWS  4   Minister’s  hellish  comments   CONTINUED  FROM  NEWS  1   Peta  Jones  Pellach,  an  expert  in  interfaith  relations,  said  she  does  not  believe  the  pastor's  comments  reflected  the  official  views  of  churches  throughout  Australia.   ""Unfortunately,  nutters  can  also  become  Christian  ministers,”  she  said.  ""I  think  any  of  the  organised  churches  would  be  horrified.”   Jones  Pellach  added  that  the  com  ments  highlighted  the  current  challenges  facing  interfaith  work.  ""Sometimes  when  someone  makes  extreme  comments  like  these,  the  church  recognises  they  have  more  work  to  do,  in  terms  of  spreading  the  true  Christian  message,  which  is  not  about  vilifying  Jews.”   Australian  Council  of  Christian  and  Jews  past-president  Henry  Mendelson  added:  ""This  sort  of  thing  has  to  stop.  We  have  to  accept  that  we’re  not  living  in  a  Bible-belt  society,  and  that  we've  pro  gressed  from  the  narrowness  of  the  atti  tude  that  one  religion  is  superior  to  another.”   NSW  Baptist  Union  general-secretary  Alan  Soden  said  Pastor  Harris  was  not  a  registered  member  of  the  union  and  declined  to  comment  specifically  on  his  comments,  but  stressed  the  Baptist  Church  respected  the  rights  of  other  faiths  to  have  their  own  views.  “Major  world  religions  have  many  differences  and  a  person  of  faith  should  not  be  expected  to  commit  intellectual  suicide,  in  order  to  follow  a  particular  faith.  How  ever  any  dialogue  must  take  place  in  a   spirit  of  mutual  respect  and  goodwill.”   B'nai  B'rith  Anti-Defamation  Commis  sion  (ADC)  chairman  Tony  Levy  said  the  pastor's  comments  were  offensive  “not  only  to  Jews,  but  to  billions  of  human  beings  around  the  world,  who  are  not  Christian”.

HENRY  MENDELSON  Australian  Council  of   Christian  and  Jews   He  also  said  the  pastor's  reference  to  the  Holocaust  was  particularly  dis  tressing  for  Holocaust  survivors.   “The  ADC  works  hard  to  combat  anti  Semitism  and  to  promote  tolerance  and  understanding  in  the  wider  community.  Unfortunately,  Pastor  Harris'  shameful  views  may  inflame  anti-Semitic  senti  ments  among  his  congregants,  and  also  give  succour  to  those,  in  the  wider  com  munity,  who  harbour  and  promote  anti  Semitic  ideas,”  Levy  said.  “We  are  also  concerned  that  efforts  to  promote  a  greater  sense  of  harmony  in  multicultural  Australia  could  be  harmed  by  such  com  ments,  which  obviously  target  not  only  Jewish  people,  but  all  non-Christians.” ",2008-11-21
"  ALL  CHARITY  IS  GOOD   I  AGREE  that  charity  should  indeed  begin  at  home  (AJN  01/02),  but  also  think  there  is  room  to  stretch  out  the   hand  of  friendship  and  support  to  those  needing  assistance  outside  our  homes,  where  we  have  the  means  to  do   so.   As  a  non-Jew  and  a  volunteer  at  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum,  I  am  very  aware  of  the  huge  social  and  poverty  problems  that  are  being  faced  and  endured  by  many  Israelis  in  the  State  of  Israel.  In  his  letter,  M  Stone  says  “there  are  no  non-Jewish  organisa  tions  that  work  with  Israel  or  Jews  -  the  only  organisations  or  volunteers  that  look  after  Israeli  or  Jewish  prob  lems  are  Jews  themselves”.   Is  the  writer  unaware  of  a  number   of  Christian  organisations,  such  as  Bridges  for  Peace,  Christian  Friends  of  Israel  and  the  International  Christian  Embassy  Jerusalem,  to  name  just  three?  These  are  very  active  in  pro  viding  support  to  Israel  and  assistance  to  many  poverty-stricken  Jews.  These  organisations  are  not  missionary  groups.  Many  thousands  of  non  Jewish  volunteers  work  with  these  organisations  in  Israel  on  either  long   or  short-term  programs  to  bring  com  fort  and  hope  to  needy  Israelis  and  Jews  and  to  support  the  State  of  Israel.   I  do  think  Stone’s  suggestion  that  the  Jewish  day  schools  should  educate  the  Jewish  children  about  the  huge  problems  that  many  people  face  in  Israel  would  be  helpfbl.  Perhaps  the  day  schools  are  already  doing  this,  but  need  to  make  it  more  of  a  priority.   FRANK  WOOD   Thomleigh,  NSW ",2008-02-08
"  ON  THE  PRISONER  EXCHANGE   DESPITE  all  the  rhetoric  and  the  obscene  celebrations  by  Hezbollah  and  the  corrupt  Lebanese  govern  ment,  and  although  it  is  little  con   Trying  to  understand  and  sympa  thise  with  every  possible  viewpoint  is  simply  counterproductive.  This  sim  ply  reinforces  a  belief  among  some  that  everything  is  acceptable  and  that  one  can  believe  in  any  other  religion  or  any  form  of  idolatry  and  Judaism  will  still  accommodate  that  individ  ual.  This  is  dearly  nonsense.   There  is  no  getting  away  from  the  fact  that  accepting  the  Christian  sav   iour  as  the  Messiah  makes  one  a  Christian  and  no  amount  of  soul   searching,  however  passionate,  how  ever  devastating  it  may  be  to  other  family  members,  will  allow  one  to  retain  his  or  her  Jewish  identity,  once   this  red  line  is  crossed   GiL  SOLOMON  Dover  Heights,  NSW ",2008-07-25
"  US  divinity  educator   As  a  Jewish  academic  teaching  about  Jesus  in  America’s  Bible  Belt,  what  kinds  of  pressures  do  yon  deal  with?   At  times,  it’s  a  double  challenge  -  being  Jewish  and  teaching  in  that  part  of  the  country  -  and  sometimes  a  few  of  my  students  will  say,  “What  could  that  Jew  possibly  teach  me?”  On  the  oilier  hand,  my  mother  once  described  me  in  my  work  situation  as  “an  infidel  rather  than  an  apos  tate”.  I  was  never  a  Christian,  so  I’m  not  required  to  toe  any  party  line.  I  can  express  to  my  students  views  they  might  not  be  willing  to  hear  if  they  were  from  a  fellow  Christian.   Take  me  through  your  academic  journey  to  your  current  post  at   Vanderbilt   I  started  as  a  double  major  in  English  and  religion  because  I  was  always  interested  in  how  texts  work  and  how  stories  create  worlds.  I  was  also  interested  in  recovering  my  own  Jewish  history.  I  did  a  masters  and  PhD  at  a  primarily  Methodist  school.  My  first  teaching  job  was  at  a  Quaker  school.  Fifteen  years  ago,  my  husband  [Professor  Jay  Geller]  and  I  were  both  “bought”  by  Vanderbilt  University  in  Nashville,  much  as  you  would  buy  an  athlete,  and  we  both  teach  in  the  Divinity  School.  I  work  with  PhD  students  and  with  those  interested  in  becoming  Christian  pastors.   What  insights  do  you  bring  to  your  teachings  that  are  specifically  from  your  own  Jewish  heritage?   Some  of  the  questions  I  ask  stem  from  my  own  curiosity  about  ancient  Judaism  and  I’ll  also  be  able  to  provoke  from  the  stu  dents  questions  and  answers  they  might  not  have  consid  ered  about  Jesus:  how  did  he  understand  the  Sabbath,  how  did  he  lead  a  Jewish,  religious,  practical  life?   What  perceptions  do  students  and  colleagues  have  of  the  nexus  between  Judaism  and  Christianity?   A  number  of  my  students  think  early  Judaism,  and  indeed  Judaism  for  all  times,  is  overly  misogynistic  and  elitist  -  then  Jesus  came  along  with  this  happy  “God-loves   you”  attitude.  The  Pharisees,  who  Jesus  thought  of  as  too  focused  on  the  minutiae  of  religious  life,  are  seen  in  the  Dead  Sea  Scrolls  as  making  Judaism  too  easy.  When  we  look  at  various  sources,  rather  than  a  monolithic  evil  Judaism  on  one  side  and  Jesus  on  the  other,  we  can  see  how  Jesus  fits  very  nicely  within  the  rich  diversity  of  early  Judaism.   Is  there  an  Intrinsically  Jewish  perspective  of  the  crudfbdon  narrative  and  how  do  you  teach  it  and  discuss  it  with  your  students?  I’d  be  hesitant  to  say  there’s  an  intrinsically  Jewish  perspective  on  anything.  It’s  unfor-  .  tunate  that  most  Jews  haven’t  read  the  New  Testament  and  are  unfamiliar  with  first-century  history.  Jesus  was  one  of  thousands  crucified.  There’s  the  histor  ical  and  political,  but  I  also  want  to  dis  cuss  with  my  colleagues  the  theological  implications  of  the  crucifixion.  In  working  with  Jews,  I  try.  to  explain  how  Christian  groups  understand  the  cross  and  thereby   help  Jews  understand  their  Christian  neigh   bours  better.   MJg  time  goes  on,  the  question  of  messianic   ^igiiclaism  as  a  branch  of  Judaism  will  have  to-,-,   be  considered.   What  impart  do  you  believe  Mel  Gibson’s  film,  The  Passion  of  the  Christ,  has  bad  on  popular  perceptions  of  die  crucifixion  and  on   JewisbChristian  relations?   When  Gibson’s  script  first  surfaced,  I  was  on  a  scholars’  committee  con  vened  in  part  by  the  US  Conference  of  Catholic  Bishops  to  review  it.  My  own  sense  of  the  movie  was,  “Thank  God  it  wasn’t  the  [original]  script,  which  was  a  whole  lot  more  anti-Jewish.”  The  film  didn’t  give  rise  to  any  extreme  anti-Jewish  sentiment  but  encouraged  Jews  and  Christians  to  talk  to  each  other.  It  helped  Jews  and  Christians  to  see  why  they  per  ceive  things  so  differently.   Are  you  involved  in  interfaith  work  and  does  the  United  States  have  the  equivalent  of  Australia’s  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews?   I  am  and  we  do.  The  CCJ  isn’t  as  strong  in  the  US  as  in  Europe,  Australia  or  Latin  America,  but  there  are  a  number  of  groups  locally  and  for  reli  gious  professionals.   How  do  you  view  messianic  Judaism  and  Jews  for  Jesus?   The  thing  that  concerns  me  the  most  about  these  groups  is  that  they  split  up  families  -  parents  don’t  know  how  to  relate  to  their  children  who  express  faith  in  Jesus.  Sometimes  children  of  these  marriages  will  say  to  their  grandparents,  “Gee,  bobba  and  zaide,  it’s  too  bad  you’re  going  to  hell.”  I  also  worry  about  who  has  the  right  to  say  who  is  a  Jew.  A  number  of  messianic  Jews  are  halachically  observant,  so  the  question  of  mes  sianic  Judaism  as  a  branch  of  Judaism  will  have  to  be  considered.  It’s  often  easier  when  someone  says  they’re  no  longer  a  Jew  but  a  Lutheran  or  Presbyterian,  but  what  happens  when  someone  wants  to  hang  on  to   their  Jewish  identity?  It’s  not  just  an  intellectual  problem  and  I   aon  t  want  to  leave  out  tne  personal  quesuons.   What  interesting  comments  have  Jewish  Mends  made  about  your  work  teaching  Christian  divinity?   I’ve  frequently  been  asked:  “What’s  a  nice  Jewish  girl  like  you  doing  in  a  job  like  this?""  I  explain  Judaism  to  people  in  the  church  and  Christianity  to  people  in  the   synagogue.   What’s  your  view  of  last  year’s  novel,  The  Gospel  According  to  Judas,  co-written  by  Australian  priest   Father  Frank  Moloney  and  author  Jeffrey  Archer,   which  gave  a  very  different  perspective  on   Judas  to  the  treacherous  figure  com   monly  depicted?   I  know  Father  Moloney  ...  an  interna  tional  star  and  great  treasure.  There  were  a  number  of  books  on  Judas  coming  out  at  the  time.  From  Hollywood  to  academia,  the  idea  of  redoing  Judas  isn’t  terribly  new.  How  are  we  reading  into  Judas?  When  looking  at  the  story  from  the  earliest   to  the  later  gospels,  we  see  an  increasing  vilification  of  his   character.

"  The  infamous  blood  libel  resurfaces   SICHAT  YOSEF   YDSSIARON   TTie  Aga  report  specified  that  the  views  of  al  Manar  are  ""viciously  anti-Semitic  -   perpetuating  the   medieval  blood  libel  that  Jews  use  the  blood  of   Christian  children  in  their  Passover  meals  [sic]”.   ASSUME  that  I  was  not  the  only  person  to  be  stunned  when  pick  ing  up  The  Age  on  Thursday,  August  21.  In  2008,  the  infamous   blood  libel  had  made  its  way  to  the  front  page  of  that  Australian  daily   newspaper.   The  Age  story  reported  that  Aus  tralian  authorities  are  trying  to  stop  anti-Semitic  satellite  television  station   al-Manar  broadcasting  into  Australia   from  Indonesia.  Hezbollah-funded   al-Manar  promotes  and  raises  money  for  terrorism.  And  contrary  to  the  oft  suggested  “distinction”  between  anti   Zionism  and  anti-Semitism  that  is  heard  from  time  to  time  from  certain   quarters,  the  station  has  shown  the  true  colours  of  our  enemies,  who  utilise  as  part  of  their  “anti-Zionist”  propaganda  the  myth  that  has  caused  death  and  suffering  to  Jews  through  out  the  European  Diaspora  since  the  12th  century  (and  even  had  earlier  antecedents  dating  back  to  Grecian  times).  The  Age  report  specified  that  the  views  of  al-Manar  are  “viciously  anti-Semitic  -  perpetuating  the  medieval  blood  libel  that  Jews  use  the  blood  of  Christian  children  in  their  Passover  meals  [sic]”.   Writing  in  2006,  historian  Walter  Lacqueur  recorded:  “Altogether,  there   have  been  about  150  recorded  cases  of  blood  libel  (not  to  mention  thou  sands  of  rumours)  that  resulted  in  the  arrest  and  killing  of  Jews  throughout  history,  most  of  them  in  the  Middle  Ages.  In  almost  every  case,  Jews  were  murdered,  sometimes  by  a  mob,  sometimes  following  torture  and  a   ‘trial’.”   The  basis  of  the  blood  libel  levelled   against  Jews  over  the  centuries  was   the  accusation  that  the  blood  of  a  Christian  child  is  an  essential  ingredi  ent  for  the  making  of  matzot.  No   matter  that,  to  Jews,  murder  is  a  car  dinal  sin,  while  Jewish  law  strenu  ously  forbids  the  consumption  of   blood  from  even  a  kosher  animal.  Many  a  pogrom  resulted  from  incite  ment  to  mobs  based  on  events  rang  ing  from  the  inexplicable  absence  of  an  apparently  missing  child  to  the  deliberate  kidnapping  and  even  mur  der  of  such  a  child  by  persons  willing   to  sacrifice  one  of  their  own  to  achieve  attacks  on  Jews.   Why  was  such  a  suggestion  even  believed?  Perhaps  reference  during  the  seder  to  the  plague  of  blood  com  bined  with  the  preference  for  red  wine  for  the  four  cups  appeared  to  give  the  ignorant  or  malevolent  a  basis  of  their  accusations.  Perhaps  also  the  Christian  use  of  wafers  and   wine  as  part  of  ceremonies  in  the  church  associated  with  the  Last  Sup  per  tended  to  give  the  ignorant  or  those  who  hated  us  additional  point   ers  in  this  direction.   But  whatever  their  underlying  cause,  libel-based  events  have  charac  terised  centuries  of  Jewish  history.  William  of  Norwich,  England,  was   found  dead  with  stab  wounds  in  1144   and  acquired  the  status  of  a  martyr.  A  generation  later,  the  Jews  of  London   and  York  were  massacred  and  almost   all  Norwich  Jews  slaughtered  in  their  homes.  In  1290,  Jews  were  expelled  from  England.  Across  the  channel,   similar  accusations  wrecked  havoc  on  the  communities  in  Blois,  France,  and  Alsace,  Baden  and  Switzerland.  Over  ensuing  centuries,  the  accusation  spread  across  Europe,  causing  suffer  ing  in  Austria,  Italy,  Hungary,  Poland  and  Lithuania.  In  the  20th  century,  Mendel  Beilis,  a  Jewish  factory  man  ager  in  Kiev,  was  accused  of  murder  ing  a  Christian  child  and  using  his  blood  for  baking  matzot.  His  sensa   1   A  plaque  on  the  wall  of  the  Hermitage  of  the  Holy  Child  In  La  Guardia,  Spain,   depicting  a  local  legend  based  on  an  anti-Semitic  blood  libel.

Julius  Streicher’s  infamous  anti  Semitic  paper,  Der  Stuermer,  repeat  edly  featured  ritual  murder  as  fact.  The  1946  Kielce  pogrom  against  Holocaust  survivors  in  Poland  was   also  sparked  by  an  accusation  of   blood  libel.   For  centuries,  Jews  in  the  lands  of  Islam,  albeit  often  relegated  to  sec  ond-class  citizen  status,  were  compar  atively  free  of  the  scourge.  However,   1840  saw  the  accusations  and  their   implications  spread  beyond  Christian  Europe.  The  Damascus  affair  that  fol  lowed  the  disappearance  of  a  Francis  can  friar  resulted  in  pogroms  spreading  across  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa.  In  recent  years,  that  story  has  been  given  wide  credence  by  publications  emanating  from  Syria,  including  a  book  written  by  a  Syrian   minister  of  defence.   In  2002,  an  academic  at  Saudi  Ara   bia’s  King  Faysal  University  published  an  article  with  a  twist  to  the  old  story,  alleging  that  the  blood  of  teenagers  is  used  in  preparing  “special  pastries  for  the  festival  of  Purim”,  referring  to   hamantaschen.   The  activities  of  al-Manar  show  that  the  blood  libel  has  now  been   adopted  by  Hezbollah  as  part  of  their  anti-Zionist  propaganda  circulated   worldwide.  Whether  or  not  Aus  tralian  authorities  can  do  anything  about  it  is  a  moot  question.  Whatever  the  outcome,  Jews  need  to  be  on  guard  against  vicious  propaganda  that  regrettably  does  capture  minds  and  hearts  in  a  way  that  influences  those  who  we  must  deal  with  to  achieve  and  maintain  peace  in  the   Middle  East   Shabbat  shalom,  Yossi   Yossi  Aron  is  the  AJNs  religious  affairs  editor.

"  'The  Israeli-Arab  dilemma   ANALYSIS   CAROLINE  GUCK   JERUSALEM  -  Last  Thursday,  a  28  year-old  Israel  Defence  Forces  (IDF)  non-commissioned  officer  was  killed   along  the  border  with  Gaza  by  a  roadside  bomb.  A  Bedouin  from  the  south,  he  served  as  a  combat  tracker.  At  his  funeral,  his  cousin  said,  “He  did  everything  he  could  to  convince  [Bedouin]  youth  to  enlist  in  the  army   to  serve  the  state.  He  said  his  service  was  hard,  but  he  chose  to  defend  his  country.”  Another  cousin  noted  that  almost  all  the  men  in  their  family   serve  in  the  IDF.   At  his  family’s  request,  his  name  was  not  released  to  the  public.  He  was  buried  in  a  non-military  funeral.   The  family’s  request  stemmed  from  fear  that  the  Israeli  Arab  leader  ship  or  terrorists  from  the  Palestinian  Authority  would  take  revenge  on  its  members  for  their  service  to  the  State  of  Israel.  Their  fear  of  violent  attack  outweighed  their  desire  to  have  their  hero  receive  the  public  honours  he  so  richly  deserved  for  sacrificing  his  life  for  his  country.   Contrast  the  fortunes  of  this   family  to  those  of  an  Arab  family  in  Jerusalem  who  also  lost  a  son  last  Thursday.   Last  Friday,  hundreds  visited  a  tra  ditional  Muslim  mourning  tent  in  Jerusalem’s  Jabel  Mukaber  neigh  bourhood  to  pay  their  respects  to  the  family.  The  tent  was  adorned  by  hun  dreds  of  posters  of  the  dead  man’s   An  unrecognised  Bedouin  village  of  6000  residents  In  the  Negev,  which  lacks   electricity,  running  water,  paved  roads  or  other  basic  Infrastructure.  Photo:  JTA   face.  It  was  also  decorated  with  Hezbollah  and  Hamas  banners.   The  tent  was  erected  to  honour  Ala  Abu  Dhaim,  the  man  who  massa  cred  eight  boys  and  young  men  as  they  studied  Torah  at  Yeshivat  Merkaz  Harav.  Dhaim’s  family  did  not  fear  retribution  from  their  fellow  Arabs.  His  neighbours  did  not  demonstrate  against  his  crime.   What  is  going  on  in  Israeli  Arab  society  -  which  comprises  20  per  cent  of  Israel’s  population?  The  radi  calisation  of  the  Israeli  Arab  commu  nity  has  been  observed  over  the  years,  but  former  foreign  and  defense  min  ister  Moshe  Arens  warns  that  it  is   wrong  to  view  Israeli  Arabs  as  a  monolithic  block.  Indeed,  they  are  an  ethnically  and  religiously  diverse  population.   The  current  situation,  in  which  Israeli  Arab   heroes  fear  attack  and  Israeli  Arab  traitors  are   extolled  must  be  turned  on  its  head.   To  start  with,  Israel’s  100,000  Druse,  who  accepted  compulsory  military  service  for  their  young  men  in  1949,  are  integrated  in  Israeli  society.  Indeed,  the  rate  of  Druse  mil  itary  service  is  higher  than  it  is  among  Jews.   The  Circassians  also  accepted  obligatory  military  service  for  their  sons  and  they  too  are  integrated  into  Israeli  society.   Then  there  are  the  Israeli  Bedouin.  Although  Bedouin  are  Muslims,  due  to  their  unique  cultural  traditions,  Bedouin  have  historically  perceived  themselves  as  distinct  from  the  other  Arab  Muslims  in  Israel,  but  are  moving  ever  closer  to  the  Pales  tinian  Arabs  and  away  from  their  Israeli  identity.  Numbering  200,000,   Hamas,  Hezbollah  and  PLO  flags  hang   outside  the  East  Jerusalem  house  of  the  gunman  who  killed  eight  people  at  the  Yeshlvat  Merkaz  Harav  In  Jerusalem.   Photo:  Flash  90   Bedouin  comprise  some  25  per  cent  of  Israel’s  Muslim  population.   Then  there  are  the  Christian   Arabs.  Israel’s  Christian  Arab  popu  lation  is  the  only  flourishing  Chris  tian  community  in  the  Middle  East.  Christians  find  themselves  under  assault  by  authorities  and  Islamic  gangs  across  the  Middle  East,  but  in  Israel,  the  Christian  population  has  grown  steadily  in  recent  years.   Finally  there  are  the  Israeli  Arab  Muslims.  Since  the  1994  establish   ment  of  the  Palestinian  Authority,  the  Israeli  Muslim  leadership  has  been  radicalised.  Many  of  their  leaders  and  organisations  have  worked  steadily  to  undermine  the  Israeli  Arab  Muslims’  sense  of  attachment  to  the  State  of   Israel  and  to  intimidate  dissenting   voices  into  silence.   Arens  believes  the  natural  pull  of  Israeli  Arabs  is  towards  the  Pales  tinians.  To  stem  the  tide,  Israel  must  launch  a  twin  campaign  to  help  those  Israeli  Arabs  who  support  the  state  and  to  encourage  them  to  intensify  their  integration  into  Israeli  society.  And  it  must  take  concerted  action  against  those  radical  leaders  and  organisations  that  work  to  under  mine  those  bonds.   The  current  situation,  in  which  Israeli  Arab  heroes  fear  attack  and  Israeli  Arab  traitors  are  extolled  must   be  turned  on  its  head.   JPOST.COM ",2008-03-14

"  THE  WHOLE  TRUTH   THE  recent  reports  on  the  tour  to  the  NSW  South  Coast  by  representatives  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  (JBD)  would  have  been  most  disturbing  to  the  reader.  What  actu  ally  transpired  were  “overwhelmingly  positive  and  extremely  warm  meet  ings”  with  Christian  clergy  and  teachers  of  religion,  and  350  school   students.   These  sentiments  were  made   known  to  me  by  JBD  CEO  Vic  Alhad  efif  and  education  manager  Lynda   Ben-Menashe.   I  write  this  because  I’m  well  aware  that  a  noticeable  element  within  the  Jewish  community  would  take  the  reported  account  of  the  tour  as  gospel  (pun  intended),  who  cannot  know  what  rewards  were  indeed  reaped  as  a  result  of  the  visit.   Can  this  community  envisage  that  the  welfare  and  security  of  Jews  could  actually  be  enhanced  by  encouraging  engagement  with  people  of  other   faiths?   The  absolutist  and  exclusivist  claim   allegedly  advocated  by  Pastor  Harris  is  an  aberration,  at  odds  with  the  over  whelmingly  constructive  attitude   advanced  by  Christian  churches  today.   In  Victoria,  the  Baptist  commu  nity  represents  a  broadly  accepting  view  in  its  relationship  with  other  faith  communities,  and  being  repre  sented  on  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  is  testimony  to  their  interest  in  meaningful  dialogue.   It  also  supports  the  WellSpring  Centre,  which  runs  the  highly  acclaimed  Building  Bridges,  a  pro  gram  designed  to  promote  respect  and  understanding  between  students  at  different  faith  schools.  The  recently  concluded  program  featured  as  many  as  17  schools,  including  two  Jewish   ones.   Let’s  not  adhere  to  John  Lennon’s  mantra:  “Imagine  there’s  no  religion  too.”  We  all  have  the  opportunity  pre  sented  to  us  to  engage  with  others;  let’s  respond  sensibly,  and  not  be  diverted  by  pastors  out  on  a  limb.

"  PROUD  FRIEND  OF  ISRAEL   LAST  weekend,  a  Jewish  friend  of  mine  asked  me  to  read  the  article  and   related  editorial  in  your  newspaper,  which  related  to  comments  made  by  an  independent  Baptist  pastor  (AJN  21/11).   I  was  saddened  to  read  of  his   approach,  and  wanted  to  write  to  say  that  not  all  independent  Baptist  con  gregants  share  it.   In  my  Old  Testament  scriptures,  I  read  the  promise  that  G-d  made  to   Abram,  “I  will  bless  those  who  bless  you,  and  I  will  curse  him  who  curses  you,  and  in  you  all  the  families  of  the  earth  shall  be  blessed”  (Genesis  12:3).  I  know  that  no  verse  in  either  the  Old  or  New  Testaments  shows  that  G-d  has  ever  changed  His  mind  or  gone  back  on  His  promises  to  the  nation  of  Israel.   I  read  in  Psalm  122:6  the  instruc  tion  to  “pray  for  the  peace  of  Jerusalem”,  and  I,  along  with  many  in  my  church,  believe  this  instruction  applies  to  me  today  in  2008.   Further,  in  my  New  Testament,  I  read  the  instruction  that  Christian  believers  are  to  “give  no  offence,  either  to  the  Jews  or  to  the  Greeks  or  to  the  church  of  G-d”  (1  Corinthians  10:32).  Look  in  that  verse  and  see  who  gets  first  place  even  in  the  New  Testa  ment  -  the  precious  Jewish  people!   I  am  proud  to  be  a  friend  of  Israel  and  the  Jewish  people.   I  am  a  folk  dance  teacher,  teaching  in  local  public  schools,  and  Israeli  dance  is  always  a  part  of  my  programs.   My  daughter  is  a  klezmer  musi  cian,  and  we  enjoy  so  much  of  Israeli   customs  and  culture.   I  just  wanted  to  write  and  say  that  as  a  Christian,  I  bless  the  Jewish  people!   JEANETTE  mGLLEN  HAUER   Mt  Riverview,  NSW ",2008-12-05
"  PASSIONATE  CONTROVERSY   I  FIND  it  galling  that  the  Catholic  Church  continues  to  use  the  “Pas   sion”  play  to  this  day,  knowing  full   well  that  it  is  a  fictitious  anti-Semitic   diatribe  designed  to  instil  hatred  towards  Jews  who  gave  the  world  the  concept  of  the  Messiah.  In  fact,  when  the  Messiah  arrives,  there  is  supposed  to  be  peace  on  earth.  As  there  has  been  no  peace  for  more  than  2000  years,  the  Christian  church  conve  niently  developed  the  concept  of  the  Second  Coming.   •  According  to  the  writings  of  the  noted  Roman  historian  Josephus,  there  was  never  any  custom  to  pardon  anyone  at  Pesach  scheduled  for  cruci  fixion.  The  story  about  Pontius  Pilate  and  the  hand-washing  scene  putting  the  blame  on  Jews  was  designed  by  the   Church  to  instil  hatred  towards  them.   The  New  Testament  states  that  Christ’s  followers  appealed  to  the  Romans  to  have  him  brought  down  for  burial  before  Shabbat,  but  to  make  sure  he  was  dead,  “the  centurion  speared  him  in  the  side  and  out  gushed  blood  and  water”.  The  inter  esting  word  here  is  “gushed”.  This  implies  the  heart  is  pumping.  If  this  is  so,  the  individual  is  alive.  So  much  for  the  concept  of  the  resurrection.   Christian  clergy  often  quote  the  psalms,  which  were  written  before  the  birth  of  Christianity  and  all  references   to  the  Lord  were  to  the  God  of  Israel   and  have  nothing  whatsoever  to  do  with  Jesus.

"  Separating  church   (synagogue)  and  state   ANECDOTAL  EVIDENCE   SIDRA  KRANZ  MOSHINSKY   The  Lord's  Prayer  is  recited  each  day  before  federal   Parliament  sits  and  has  been  since  1901.  But  does  that  make  it  right?   T  home  I  have  a  booklet   modest  in  appearance  but  quite  grand  in  purpose  enti  tled  Australian  Jewry  Book  of   Honour:  The  Great  War  1914-1918.  Published  in  1923  and  dedicated  to  Lieutenant  General  Sir  John  Monash,  it  records  the  significant  and  dispro  portionate  contribution  made  by  Australian  Jewish  servicemen  and  women.  The  names  of  more  than   2000  individuals  are  listed  (approxi  mately  13  per  cent  of  the  Jewish  pop  ulation  at  the  time),  as  are  the  names  of  those  who  lost  their  lives.  An  equiv  alent  publication  was  produced  fol  lowing  World  War  II.   In  the  Australian  memorialisation   of  “our  glorious  dead”,  the  fact  that  there  were  many  Jewish  soldiers  who  fought  and  died  is  often  overlooked.  Many  memorials  around  Australia  contain  Christian  iconography  as  part  of  their  design.  In  Perth,  so  cen  tral  is  the  cross  to  the  imposing  memorial  at  Kings  Park  that  the  Jew  ish  community  felt  compelled  to  erect  its  own  memorial  to  Jewish  soldiers  just  a  few  metres  away.  In  2005,  the  Australian  mint  produced  a  coin  enti  tled  “Remembrance”  to  commemo  rate  the  60th  anniversary  of  the  ending  of  World  War  n.  It  features  a  simple-looking  military  cemetery  with  a  priest,  a  scattering  of  soldiers  and  three  crosses  marking  the  graves.  That  some  soldiers  were  buried  with  a  Magen  David  above  them  is  not  recognised  here.   On  one  hand,  it  can  be  argued  that  it  is  unreasonable  to  demand  this  kind  of  gesture  on  a  national  coin.  While  the  Jewish  community  can  and  should  feel  proud  of  its  contribution  to  Australia’s  military,  our  thousands  are  but  a  fraction  of  the  whole.   On  the  other  hand,  it  is  important  that  voices  of  objection  be  raised  to  the  too  easy  omission  of  minority  his  tory,  rights  and  status.  Earlier  incar   nations  of  the  Jewish  community  fought  hard  for  land  to  be  granted  to  synagogues  (after  it  was  granted  to  churches),  for  sections  of  cemeteries  to  be  dedicated  to  the  “Israelite”  faith  (after  they  were  granted  to  Christian  dominations),  and  for  funding  for  Jewish  state  schools  (which  did  exist  for  a  short  time).   But  the  Lord’s  Prayer  in  Parliament  is  different.   Federal  Parliament  is  an  intensely  symbolic  place  and  its  mode  of  operation  should   embody  the  spirit  of  Australia  -  equality,  fairness,  justice,  democracy.   These  battles  do  not  belong  only  to  the  19th,  or  even  die  20th  cen  turies.  The  need  to  fight  them  endures.  The  scheduling  of  the  Rudd  government’s  2020  Summit  is  a  case  in  point,  falling  on  first  day  Pesach.  Although  the  government  did  attempt  to  address  Jewish  concerns  by  establishing  a  Jewish  pre-summit  symposium,  the  “real”  summit  went  ahead  on  one  of  the  most  significant  days  in  the  Jewish  calendar.  Ids  incon   ceivable  that  the  event  would  have   clashed  with  a  major  Christian  holy  day.   The  Australian  Constitution  man   dates  that  religion  and  state  be  kept  separate:  “The  Commonwealth  shall  not  make  any  law  for  establishing  any  religion,  or  for  imposing  any  religious  observance  ...”  Yet,  unlike  in  the  US,  some  religious  observance  in  public  life  is  not  viewed  as  incompatible   with  the  wording  of  the  Constitution  (although  one  could  argue  a  different  case  with  respect  to  its  spirit).   The  question  of  how  far  the  gov  ernment  should  favour  one  religion  over  another  has  emerged  as  an  issue  in  recent  weeks  with  the  Speaker  of  the  House  of  Representatives,  Harry  Jenkins,  calling  for  a  public  debate  on  whether  the  Lord’s  Prayer  should  continue  to  be  recited  at  the  begin  ning  of  each  day  of  Parliament.  Apparently,  this  has  been  the  practice  since  1901,  so  it  certainly  has  a  long  tradition,  but  I  must  admit  it  came  as  news  to  me.  And  a  shock.   It’s  really  a  matter  of  where  to  draw  the  line.  Being  a  member  of  a  minority  religion  means  that  there   will  be  occasions  when  the  “domi  nant”  religion  is  just  that:  dominant.  It  doesn’t  really  bother  me  if  my  local  council  uses  some  of  my  rates  for  Christmas  decorations  and  carols  in   the  park  (though  seeing  the  odd  chanukiah  on  top  of  a  light  post  does  make  me  feel  good);  I  accept  that  major  Christian  holy  days  are  public  holidays,  and  I  must  admit  that  I  used  to  enjoy  the  quiet  streets  on  a  Sunday  before  the  religion  of  consumerism  eclipsed  any  notion  of  a  day  of  rest   But  the  Lord’s  Prayer  in  Parlia  ment  is  different  Federal  Parliament  is  an  intensely  symbolic  place  and  its  mode  of  operation  should  embody  the  spirit  of  Australia  -  equality,  fair  ness,  justice,  democracy.  The  recita  tion  of  the  Lord’s  Prayer  has  no  place  there.  It  creates  a  difficult  situation  for  Jewish  members  of  parliament  (if  we  had  a  Jewish  speaker,  he  or  she  would  presumably  have  to  lead  the  prayer)  and  it  sends  a  symbolic  message  to  the  Australian  public  that  what  suits  the  majority  can  stand  for  the  whole.   It  is  important  that  members  of  Parliament  be  reminded  each  morn   ing  of  the  gravity  of  what  they  do  and  the  enormity  of  their  task.  Yet  it’s  time  for  new  words  to  be  written  to  replace  those  of  the  New  Testament  in  giving  expression  to  these  sentiments.

Christian  Karembeu,  l'un  des  plus  prestigieux  «  palmarès  »  du  football  tricolore  -  il  aura  porté  cinquante-trois  fois  le  maillot  des  «  Bleus  »  -  méritait  bien  de  se  voir  ainsi  comme  «  sacralisé  »  chez  les  «  siens  »  non  seulement  par  tout  un  pays  mais  aussi  par  ses  amis   de  l'équipe  de  France  98  venus  en  la  circonstance  l'entourer  de  leur  fidèle  amitié  avec  en  tête   l'emblématique  entraîneur  Aimé  Jacquet...  tels  un  Zinedine  Zidane,  un  Youri  Djorkaeff  et  autres  Bixente  Lizarazu,  Bernard  Lama,  Franck  Leboeuf,  Laurent  Blanc  ou  encore  Robert  Pirès.

En  fait,  un  véritable  spectacle  -  ouvert  aux  rythmes  de  danses  pluriethniques  de  toute  beauté  puis  porté  sinon  «  transporté  »  par  les  accents  sublimes  de  l'Hymne  à  la  Joie  -  en  somme,  du  Beethoven  à  l'heure  du  pilou...  il  fallait  l'oser  -  dans  un  stade  rénové  flambant  neuf  et  tout  en  folie  où,  finalement,  l'émotion  l'aura  disputé  à  la  ...  jubilation.

Tandis  que,  par  milliers,  les  «  déçus  »  de  ne  pouvoir  pénétrer  dans  un  stade  archicomble  et  pris  d'assaut,  vivaient  ce  moment  magique  avec  une  même  passion  devant  leurs  écrans  géants  de  télévision.  Le  tout  «  éclatant  »,  nuit  tombée,  dans  un  crépitant  feu  d'artifice  venant  apporter  une  touche  finale  aux  multiples  et  interminables  «Olà»  ébranlant  tour  à  tour  chaque  tribune...  Réussi.  Enchanteur.  Du  jamais  vu.  Mais  il  faut  dire  qu'en  l'ami  Karembeu  dont  un  poster  géant  habillait  l'Hôtel  de  la  Province  même  pendant  huit  jours  -  la  foule  saluait  aussi  dans  une  ambiance  plus  que  festive  l'homme  généreux,  toujours  disponible,  qui  s'est  notamment  lancé  avec  l'OMS  dans  la  lutte  contre  le  sida  alors  qu'il  jouait  à  Genève...  car  il  aura  également  connu  avec  brio  les  stades  suisses  comme  aussi,  du  reste,  anglais.  On  sait  encore,  par  exemple,  qu'il,  est  parti  en  2005  avec  l'UNESCO  installer  au  Togo   un  programme  d'alphabétisation  et  qu'il  s'est  récemment  aussi  impliqué  dans  une  association  d'aide  aux  enfants  handicapés.  Cependant,  le  joueur  calédonien  joue  surtout  désormais  un  rôle  éminent  dans  le  football  océanien  :  la  FIFA  lui  a  en  effet  confié,  en  le  nommant  son  «  ambassadeur  »  pour  la  région,  la  mission  de  promouvoir  le  «  ballon  rond  »  dans  cette  Océanie  où  domine  plutôt  le  rugby  et  notamment  dans  les  écoles  «  parce  que  le  football  est  un  outil  d'éducation  et  d'insertion  sociale».  Grâce  à  lui,  d'ailleurs  -  et  donc  à  ce  jubilé  -  Nouméa  est  devenue  un  temps  la  «capitale  régionale  »  du  football  car  ce  n'est  pas  sans  raison  qu'y  sont  venus  -  outre  le  président  international  suisse  Steph  Blatzer  -  tout  naturellement  le  président  tahitien  de  la  Confédération  Océanienne  Reynald  Temarii  et  surtout,  de  manière  plus  inattendue,  en  avion  privé,  le  président  de  la  fédération  australienne  Franck  Lowy  dont  on  sait  qu'il  est  venu  défendre  ici  -  à  l'heure  où,  dans  la  région,  avec  un  président  de  langue  francophone,  les  territoires  français  du  Pacifique  ont  évidemment  leur  mot  à  dire  -  la  candidature  de  son  pays  pour  l'organisation  de  la  Coupe  du  Monde  2018.  Toujours  est-il  que  le  Stade  Numa  Daly  aura  éteint  ses  feux  sur  les  remerciements  émouvants  de  Christian  Karembeu  rendant  hommage  à  la  foule  bien  sûr,  mais  aussi  à  ses  anciens,  ses  parents,  ses  proches,  qui  lui  auront  permis  d'être  ce  qu'il  est  devenu...  et,  finalement,  y  associant  tout  le  monde,  à  la  Nouvelle-Calédonie  entière.

"  Responding  to  God's  call  theme  for  Sisters  of  Mary   A  Diocesan  Conference  for  the  Sisters  of  St  Mary  was  held  at  Badu  Island  over  two  days  earlier  this  month  at  the  St.  Mark's  IME  Parish  Hall,  concluding  with  a  Thanksgiving  Service  followed  by  feasting  and  island  dancing.  The  Sisters  of  St.  Mary  is  a  women's  organisation  within  the  Diocese  of  the  Independent  Christian  Church  in  Torres  Strait  and  Kaiwalagal,  Australia  Inc.  (United  Anglican  Communion).  The  first  Branch  was  formed  on  April  10,  2006,  at  Waibene's  Parish  of  the  Resurrection  and  in  total  has  Branches  in  eight  of  its  15  Parishes  in  Torres  Strait,  Kaiwalagal,  NPA  and  mainland  Australia.  The  vision  of  the  Sisters  of  St  Mary   is  to  nurture  the  Christian  family  life.  Its  purpose  is  to  be  specially  concerned  with  all  that  strengthens  and  preserves  marriage  and  Christian  relationship.  The  theme  of  the  conference  was  ""God  Calls  Us  to  Respond'.  The  first  day  of  brainstorming  produced  many  positive  topics  in  response  to  the  question  ""How  are  we  going  to  respond  to  God's  Call?"".  The  topics  will  form  the  basis  from  which  the  roles  and  responsibilities  and  code  of  conduct  will  be  developed.  Election  of  Diocesan  Office  Bearers  were  held  on  the  afternoon  of  the  second  day  of  the  conference.  From  the  36  members  present  the  following  Diocesan  Office  Bearers  were  elected.  Diocesan  President,  Mrs  Denna  Nona   (also  President  of  Badu  Branch);  Diocesan  Vice-President,  Mrs  Betty  Sagigi  (also  President  of  Waibene  Branch  and  Diocesan  Registrar);  Diocesan  Secretary,  Mrs  Alana  Enosa  (Warraber  Branch);  Diocesan  Treasurer,  Mrs  Ethel  Millett  (also  Vice-President  of  Waibene  Branch).  The  newly  elected  Diocesan  Committee  were  then  commissioned  into  office  by  the  Sisters  of  St.  Mary  Chaplain  and  St.  Mark's  Parish  Priest,  Father  John  Eseli,  at  the  Thanksgiving  service  on  Sunday  morning  at  St.  Mark's  Pro-Cathedral.  As  this  was  the  first  Diocesan  Conference  since  the  formation  of  the  Sisters  of  St  Maiy,  many  older  members  who  had  been  former  members  of  the  Anglican  Mother's  Union,  felt  obliged  to  share  their  experiences  with  the  younger  members  who  were  present  and  who  welcomed  the  advice.   At  times  it  was  very  emotional  as  former  members  were  remembered  for  their  contribution  and  who  were  now  not  present  having  passed  away  in  the  last  couple  of  years  and  the  fact  that  this  was  a  new  phase  bringing  the  organisation  up  to  the  Diocesan  level.  It  would  not  have  been  a  success  but  for  the  contribution  of  many.  A  big  thank  you  must  to  go  the  Parish  of  St  Mark,  Badu,  for  launching  the  First  Diocesan  Conference  for  the  Sisters  of  St  Mary.  Also  to  Archdeacon  Father  Imasu  Aragu  for  his  presence,  the  Sisters  of  St  Mary  Chaplain,  Father  John  Eseli,  St  Mark  Parish  Council,  Sisters  of  St  Mary  of  Badu  and  families  who  kindly  offered  their  homes  to  billet  visiting  members  especially  Ama  Blanket  and  family,  Mrs  Annie  Ishmail  and  family,  Father  and  Ama  Eseli  and  family,  St.  Mark  Parish,  Mr  and   Mrs  Albert  Warria  and  family  and  Ms  Teleai  Ahmat  and  Mr  Harry  Newie  and  family.

Last,  but  not  least,  a  special  thanks  to  St  Mark  Parish's  Youth  of  St.  Andrew  who  catered  for  the  mothers  and  members  and  for  the  gifts  offered  after  Sunday  Mass.  Many  friendships  were  formed  and  old  ones  renewed,  tears  shed  and  promises  made  to  meet  again  at  the  Church's  next  major  event  at  Dauan  Island  in  July,  2008.  Everyone  enjoyed  the  evenings  of  Thursday,  Friday  and  Saturday  as  well  as  Sunday  evening's  entertainment.

"  Two  chosen  to  play  in  new  Under  18  competition   Two  of  Abergowrie  College's  most-promis-  ing  young  rugby  league  players,  Dale  Murphy  and  Josiah  Geia,  have  been  selected  in  the  Townsville  Under  18  squad  for  2009.  The  team  will  play  in  an  eigh-week  QRL   competition  in  2009  with  teams  selected  from  Cairns,  Mackay,  Wide  Bay,  Rockhampton  and  the  Northern  Territory.  Following  those  rounds  the  team  at  the  head  of  the  competi-  tion  will  compete  in  a  National  Final.  The  squad  will  be  coached  by  Cowboys  Under  20s  coach,  Grant  Bell,  and  will  be  an  opportunity  for  the  selected  players  to  play  at  a  higher  level  than  their  local  competi-  tion.  Running  alongside  the  Queensland  Cup  competition,  the  games  will  also  give  the  players  opportunities  to  come  under  the  scrutiny  of  other  selectors.  Speaking  about  his  selection,  Dale  Murphy  could  hardly  wipe  the  smile  from  his  face.  ""I  am  so  very  excited  and  happy  at  making  the  squad,""  he  said.  ""Again  it  shows  that  hard  work  and  taking  opportunities  that  are  offered  re-  ally  does  pay  off.""  And  Dale,  grandson  of  Cyril  Seden,  really  does  know  what  taking  opportuni-  ties  means.  A  permanent  member  of  the  2008  Gowrie  Firsts,  Dale  would  have  been  a  certain  selection  to  play  at  Confraternity  Shield  this  year,  the  dream  of  any  budding  Rugby  League  player.  But  another  opportu-  nity  came  his  way.  Dale  chose  to  forgo  playing  at  the  Confraternity  level,  and  instead  went  with  his  Church  group  to  Kenya  to  help  with  a  food  and  rebuilding  program  at  an  orphanage.

"  UNFAIR  ATTACK   THE  idea  of  changing  one  s  sexuality  seems  to  provoke  a  disproportionate  amount  of  ire.  We  happily  accept  that  people  can  stop  being  overeaters,  compulsive  gamblers,  drug  addicts,   and  so  on.  We  have  entire  industries   built  on  self-help  and  self-improve  ment,  which  are  grounded  in  the  premise  that  personalities  and  behav  iour  patterns  can  be  radically  altered.  And  yet  the  idea  that  a  man  can  change  his  same-sex  attractions  and  be  relieved  of  the  urge  to  act  on  these  has  drawn  inexplicable  vehemence.   To  be  sure,  all  of  gay  activism  is  built  on  the  premise  that  homosexu  ality  is  congenital  and  immutable,  so  the  suggestion  that  any  man  has  man  aged  to  change  his  orientation  is  a  grave  threat  to  their  whole  enterprise.  What’s  surprising  is  when  we  are  attacked  by  an  “ally”  of  sorts.   David  Benkof  is  a  Jew  who  used  to  be  a  practising  homosexual  before  doing  teshuvah  and  relinquishing  sex  with  men.  So  far,  so  good.  For  reasons  not  entirely  clear,  Benkof  chose  to  attack  Jews  Offering  New  Alternatives  to  Homosexuality  (JONAH)  in  a  hateful  and  slanderous  diatribe  (AJN  29/08).  Benkof  basically  accuses  JONAH  of  being  a  Christian  front  group.  This  piece  of  nonsense  can  be  disposed  of  by  any  of  the  hundreds  of  Orthodox  JONAH  members.  Yes,  JONAH  draws  upon  therapeutic  techniques  that  have  proven  effective,  regardless  of  where  they  were  devel  oped.  Would  Benkof  refuse  medica  tion  developed  by  an  evangelical   Christian?   As  for  his  challenge  of  the  efficacy  of  the  therapeutic  program  suggested  by  JONAH,  this  is  taken  straight  out  of  the  gay  activist  handbook.  It’s  a  very  simple  formula  consisting  of  (1)  demanding  to  see  the  “success  stories”  (2)  insisting  on  some  unreasonable  definition  of  “success”  (3)  simply  ignoring  the  men  who  have  resolved   most  of  their  issues  and  who  have  become  devoted  husbands  and  loving   fathers.   I  have  been  with  JONAH  for  three  years  and  I  am  now  engaged  to  be  married  (my  future  wife  knows  about  my  issues).  I  thank  Hashem  every  day  for  helping  me  make  this  transition,  and  JONAH  for  giving  me  the  tools.   To  mislead  Jewish  same-sex  attrac  tion  stragglers  about  JONAH  is  tan  tamount  to  placing  stumbling  blocks   before  the  blind.  Isn’t  there  some   thing  about  that  in  the  Torah?   ARTHUR  GOLDBERG   Jersey  City,  US ",2008-09-12

"  CEO  of  the  Canadian  Israel  Committee   Australia  has  been  talking  about  a  free-trade  agreement  (FTA)  with  Israel  for  some  time,  but  it  still  hasi’t  happened.  As  the  man  who  bro  kered  the  free-trade  agreement  between  Canada  and  Israel,  what  steps  have  to  be  taken  to  make  die  agreement  happen?   Like  Canada,  Australia  has  long  appreciated  the  value  of  trade  agree  ments  -  both  as  a  tool  for  expanding  commercial  markets  abroad  as  well  as  a  vehicle  for  strengthening  bilateral  relations  and  enhancing  an  international  profile.  When  we  first  undertook  to  facilitate  an  FTA,  Israel  ranked  47th  among  the  countries  with  which  Canada  was  interested  in  negotiating  such  an  agreement.  What  helped  stimulate  increased  interest  in  Israel  was  a  campaign  to  flag  the  benefits  that  Canada  would  derive  from  an  FTA.  Securing  private  sector  support  was  critical  in  that  process,  so  that  the  government  appreciated  that  it  was  an  initiative  much  broader  than  the  Jewish  community.   Has  the  FTA  changed  Canadaferael  relations  significantly?   The  CanadaJsrael  FTA  has  brought  about  three  important  changes  to  the  relationship.  First,  it  has  greatly  expanded  the  number  of  stake  holders  in  Canada  who  have  an  interest  in  fostering  and  strengthening  the  bilateral  relationship.  In  other  words,  it  is  no  longer  simply  a  parochial  concern  for  the  Jewish  community.  Second,  it  has  brought  increased  prosperity  to  countless  Canadian  and  Israeli  enterprises,  which  serves  as  an  incentive  to  continue  developing  the  trade  relation  ship.  Most  importantly,  however,  it  has  broadened  Canadian  under  standing  of  Israel  and  compelled  significant  numbers  of  Canadians  to  widen  their  “camera  lens”  to  Israel  beyond  the  conflict.   Do  you  support  Canada’s  decision  not  to  attend  Durban  0  and  were  you  involved  in  lobbying  the  government  not  to  attend?   We  were  very  proud  that  our  government  was  the  first  nation  to  announce  its  intention  to  withdraw  support  for  the  so-called  “Durban  II”  conference.  The  decision  was  taken  only  after  it  became  clear  that  the  conference  would  once  again  descend  into  an  anti-Israel  -  and  if  I  may  add,  anti-Semitic  -  feeding  frenzy,  rather  than  a  serious  forum  to   address  the  challenges  of  racism  and  xenophobia.  *  ;r:   Some  people  are  uncomfortable  about  encouraging  religious  Christian  support  for  ted  Why  have  you  focused  on  tins  group  through  the  Christian  Caucus  for  Israel?   In  truth,  the  Christian  Caucus  has  more  traction  in  the  United  States  and  my  efforts  have  been  directed  towards  building  partnerships  with  it  here  in  Canada.  However  as  a  general  proposition,  it  is  my  belief  that  the  support  offered  by  various  Christian  groups  for  Israel  is  genuine,  heartfelt  and  signifi  cantly  broadens  the  scope  of  pro-Israel  support  in  the  Diaspora.   How  do  you  explain  Israel’s  terrible  public  relations  image?   It  is  an  enormous  challenge  to  try  and  con  vince  people  that  it  is  the  (Israeli)  tank  rather  than  the  (Palestinian)  stone-thrower  who  is  the  real  victim.  Video  images  -  both  real  and  choreographed  -  use  a  very  narrow  lens  through  which  we  in  the  West  digest  the  conflict.  Our  efforts  have  to  directed  towards  providing  a  fuller   Jpsraelis  are  yearning  for  a  principled  leader   f  ;  who  has  a  coherent  vision  that  will  lead   them  to  a  greater  sense  of  personal  securiiy.   text  to  the  conflict  and  shifting  some  of  the  attention  to  Israel  “beyond   the  conflict”   What  is  your  Shared  Values  program  about?   In  a  nutshell,  for  most  Canadians  -  and  I  suspect  Australians  -  Israel  is  simply  another  sand-swept,  nomad  tent-dwelling,  primitive  society.  They  neither  relate  to  Israel  nor  feel  any  reason  to  care  about  Israel.  The  Shared  Values  program  is  all  about  providing  them  reasons  to  care:  the  values  of  freedom,  democracy,  social  equality,  freedom  of  reli  gion,  media  and  speech  -  all  the  things  we  cherish...  and  how  Israel  as  a  society  and  Israelis  as  a  people  cherish  them  with  equal  passion.   What  role  does  Jewish  education  play  in  helping  Jews  defend  Israel?  The  importance  of  Jewish  education  is  what  has  brought  me  to  Australia.  I  have  been  at  this  for  more  than  20  years  and  I  have  yet  to  discover  a  more  potent  tool  for  advancing  the  pro-Israel  agenda  than  a  strong,  well  grounded  Jewish  education.  My  .  visit  here  is  primarily  directed  at  pro  moting  and  celebrating  the  valuable  contribution  Bina  has  made  in  the  area  of  connecting  Jews  to  their  rich  heritage  and  timeless  values.   As  a  consultant  to  a  number  of  Israel’s  political  leaders,  who  do  you  see  steering  the  helm  in  the  upcoming  future?   No  true  student  of  politics  would  venture  into  predictions  about  Israeli  politics  and  even  someone  who  has  been  privileged  to  estab  lish  a  close  relationship  with  many  Israeli  leaders  of  various  partisan  affiliations  over  the  years  couldn’t  possibly  predict  where  the  domestic  Israeli  debate  will  go.  What  I  can  say  is  this:  Israelis  are  yearning  for  a  principled  leader  who  has  a  coherent  vision  that  will  lead  them  to  a  greater  sense  of  personal  security.   What  paradigm  did  you  propose  in  your  “Conflict  Management  versus  Conflict  Resolution”  paper  on  the  Middle  East?   Each  peace  process  initiative  to  date  has  tried  to  secure  a  resolution  to  the  conflict  without  first  establishing  a  platform  on  which  to  sustain  it  Expectations  of  what  Israel  must  do  to  secure  peace  are  not  matched  by  a  focus  on  getting  Palestinians  to  a  place  where  they  can  serve  as  true  partners  in  peace.  In  effect,  Palestinians  do  not  see  themselves  as  stake   holders  with  a  vested  interest  in  opting  for  peace  ...  so  when  the   ►eace  process-of-meday  inevitably  collapses,  it  simply  re   enforces  the  bitterness  and  desperation  felt  by  the  Palestinians  and  entrenches  a  rejectionist  perspective.

"  Memoir  of  a  young  refugee’s  nightmare   Book  review   NIGHTMARE'S  FAIRY  TALE:  A  YOUNG   REFUGEE'S  HOME  FRONTS  1938-48   uera  ivorman   University  of  Wisconsin  Press,  $33.95   Reviewed  by  Gael  Hammer   OLOCAUST  child  survivor  Gerd  _  Korman  had  the  great  fortune  to   have  his  brother,  Manfred,  and  both  parents,  Max  and  Rosa,  survive  the   war.   This  book  makes  extensive  use  of  their  whole  wartime  correspondence,  surely  a   unique  Holocaust  archive.  Many  of  the  metic  ulous  footnotes  are  from  personal  letters  and   papers.   Korman,  now  emeritus  professor  of  his  tory  at  Cornell  University,  was  one  of  the  first  to  write  academically  about  the  Holocaust.  His  considerable  contribution  helped  make  it  mainstream  world  history.   Korman  has  both  a  personal  and  an  aca  demic  story  to  tell.  His  family,  observant  Warsaw  Jews,  were  interned  in  a  refugee  camp.  His  father  was  a  passenger  on  the  ill  fated  St  Louis,  the  refugee  ship  escaping  from  the  Nazis  that  was  refused  a  landing  permit  in  Cuba  and  returned  to  Germany.   Thanks  to  their  mother,  the  boys  escaped  on  a  kindertransport  ship,  and  spent  a  year  in  Devon  with  a  kindly  Christian  woman  who  lived  in  Rose  Cottage,  Talaton.  While  Max  sur  vived  the  war  in  Holland’s  notorious   Westerbork  concentration  camp,  Rosa  reached  New  York  where  she  battled  long  and  hard  to  reunite  her  family  there.   In  England,  a  German-speaking  Korman  confronted  new  lifestyles,  languages  and  accents.  For  the  year  in  Devon  the  boys  ate  no  meat  for  reasons  of  kashrut,  such  was  their  commitment  to  Judaism.  Korman,  then  a  teenager,  even  ran  a  seder  with  water  for  wine,  and  matzah  sent  from  London.  Their  mother’s  letters  were  addressed  to  “Miss  Cottage”,  but  were  delivered  anyway  by  the  postman  who,  along  with  the  rest  of  the  small  town,  welcomed  the  refugee   children.   Suddenly  and  incredibly,  in  1940,  the  two  boys  received  tickets  and  visas  to  embark  on  a  risky  sea  voyage  to  New  York.  However,  the  cool  welcome  from  relatives  and  New  York’s  Jewish  community  contrasted  with  the   warmth  of  Christian  country  strangers  in  England.   This  is  an  academic’s  account  of  what  hap  pened  to  his  family  and  the  tension  is  reflected  in  the  book’s  uncomfortable  title.   However,  for  all  the  quality  of  the  writing  I  found  the  book  strangely  cold:  this  historian  deals  in  facts,  not  feelings.   How  did  Max  survive  as  a  Jew  in  Westerbork  for  the  whole  of  the  war?  Korman  implies  that  his  father’s  wartime  survival  cre  ated  egregious  demands  unthinkable  in  peacetime.   Like  every  Holocaust  story,  this  one  is  important  because  of  the  six-and-a-half  mil  lion  stories  that  can  never  be  told.

"  DAVBD  BENKOF,  a  gay  Orthodox  Jew,  who   has  remained  celibate  for  more  than  seven   years,  questions  the  use  of  ‘ex-gay’  terminology.   If  the  Jewish  “ex-gay”  advocates  knew   anything  about  Judaism  and  homosexuality,  they  wouldn't  endorse   Christian  psychoanalytic  ideas,  such  as  ""healing  same-sex  attractions”.   SINCE  2002,  when  I  started   becoming  open  about  my  per  sonal  religious  choice  to  stop  having  same-sex  relations,  liberals  on   gay  issues  have  repeatedly  accused  me  of  being  a  Jewish  “ex-gay”.  But  I  am  no  such  thing,  because  Torah  Judaism  doesn’t  have  a  concept  of  an  “ex-gay”.   I  have  no  doubt  that  some  peo  ple’s  sexualities  change.  I  have  met  many  people  who  say  it  has  hap  pened  to  diem.  But  I’m  sceptical  of  those  who  credit  their  “reorientation”  therapists.  I  just  don’t  see  the  evi   dence  that  it  works.   In  the  process  of  writing  Judaism  and  Homosexuality:  an  Authentic  Orthodox  View,  the  only  significant  full-length  study  of  homosexuality  and  Jewish  law,  Rabbi  Chaim  Rapoport  asked  Jews  Offering  New  Alternatives  to  Homosexuality  (JONAH)  if  he  could  speak  to  some  “success  stories”.  He  was  unsatisfied  with  their  meager  response.   Similarly,  while  I  have  spoken  to  about  two  dozen  JONAH  men  on  the  internet,  phone,  and  in  person,  I  have  never  encountered  a  single  Jew  who  was  gay  (not  bisexual)  and  became  straight  (not  bisexual)  due  to  tech  niques  recommended  by  JONAH.  If  their  approach  was  effective,  shouldn’t  there  be  some  men  and  women  I  could  speak  with  who  say   that  JONAH  did  for  them  what  it  claims  to  be  able  to  do?   Can  prayer  change  one’s  sexuality?  I  don’t  see  why  not  As  an  Orthodox  Jew,  I  certainly  support  people  pray  ing  for  any  change  they  want  —  from  a  new  sexuality  to  more  patience.  If  I  didn’t  believe  God  listens  to  prayers  (although  not  always  responding  like  a  genie),  I  wouldn’t  see  the  point  in  praying  at  all.  And  anyone  struggling  to  bring  his  behaviours  in  line  with  his  values  could  benefit  from  a  good  therapist.   But  that’s  not  the  focus  of  the   “reparative  therapy”  promoted  to  many  Jews  struggling  with  same-sex  attractions.  People  pay  hundreds  of  dollars  to  poseurs  like  Dr  Joseph  Nicolosi,  who  tell  them  their  homo  sexuality  stems  from  problematic  parenting,  but  that  they  can  release  their  inner  heterosexual  through  resolving  trauma  that  exists  only  in  the  therapist’s  imagination,  hyper  masculine  or  hyperfeminine  role  playing,  “gender-appropriate”  activi  ties,  such  as  baseball  and  sewing,  and  other  “muck”  I  don’t  have  the  stom  ach  to  describe.  Even  the  largest  “ex  gay”  group,  Exodus  International,  no  longer  has  much  use  for  Dr  Nicolosi  or  his  discredited  therapy.   If  the  Jewish  “ex-gay”  advocates  knew  anything  about  Judaism  and  homosexuality,  they  wouldn’t   endorse  Christian  psychoanalytic  ideas,  such  as  “healing  same-sex  attractions”,  “becoming  heterosex  ual”  and  the  “false  identity  of  homo  sexuality”.  Their  offer  to  help  gays  “recover  their  heterosexual  poten  tial”  is  clearly  lifted  from  Dr  Nicolosi’s  Catholic  natural-law  phi  losophy.  While  Jewish  law  certainly  calls  for  sexuality  to  be  channeled  into  opposite-sex  relationships,  no  notion  that  we’re  all  inherentiy  straight  appears  in  any  Jewish  text.   The  Torah  knows  no  sexual  orienta  tions  -  which  is  the  point  of  Rabbi  Joel  Beasley’s  important  1998  Jewish  Spectator  article  “Why  Neither  Homosexuality  nor  Heterosexuality  Exist  in  Judaism”.   Many  outspoken  Jewish  support  ers  of  the  “ex-gay”  movement  are  non-observant  Jews.  One  Jewish  woman  who  wanted  to  encourage  me  to  become  “ex-gay”  sent  me  an  email  -  on  Shabbat  -  to  suggest  some  reparative  therapy  websites.  I  wrote  her  back  to  let  her  know  that  (and  I  confirmed  this  with  an  Orthodox  rabbi)  if  she  had  to  violate  one  commandment,  it  would  have  been  better  for  her  to  engage  in  les  bian  sex  than  for  her  to  email  me  on  Shabbat.  She  became  very  hostile.  No  serious  practicing  Jew  would  let  such  people  supervise  their  kosher  meat,  so  why  should  we  trust  them   with  Jews  struggling  with  same-sex   attractions?   JONAH’s  confusion  about  Judaism  and  homosexuality  is  most  evident  in  its  comfort  with  pointing  Jewish  gays  and  lesbians  toward  learning  about  Christian  ideas  about  homosexuality.  For  example,  jonah  web.org  recommends  Homosexual  ity  and  the  Politics  of  Truth  by  Jewish  psychiatrist  Dr  Jeffrey  Satinover.  I  read  that  book  in  2002  when  my  rabbi  told  me  it  was  JONAH  endorsed.  Dr  Satinover  quotes  the  New  Testament  far  more  than  any  Jewish  source.  The  views  of  the  apostle  Paul  appear  on  more  than  a  dozen  pages.  The  executive  vice  president  of  one  organisation  JONAH  has  promoted  used  to  have  a  policy  (until  I  demanded  its  rever  sal)  of  refusing  to  talk  to  any  Jews,  no  matter  how  observant,  unless  he  was  allowed  to  evangelise  them  for  Christ.  Indeed,  I  met  one  young  man  at  a  Jewish  conference  who  confided  in  me  that  he  had  partici  pated  in  many  of  the  “ex-gay”  organisations  promoted  by  JONAH  and  now  accepts  Jesus.   I  would  love  to  see  a  Torah-true   organisation  for  same-sex-attracted  Jews  who,  on  their  own,  seek  help  in  following  Judaism’s  guidelines  for  family  and  bedroom  life.  Alas,  such  an  organisation  does  not  yet  exist ",2008-08-29
"  Baptist  union   censures  minister  for  hellish  stance   CHANTALABUBOL   THE  Baptist  Union  of  NSW  has  stepped  up  its  censure  of  independent  Baptist   Pastor  Kevin  Harris   (pictured)  after  he  allegedly  told  Jewish  leaders—nicy—  m&gt;K   going  to  hell  and  would  face  a  fate  “worse  than  the  Holocaust”  because  they  failed  to  accept  Jesus  Christ   The  union  initially  declined  to  comment  directly  on  Pastor  Harris’  comments,  but  later  moved  to  sepa  rate  itself  from  the  pastor  after  Jewish  groups  expressed  outrage  over  the   incident.   The  union’s  president,  Reverend  Norm  Nix,  has  since  called  Pastor  Harris’  choice  of  words  “regrettable”  and  said  he  was  not  speaking  for  the   union  when  he  made  them.   He  also  emphasised  that  the  Amer  ican-born  pastor,  who  leads  the  Illawarra  Community  Baptist  Church,  was  not  affiliated  with  the  union,  and  had  not  undertaken  his  ministerial   training  with  Australian  Baptists.   “We  love  and  respect  Jewish  people,  and  seek  always  to  maintain  good  relations  with  people  of  other  faiths,”  said  Reverend  Nix.  “Churches  and  pastors  associated  with  the  Baptist  Union  of  NSW  seek  to  com  mend  their  Gospel  witness  by  expressing  respect  and  friendship  toward  the  leaders  or  representatives  of  other  religions,  and  by  modelling  Christian  character  and  diplomacy  in  all  relationships.”   NSW  Baptist  minister  and  ethicist  Reverend  Rod  Benson  added;  “Bap  tists  have  lived  as  a  religious  minority  for  400  years.  We  have  learned  by  hard  experience  what  it  is  to  be  persecuted  for  our  religious  beliefs  and  practices.  We  don’t  wish  that  for  anyone.”   The  snub  comes  after  Pastor  Har  ris’  alleged  comments  to  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  (JBD)  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  and  education  manager  Lynda  Ben-Menashe,  made  in  a  pri  vate  meeting  earlier  this  month,  were  leaked  to  the  media,  making  head   lines  worldwide.   Pastor  Harris  admitted  he  told  Qicru  tlxcit  anyo*vo  Aisj  not  HCQSDt  Jesus  suffered  from  a  “cancer”  and  that  Jews  were  doomed  to  face  “a  period  of  tribulation”  worse  than  the  Holocaust,  according  to  Christian  scripture.   “We  love  and  respect  Jewish  people,  and   seek  always  to  maintain  good  relations  with   people  of  other  faiths.”   -  REVEREND  NORM  NIX   President,  Baptist  Union   Alhadeff  has  commended  Rev   erend  Nix’s  approach.  “What  emerges  from  this  episode  is  that  people  in  positions  of  influence  must  send  a  message  that  acceptance  of  diversity  is  a  core  Australian  value,  and  that  den  igration  of  any  group  on  the  grounds  of  race  or  religion  is  completely  unac  ceptable,”  he  said.   Meanwhile,  Pastor  Harris  told  The  AJN  this  week  that  he  did  not  regret  his  choice  of  words,  and  said  he  felt  he  had  been  misquoted  and  misrepre  sented  by  Alhadeff.   “Since  I  did  not  single  out  all  Jews  as  hell-bound,  nor  did  I  say  Jews  were  going  to  suffer  a  fate  worse  than  the  Holocaust  because  they  reject  Jesus  as  Messiah,  I  have  nothing  to  regret,”  he  said.  “I  never  said  these  things  to  Alhadeff  or  Ben-Menashe,  and  my  wife  and  son  are  witnesses.” ",2008-11-28
"  ONE  SIDE  OF  THE  STORY   AS  a  vilifier  of  those  poor,  brave,  con  scientious  Jewish  souls,  Patrick  Wolfe  {AJN11/04),  I  see  things  differently  to  you.  I  see,  for  example,  those  consci  entious  whistleblowers  as  presenting  only  the  Palestinian  side  of  the  story.  They  omit  vital  information  about  how  when  the  Palestinians  were  dis  placed  during  the  1948  War  of  Inde  pendence,  Israel  was  fighting  for  its  very  survival.  They  omit  to  mention  the  role  of  the  Christian  Fallange  when  attacking  Ariel  Sharon  on  the   massacres  at  Sabra  and  Shatilla   refugee  camps.  They  say  nothing  of  the  murderous  activities  of  suicide  bombers  against  Israelis,  but  there’s  plenty  about  “Israel’s  murderous  activities  in  occupied  Palestine”,  and  on  they  go.   These  brave  conscientious  souls,  one  of  whom  makes  a  living  from  it,  use  emotive  and  inflammatory  lan  guage,  and  misinformation,  to  vilify  Israel  and  those  who  support  it,  but  God  forbid  anyone  should  criticise   them.

"  Unknown  Palin  perplexes  Jewish  voters   HERB  KEIHON   JERUSALEM  -  With  his  brash  and  bold   pick  of  Alaska  Governor  Sarah  Palin  as  his  running  mate,  presumptive  Republican  nominee  John  McCain  sewed  up  the  Eskimo  vote  (her  husband  is  part  Yup’ik  Eskimo).   But  it  will  take  some  time  before  it  will  be  possible  to  gauge  the  impact  on  other  key  US  constituencies,  such  as  the  Jews.   On  the  surface,  McCain’s  choice  seems  designed  to  realise  a  couple  of  key  campaign  objectives.   First,  it  is  widely  expected  to  galvanise  the  right-wing  evangelical  vote,  a  key  vote  McCain  will  need  if  he   is  to  win  the  White  House.   The  nightmare  for  McCain’s  strate  gists  is  not  that  this  critical  constituency  will  turn  out  and  vote  for  Obama;  it  won’t  Rather,  the  concern  is  that  it  will  just  stay  home.  During  an   election  where  African-American  vot   ers  are  widely  expected  to  turn  out  in  historic  numbers  to  vote  for  Demo  cratic  candidate  Barack  Obama,  a  stay-at-home  protest  by  the  evangeli  cals  could  doom  McCain’s  campaign.   Palin  is  a  Christian,  who  is  extremely  pro-life,  having  given  birth  to  a  child  with  Down  syndrome  rather  than  have  an  abortion.  That  position  will  certainly  enthuse  some  of  the  as  yet-unenthusiastic  evangelicals.   Secondly,  her  family  story  will  give  the  McCain  ticket  some  badly  needed  lunch-pail  credentials.  Palin,  or  more  specifically  her  husband,  is  someone  they  can  relate  to.  He’s  a  veteran  oil   field  worker  and  commercial  fisher  man,  and  a  union  member  to  boot   Obviously,  Palin’s  choice  was  an  attempt  to  woo  at  least  some  of  the  female  voters  disenchanted  by  Hillary   Clinton’s  defeat   Then  there  are  the  Jews.  Some  of  the  same  qualities  that  make  Palin  so  attractive  to  evangelicals  and  blue   collar  workers  —  her  anti-abortion  stand,  her  National  Rifle  Association  credentials,  her  membership  in  the  Fellowship  of  Christian  Athletes  -  will  make  many  Jews  nervous.  The  ques  tion  is  whether  it  will  make  many  of  those  who  vote  primarily  on  the  Israel  issue—a  minority  of  Jewish  votes  but  a  significant  population  in  a  key  state  like  Florida  -  nervous  enough  to  take   a  fresh  look  at  Obama.   Officials  in  Jerusalem  are  not  giv  ing  any  voting  advice.  They  are  smart  enough  to  realise  that  it  would  be  extremely  counterproductive  for   Israel  to  even  hint  at  a  favourite  in  this   close  presidential  race.   Privately,  the  prevalent  feeling  in  Jerusalem’s  corridors  of  power  is  that   Bristol  Palin  (right)  holds  her  four-month-old  brother  Trig  as  her  mother,  Alaska   Governor  Sarah  Palin  (centre),  waves  to  the  crowd  after  lohn  McCain  announced  Palin  as  his  running  mate.  On  Monday,  Palin  revealed  that  Bristol  Is  five  months   pregnant  and  unmarried.  Photo:  AAP   in  the  Obama-McCain  race,  “more  of  the  same”  -  the  epithet  Obama  is  throwing  at  McCain—is  not  that  bad.   When  it  comes  to  the  Middle  East,  Jerusalem  would  actually  embrace  “more  of  the  same”  from  the  next   White  House.  The  government  likes  what  has  come  from  the  Bush  admin  istration  over  the  past  number  of  years,  and  is  in  no  hurry  to  see  any   chanee  there.   JPOST.COM ",2008-09-05

""He  just  got  on  and  lived  them,  without  pretensions,  with  out  glamour,  without  drawing  attention  to  himself.""  FLTLT  Boreham  was  bom  in  Box  Hill,  Victoria,  on  September  25,  1957.  Married  to  Heather  for  31  years,  he  was  an  active  Christian  and  member  of  his  local  Salvation  Army  Corps,  who  also  supported  military  Christian  fel  lowship.  He  pursued  a  lifelong  inter-   est  in  aviation,  was  a  member  of  East  Sale  Flying  Club  and  was  Victoria's  youngest  licensed  parachute  packer.  He  owned  an  historic  glider  (not  the  one  which  crashed)  and  an  historic  wood  and  fabric  1930-style  aircraft.  He  was  a  keen  dragon  boater  and  supported  the  Breast  Cancer  Foundation  through  association  with  'Dragons  Abreast'.  He  worked  on  establish  ing  different  clubs  and  planned  and  conducted  a  community  dragon  boat  racing  day  on  Lake  Guthridge  earlier  this  year.   FLTLT  Boreham  joined  the  Air  Force  on  February  28,  1994.  After  his  training,  he  posted  to  No.  305  Air  Base  Wing  at  East  Sale  as  an  air  traffic  controller.  He  transferred  to  the  Logistics  Branch  in  February  1997  and  had  a  few  postings  at  East  Sale  before  posting  to  the  Puckapunyal  Military  Area  and  then  to  RAAF  Base  Williams.

"  bram  presser   A  tour  through  Jewish  Spain   EWISH  Spain,  like  the  so-called  Marranos  who  were  forced  to  convert   Uyet  continued  to  practise  their   Judaism  in  secret,  seems  only  to  exist   in  echoes,  alleyways  and  whispers.   There  is  something  decidedly  disconcert  ing  about  experiencing  Judaism  not  as  a  liv  ing  breathing  religion,  but  as  a  set  of  historical  landmarks.  Yet  when  my  girlfriend  Debbie  and  I  took  the  time  to  dig  a  little  deeper  on  a  recent  trip,  we  found  a  reward  ingly  different  Jewish  holiday  experience.   With  its  heavy  Christian  motifs  and  wan  dering  monks,  it  is  hard  to  believe  that  Seville  was  once  a  major  hub  of  Jewish  civilisation.  References  to  the  town  can  be  found  in  bibli  cal  texts,  where  it  is  referred  to  as  Tarshish,  meaning  that  Jews  were  in  the  area  as  far  back  as  the  11th  century  BCE.   Like  with  most  of  Spain,  Jewish  life  in  Seville  came  to  a  crashing  end  with  one  of  the  country’s  most  dramatic  massacres  in  1391.  Nearly  the  entire  Jewish  community  -  some  4000  people  -  was  wiped  out  in  a  single  day,  and  the  town’s  ornate  synagogues  were  quickly  converted  into  churches.   As  we  walked  through  what  once  was  the  Jewish  quarter  in  the  Barrio  de  Santa  Cruz,  I  could  well  imagine  the  bustling  trade  of  Jewish  merchants  on  the  narrow  cobbled  streets.  There  may  be  no  real  Jewish  land  marks  to  see,  but  the  feel  is  one  of  old   The  men’s  mikvah  in  Barcelona.   European  Jewry.   It  didn’t  take  long  to  find  the  Jewish  quar  ter  in  Barcelona,  El  Call  -  our  apartment  hap  pened  to  be  right  at  its  entrance.   Barcelona  is  the  first  Spanish  city  in  which  a  Jewish  community  resurfaced  after  the  expulsion  and,  though  small,  it  is  active  in  preserving  and  promoting  the  city’s  Jewish  history.  Following  the  clear  signs  we  found  the  main  synagogue,  a  tiny  excavated  stone  room  dating  back  to  212  CE.  We  wound  our  way  through  the  claustrophobia-induc  ing  alleyways  to  a  small  furniture  shop  that  housed  at  its  back  the  old  men’s  mikvah.  The  golden  light  shining  in  through  the  now  glassed-over  rain  hole  gave  the  place  an  eerie  glow.   Simply  walking  around  El  Call  was  a  rewarding  experience.  Reminders  of  its  Jewish  past  still  line  the  streets:  discoloured  recesses  where  mezuzahs  once  lay;  stars  of  David  ornately  decorated  around  with  Christian  motifs  on  the  churches  that  once  were  synagogues;  and  even  bricks  carved  with  Hebrew.

"  Politics  from   the  pulpit   WASHINGTON  -  Intense  interest  in  the  presidential  election,  combined  with  the  desire  among  many  rabbis  to  speak  out  when  pews  are  packed  for  the  high  holy  days,  has  left  many  rabbis  grappling  with  what  they  can  say  from  the  pulpit  as  they  navigate  the  legal  thicket  of  church-state  reg   ulations  in  the  United  States.   The  Internal  Revenue  Service  has  recently  increased  its  scrutiny  of  reli  gious  institutions,  which  are  legally  restricted  from  backing  candidates.   This  has  come  to  the  fore  due  to  a  number  of  Evangelical  Christian  leaders  who  are  planning  a  direct  challenge  to  these  restrictions.   Jewish  communal  leaders  are  probing  similar  controversial  territory  as  they  look  to  get  involved  in  the  presidential  election.   “Everyone  knows  the  basic  rules,”  said  Rabbi  David  Saperstein,  director  and  counsel  of  the  Religious  Action  Centre  of  Reform  Judaism.   “You  can  talk  about  issues,  but  you  can't  endorse  candidates  and  parties,  but  there  are  all  these  grey  areas  in  between  that  people  are  struggling  with.""   Rabbis  and  Jewish  communal  leaders  have  increasingly  stepped  up  their  own  public  advocacy  for  candi  dates,  but  the  effort  has  remained  outside  the  synagogue.   The  recently  launched  grassroots  organisation  Rabbis  for  Obama  is   one  such  example.   THE  FORWARD ",2008-10-03

JEWS  FOR  JUDAISM   AFTER  speaking  with  Professor  Amy  Jill  Levine,  it  is  dear  to  me  that  the  professor  was  in  no  way  suggesting  that  “messianic  Judaism”  should  be   given  legitimacy  in  the  Jewish  world  (AJN  04/07).  What  Professor  Levine  does  suggest  is  recognising  that  those  Jews,  who  have  come  to  believe  in  Jesus  as  their  lord  and  saviour,  are  Jews.   Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  they  have  estranged  themselves  from  Judaism,  we  should  still  view  them  as  our  Jewish  brethren.  They  need  to  be  lovingly  encouraged  back  into  the  Jewish  community,  instead  of  us  writ  ing  them  off  to  Christianity  forever.  Jewish  people  embracing  Christian  doctrine  is  unfortunately  a  very  real  phenomenon.  If  we  close  our  eyes  to  the  reality  and  convince  ourselves  that  it’s  not  really  happening,  then  who’s  to  say  that  your  child  or  grandchild  won’t  be  the  next  Jew  for  Jesus?

"  NEWSPEAK’S  NEW  HEIGHTS   IN  their  opinion  piece  “Self-Defence  or  Brutal  Occupation”  (The  Age,  31/03),  Peter  Slezak  and  Antony  Loewenstein  could  only  have  been  guided  by  James  Joyce’s  instruction  to  “shut  your  eyes  and  see”,  as  written  in  the  first  chapter  of  Ulysses.  How  else  can  one  fathom  the  “facts”  that  the  authors  set  out?  Through  a  mixture  of  tendentious  statements  and  quotes  from  secondary  sources  by  “Israeli  historians”  well-known  by  their  revi-  sionist  slant  of  Middle  East  history,   Slezak  and  Loewenstein  succeed  admirably  in  the  newspeak  that  is  becoming  de  rigueur  among  the  trendy  left.  It  is  through  this  newspeak  that  the  Christian  Fallange  groups  are  not  mentioned  regarding  the  massacres  in  Sabra  and  Shatilla,  while  Israel’s  Defence  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  is.   As  for  the  claim  that  “Israel  is  not   the  state  of  its  citizens  but  only  of  the  Jewish  people,  thereby  officially  dis-  criminating  against  one-fifth  of  its  population”,  Slezak  and  Loewenstein   know  —  or  should  do  —  that  Arabs  in   Israel  have  full  voting  rights,  have  five  members  of  the  Knesset,  have  an  Arab  minister,  an  Arab  consul  in  the  USA  and  Arab  judges.

"  NPA  College  fine  tunes  for  Yumpla  Festival   When  students  at  NPA  College  heard  that  popular  student  dance  festival  Croc  Fest  would  not  go  ahead  this  year,  they  decided  to  do  something  about  it.  Croc  Fest  was  a  highlight  for  many  students  which  gave  them  a  chance  to  display  their  creative  and  artistic  talent.  So  senior  students  at  the  NPA  College  got  together  with  their  teachers  and  members  of  the   community  to  create  a  new  festival  called  Yumpla.  The  Yumpla  Festival  will  run  over  two  days  from  Thursday  and  Friday,  October  16-17,  and  promises  to  be  an  explosion  of  culture,  creativity,  artistry  and  performance.  There  will  be  workshops  with  visiting  artists  and  community  members   which  will  end  in  a  big  concert  on  the  Friday  night  at  the  Yusia  Ginau  Oval.  Year  12  Student  representative  Bewan  Idai  says  the  students  are  all  excited  about  the  event.  ""It's  a  great  opportunity  for  students  to  express  their  creative  side  and  also  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  traditional  aspect  of  their  life  as  indigenous  students,""  Bewan   said   -  DANIEL  O'BRIEN.

"  satire  section   NAME  CHANGE   From  Arc  to  Arq   Alan  Zeino   In  keeping  with  its  annual  tradition  of  a  name  change,  the  Arc@UNSW  is  the  target  this  week  of  a  Queer  Putsch  calling  for  it  to  be  renamed  as  Arq  for  next  year.The  name  change  will  inevitably  be  debated  at  Arc's  Annual  General  Meeting,  which  is  to  be  held  in  the  offices  of  the  ALP  next  Wednesday.  The  news  has  caused  an  outcry  from  UNSW's  conservative  societies.  Susan  McWhite  of  Christian  Students  has  labelled  the  proposal  as  an  ""undeniable  plot  to  further  the  cause  of  liberalism  and  freedom  of  speech  on  campus"".  ""There  might  be  a  place  for  a  Queer-affiliated  union  somewhere  in  the  Muslim  world,  but  not  here  -  not  in  our  tolerant  and  secular  society""  she  said.  Her  erroneous  comment  has  been  echoed  by  Hillsong  Campus  President  James  Toto,  who  opposes  the  name  change  on  the  principle  that""Jesus  loved  all,  and  in  the  name  of  Jesus  and  all  that  is  Jesus,  Jesus  has  a  strong  opinion  on  this  matter.  Give  me  a  few  minutes  while  I  look  it  up  in  this  book  I've  got...  fuck  it's  bloody  big"".  However,  the  name  change  has  found  support  with  an  Arc  representative  who  noted  that  it  was  a  positive  move  for  the  organisation  particularly  when  a  name  change  would  help  students  forget  about  our  lack  of  services  last  year.

"  Kevin  Rudd:  Australia's  New  Prime  Minister   Alan  Zeino   In  one  of  the  many  notable  events  that  occurred  over  the  university  break,  Kevin  Rudd  was  elected  Prime  Minister  of  Australia  after  a  Short  and  Jocular  Conversation  with  the  electorate.  Australia  disposed  of  its  eleven-year  Thetan-dropping  Volcano-loving  Xenu  John  Howard.  In  the  process  of  doing  so  they  also  threw  out  a  few  others  past  their  use-by-date,  including  Mai  Brough  and  Jackie  ""I'm  not  racist  but  fuck  everyone  from  that  Middle  Eastern  region""Kelly  (but  unfortunately  not  Jackie  O).  Australians  watched  in  disgust  as  channels  Seven  and  Nine  bothered  to  host  election  coverage  on  the  night,  while  the  rest  of  us  laughed  pompously  along  with  Kerry  O'Brien  and  his  hilarious,  ""I  for  one  welcome  our  new  Labor  overlords""  quip.

"  AUSTRALIA  2020  AND  BEYOND   Sam  Chung   Due  to  some  odd  coincidence  two  irrelevant  events  occurred  on  April  19th,  2008  -1  turned  25  and  a  1000  Australians  converged  on  Canberra  to  produce  (or  reiterate)  ideas.  I  have  to  admit  I  didn't  pay  much  attention  to  the  initial  machinations  of  the  2020  Summit,  I  was  too  busy  feeling  old.  The  evening  news  didn't  help  either,  I  found  myself  rolling  my  eyes  at  the  recurring  2020  reports.  It  seemed  like  I  was  watching  a  television  miniseries.  It  had  quite  a  good  cast,  as  three  main  characters  were  played  by  Cate  Blanchett,  Hugh  Jackman  and  Tim  Costello.  Like  all  good  programs,  there  were  many  nameless,  faceless  but  indispensable  mysterious  extras.  Like  all  bad  but  popular  programs  it  had  a  repetitive  theme  -  the  Republic  idea  was  resuscitated  and  shortly  after  a  deceased  character  was  magically  alive  again.  Alexander  Downer,  who  finds  Parliament  too  boring  but  is  happy  to  attend  Queen's  birthday  celebrations,  derided  the  Summit  as  simply  having  a'sprinkling  of  conservatives.'Like  all  PG  programs,   the  discussion  of  anything  remotely  interesting  and  nothing  radical  was  attempted.  What  does  this  have  to  do  with  women's  issues?  A  few  months  ago  the  government  was  faced  with  a  public  relations  disaster.  Various  people  had  already  derided  the  2020  Summit,  but  when  the  Steering  Committee  was  announced  people  asked  how  could  only  one  woman  make  the  Top  10?  Not  just  any  woman,  a  celebrity  that  conveniently  fell  into'creative  arts'.  Trying  to  remove  the  sexist  tag,  the  government  assured  us  that  the  selections  were  merit-based  and  immediately  (ap)  pointed  the  six  female  co-chairs.  From  the  moment  the  government  claimed  that  the  appointments  were  based  on  merit,  anyone  criticising  them  for  .  other  reasons  were  immediately  cast  as  'anti-merit'.  Something  all  groups  should  avoid.  I  believe  this  is  when  feminists  lost  this  particular  battle.  Rather  than  repeating  the  sexist  charge,  feminists  should  have  adapted  and  played  the  governments'  game.  The  government  had  proclaimed  that   IMAGE  Emma  Pike  STILL  FROM  VIDEO  COfA  BFAÏœeEtedAri  The  day  you  met  my  robot   the  selection  was  purely  based  on  merit  but  it  was  quite  obvious  that,  at  least  in  relation  to  some,  it  was  not.  Some  groups  suggested  alternatives  to  those  who  had  already  been  appointed,  but  few  were  game  enough  to  question  the  original  appointees.  I  can't  discuss  every  single  one  but  there  was  one  appointment  that  annoyed  me  immensely.  The  person  responsible  for  the  discussion  on'the  future  of  Australian  governance'was  John  Hartigan.  If  you  visit  the  Australia  2020  summit  website  you  will  find  a  biography  that  details  his  impressive  media  career,  as  a  former  editor  of  the  Daily  Telegraph,  and  former  CEO  and  current  director  of  News  Ltd.  He  is  also  a  director  of  the  Bradman  Foundation,  the  American-Australian  Association  and  the  NSW  Wine  Industry  Council.  Hartigan  may  well  have  other  qualifications  and  experience  that  would  justify  his  appointment,  but  if  he  had  it,  the  Australian  government  chose  not  to  emphasise  it.  There  was  not  one  element  in  his  biography  that  indicated  that  Hartigan  had  any  expertise  or  qualifications  on  governance,  not  on  a  legal  or  national  level.  Does  anyone  really  believe  that  he  was  apparently  the  most  qualified  Australian  to  organise  this  particular  discussion?  Anyone  who  was  vaguely  awake  realised  that  this  process,  like  any  other  government  process,  was  political.  Feminists  should  have  accentuated  this  point.  By  establishing  that  the  appointments  were  political,  the  governments'claim  that  they  were  merit-based  would  have  collapsed  and  the  allegations  of  sexism  would  have  become  more  credible.  Feminists  lost  the  battle  and  tarnished  their  reputation  because  they  didn't  play  by  the  government's  rules.  Sometimes  subverting  and  challenging  rules  is  indispensable,  but  sometimes  it  is  more  advantageous  to  exploit  them  for  your  own  use.  An  atheist  will  never  convince  a  Christian  that  there  is  no  God,  but  an  atheist  can  influence  a  Christian  by  exploiting  the  Bible  to  argue  against  a  particular  viewpoint.  Deciding  whether  to  accept  rules  or  to  challenge  them  will  always  depend  on  what  your  objectives  are.  What  do  feminists  wish  to  achieve?  How  can  those  objectives  be  met?  By  undermining  institutions  or  by  infiltrating  them?  But  most  importantly,  one  question  that  is  too  rarely  asked:  will  our  involvement  help  or  hinder  this  particular  cause?

"  Church  turned  into  synagogue   BERLIN  -  A  300-seat  synagogue  that  opened  last  week  in  Bielefeld,  in  west  ern  Germany,  was  set  up  in  a  former  Lutheran  church.   Juergen  Ruettgers,  prime  minister  of  North  Rhine-Westphalia  state,  where  Bielefeld  is  located,  said  at  the  opening  that  the  building  project  was  a  ""sign  of  trust  and  hope”  by  German  Jews.  ""What  the  Nazis  wanted  has  failed,”  he  added,  hailing  the  revival  of  the  Jewish  culture  in  the  country.   An  earlier  synagogue  in  the  city  was  gutted  by  fire  70  years  ago  during  the  first  wave  of  Kristallnacht,  or  Night  of  Shattered  Glass,  when  the  Nazis  started  persecuting  the  Jews.  It  is  the  first  time  in  Germany  that  a  Lutheran  church  has  been  transformed  into  a  synagogue.   The  interior  of  the  church  was  fully  converted  from  a  Christian  to  a  Jewish  space.  The  church  bells  were  removed  last  year  and  the  top  of  the  steeple  was  changed  from  a  point  to  a  dome.   Work  continued  for  one  year  and  cost  some  2.5  million  euros.   The  local  Jewish  community,  which  numbers  32,000  people,  has  grown  over  the  past  years  because  of  the  arrival  of  immigrants  from  Eastern  Europe.   A  similar  project  of  transformation  of  a  church  into  a  synagogue  is  in  progress  in  Spire,  in  south-western  Germany.   Several  synagogues  have  been  inaugurated  or  renovated  since  the  end  of  2006  in  the  country,  in  partic  ular  in  Munich,  Berlin,  Bochum  and  recently  in  Krefeld.

"  THE  CLEVER  CALENDAR   SECRETS  of  the  Jewish  calendar”   (AJN  08/02)  reminded  one  how  only  the  Jewish  calendar  has  managed  to   reconcile  the  three  distinct  motions  of   the  solar,  lunar  and  diurnal  periods:  “to  be  for  seasons,  and  for  days  and  years”  (Bereshit  1).  “For  this  is  your  wisdom  and  understanding  in  the  eyes  of  the  nations”  (Devarim  4)  -  this  refers  to  the  calculations  of  astronomy  and  calendars  (Shabbos  75).   The  Christian  world  has  its  years  correctly  calculated,  but  not  the  months.  The  365  days  of  the  year  are  arbitrarily  divided  into  12  months,  which  have  no  relation  to  the  orbit  of  the  moon.   The  Muslims  have  correct  months,  but  incorrect  years.  They  simply  make  the  12  lunar  months  into  a  year  of  354  days,  which  is  11  short!  The  result  is  that  their  festivals  are  not  bound  to  the  seasons  of  the  year.   At  the  time  of  the  calendrical   reform,  when  it  was  suggested  to  Pope  Gregory  that  it  might  be  easier  to  adopt  the  Jewish  calendar,  he  exclaimed:  ‘“Tis  better  to  be  wrong  with  the  calendar  than  right  with  the   Jews!”   An  absolute  reconciliation  of  the   lunar  calendar  with  the  solar  year  is  impossible.  Discrepancies  in  Hillel  ITs  calendar  are  now  starting  to  be  noticed,  but  the  Chofetz  Chaim  wrote  that  “we  need  not  be  overly  concerned  much  beyond  the  next  century  because  certainly  at  that  time  there  will  be  the  Geulah,  and  we  will  sanctify  the  new  moon  by  direct  visual   observation”.

"  DOES  O’LOUGHUN  EXPLAIN?   WHEN  I  heard  that  Ed  O’Loughlin  was  to  explain  his  Israel  reporting  in  your  newspaper,  I  anticipated  he  might  emulate  Kevin  Rudd,  so  I  waited  for  his  heartfelt  apology  for  his  biased  coverage.  Alas,  there  was  nothing  of   the  sort.   O’Loughlin  claims  he  doesn’t  refer  to  suicide  bombers  as  “militants”,  but  he  once  wrote  of  a  Palestinian  schoolboy  wearing  a  suicide  belt:  “...  Abdo  is  an  impressionable  teenager  [who]  illustrates  the  way  in  which  Palestinian  militant  groups  send  the  young  and  vulnerable  to  carry  out  sui   cide  attacks  on  their  behalf’.   On  Hanan  Ashrawi,  O’Loughlin  ignores,  a  recent  George  Negus  inter  view,  in  which  she  talked  of  articles  coming  from  Australia  “trying  to  jus  tify  what  Hamas  was  doing  by  saying  it   had  to  deal  with  a  situation  that  was  unruly  or  a  situation  of  lawlessness.  You  do  not  correct  one  error  by  com  mitting  another.”   Moreover,  he  neglects  to  address  major  criticisms  about  his  use  of  warped  standards  of  moral  equiva  lence  and  his  selectivity  in  presenting  the  news.  Many  readers  also  want  to  know  why  he  is  reluctant  to  cover  Hamas’  genocidal  charter  against  Jews,   its  connection  to  the  Muslim  brother  hood,  its  incitement  to  murder  in  its  media,  attacks  on  Christian  communi  ties  and  countless  war  crimes.  Surely,  these  must  be  addressed  before  a  reporter  can  be  considered  “a  reliable  source”  for  news  from  the  region?   In  his  defence,  of  course,  O’Loughlin  can  always  plead  he  was  on  “another  assignment”  elsewhere  at   the  time.   JACK  CHRAPOT   Elsternwick,  Vic ",2008-02-29
"  German   support  for   Hezbollah  ban   BENJAMIN  WEINTHAL   BERLIN  -  Hezbollah  is  a  ""terrorist  organisation,  supported  and  financed  by  Iran  and  also  supported  by  Syria,”  according  to  Dirk  Niebel,  the  general  secretary  of  Germany's  Free  Demo-  cratic  Party  (FDP)  following  a  recent  visit  to  Israel.   The  FDP  is  Germany's  third  largest  political  party.   In  a  media  interview  after  his  return  home,  Niebel  was  asked  what  he  thought  of  the  idea  of  a  parlia-  mentary  initiative  to  ban  Hezbollah  in  Germany.  “I  think  it's  lovely,”  he  replied.   The  Jerusalem  Post  reported  in  early  August  that  Germany’s  lax  anti-  terrorist  laws  allow  Hezbollah  to  oper-  ate  in  the  country  and  to  wire  funds  to  families  of  suicide  bombers  who  killed  Israelis.   According  to  German  intelligence  reports,  900  Hezbollah  members  are  based  in  30  mosques  and  cultural  centres  in  the  Federal  Republic.   While  the  government  coalition  led  by  Christian  Democrats  and  Social  Democrats  has  refused  to  prohibit  Hezbollah's  activities,  the  FDP  intro-  duced  a  parliamentary  inquiry  in  2007  seeking  a  more  exhaustive  account  of  Hezbollah's  network  in  the  country.   Responding  to  the  information  request,  the  government  declared  there  was  ""no  danger  from  Hezbollah  supporters  in  Germany”,  yet  acknowl-  edged  ""that  Islamic  propaganda  can  cause  or  increase  a  radicalisation  of  the  Islamic  scene  in  Germany.""   Niebel,  45,  volunteered  at  Kibbutz  Kfar  Giladi,  near  Kiryat  Shmona,  dur-  ing  1982-1983.  He  referred  this  week  to  his  early  exposure  to  Hezbollah  ter-  rorism  during  the  Lebanon  War  in  1982,  and  stressed  that  Hezbollah  was  not  an  organisation  that  could  be   worked  with.

"  Masada  College   THIS  year,  Masada  College  is  focusing   on  developing  a  culture  of  thinking,  strengthening  leadership  skills  and  advancing  education.  Leadership  is  central  in  the  primary  school,  with  HICES  Leadership  Day  and  National  Young  Leaders  Day  both  ushering  in  the  new  school  year.   Inter-faith  programs  are  planned  for  the  whole  school,  with  Year  9  students  partici  pating  in  several  sessions,  including  a  visit  to  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum  and  culminating  in  a  symposium  involving  Masada  with  Muslim  and  Christian  schools  from  diverse  backgrounds.  The  high  school  is  also  soon  to  be  involved  in  an  indigenous  program.   With  the  formation  of  the  Masada  College  Environment  Committee  last  year,  “sustain  ability”  is  the  catch-phrase  at  the  school.  .   A  perfect  start  to  this  will  be  the  Clean  Up  Masada  Day  in  the  primary  school,  followed  by  a  Clean  Up  Australia  Day  in  the  high  school.  There  will  also  be  Green  Sunday,  together  with  the  JNF  and  Nude  Food  Day  (where  students  bring  food  with  no  dispos  able  packaging),  and  that’s  just  for  Term  1!   Photography  is  now  offered  as  an  elective  at  the  school  and  will  be  taught  by  newly  appointed  Paulette  Fisher  in  the  art  depart  ment.  Fisher  brings  her  strong  background  in  film  and  media  to  the  school.   The  school’s  major  drama  production  this  year  will  be  A  Comedy  of  Errors.   2008  will  also  see  the  next  stage  of  plan  ning  with  architects  for  the  upcoming  con  solidation  of  the  two  campuses  in  St  Ives  with  all  the  educational,  social  and  practical  advantages  it  will  bring.

"  ACHIEVER  OFF  TO  PRAGUE   CANBERRA  -  Tessa  Forshaw,  an  18-year-old  commerce  student  at  Canberra’s  Australian  National  University  (ANU),  has  been  chosen  to  attend  the  International  Youth  Leadership  Conference  in  Prague  later  this  month.   Forshaw  was  one  of  130  dele  gates  chosen  from  more  than  260,000  worldwide  applicants  to  represent  their  country  at  the  weeklong  forum  on  politics,  inter  national  relations  and  law  for  18  to  24-year-olds.   Forshaw  is  active  in  the  ACT  Jewish  community  and  is  vice  president  of  the  ANU  Jewish  Stu  dents  Society.  She  has  an  interest   ambassador  to  the  Arab  league,  Indonesian  ministers,  journalists  and  current  and  former  politicians.   Jones  said  the  delegates  “were  not  used  to  being  in  a  con  ference  where  Jewish  voices  were  present”.  But,  he  added,  the  informal  setting  had  contributed  to  “an  overwhelming  feeling  that  there  were  people  desperate  to  leam  in  a  positive  way  about  Jewish  views  of  the  world”.   Jones  added  that  Australian  Jewry’s  strong  relationship  with  local  Christian  and  Muslim  groups  had  provided  a  powerful  ice  breaker  for  the  forum  and  Dr  Amir  Ali,  the  former  president  of  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils,  introduced  Jones  as  a  “colleague  and  a  friend""  to  the  international  delegates.   in  social  work  and  has  previously  been  involved  with  the  United  Nations  Association  Victoria,  Oxfam,  World  Vision,  the  Oaktree  Foundation  and  the  Make  Poverty  History  concert.

"  ?   T  his  is  a  story  written  by  Mabuiag's  lailie  Repu,  Year  10  student  at  The  Cathedral  School  in  Townsville.  Valentine's  Day  used  to  be  an  ancient  Roman  festival  for  young  lovers  called  Lupercalia.  Back  then  it  was  on  15  February  however  the  Christian  church  changed  it  to  14  February.  The  dates  changed  because  they  didn't  want  Valentine's  Day  only  for  the  young  lovers,  but  they  also  wanted  everyone  to  celebrate  so  they  changed  the  name  to  Saint  Valentine's  Day.  Now  it's  for  sweethearts,  friends  or  relatives.  St  Valentine  lived  in  Rome  during  the  third  century  underthe  ruling  of  Emperor  Claudius.  Claudius  didn't  want  all  the  men  to  get  married  because  if  they  got  married  they  didn't  join  the  army.  However  St  Valentine  was  a  priest  who  was  secretly  performing  marriage  ceremonies.  St  Valentine  was  then  caught  marrying  couples  and  the  Emperor  threw  him  into  jail  and  told  him  his  punishment  was  DEATH.  While  he  was  in  jail  he  met  the  guard's  daughter  and  they  would  sit  and  talk  for  hours.  The  day  that  he  was  to  die  he  left  a  note  for  his  friend  saying  thank  you  and  he  signed  it  with  ""Love  from  your  Valentine.""  This  letter  was  found  on  14  February,  the  day  that  St  Valentine  died,  this  day  is  now  the  day  for  exchanging  love  messages.  Every  year  on  this  day,  everyone  now  thinks  about  sending  poems  and  simple  gifts  to  spread  love  and  friendship.  A  traditional  verse  that  was  sung  on  Valentine's  Day  in  England  was:   Good  morning  to  you,  valentine  Curl  your  locks  as  I  do  mine  Two  before  and  three  behind.

It  is  a  vital   aspect  of  the  JBD’s  work.”   The  tour  will  indude  areas  such   as  Nowra,  Wollongong,  Port  Kembla,  Kiama  andVincentia,  and  cover  topics  such  as  the  Arab  Israeli  conflict,  Nazi  Germany  and  the  Holocaust,  Jewish  life  in  Aus  tralia  and  Judaism.

"  ?   It  might  strike  you  that  within  these  three  points,  there  is  no  explicit  mention  of  personal  satisfaction,  pleasure  or  even  love,  which  are  things  that  society  in  general  seems  to  think  are  reasonable  justifications  for  a  sexual  relationship,  and  probably  necessary  for  marriage.  The  title  of  the  book  should  have  given  a  clue  that  in  the  Christian  world  view,  marriage  should  be  something  undertaken  to  serve  God,  rather  than  solely  personal  interest  and  desire.  By  contrast,  secular  couples  don't  have  this  ""third  cord""  of  God  in  their  marriage,  and  are  unlikely  to  see  their  actions  as  being  inherently  good  or  necessary  for  society.  The  three  reasons  for  marriage  given  by  Ash  seem  much  less  idealistic  and  much  more  pragmatic  than  secular  reasons  for  entering  such  a  relationship.  This  notion  of  serving  a  higher  purpose  through  marriage  is  perhaps  the  most  interesting  difference  between  secular  and  Christian  marriages.  This  seems  to  make  secular  marriages  more  introspective  than  Christian  ones,  at  least  in  terms  of  where  they  find  their  motivation.  Perhaps  having  God  as  part  of  the  marriage  equation  gives  greater  confidence  to  the  parties  getting  married,  and  perhaps  this  confidence  is  one  reason  why  more  young  Christian  couples  seem  to  get  married  than  young  secularcouples.  Without  believing  in  the  support  of  a  higher  authority,  it  might  be  hard  to  believe  that  you  could  know  yourself  or  another  person  adequately  to  make  that  sort  of  commitment.  On  the  other  hand,  perhaps  this  lack  of  God  in  secular  relationships  is  a  real  strength.  It's  plausible  that  the  declining  rates  of  marriage  could  be  at  least  partly  attributable  to  people  choosing  other  foundations  for  their  relationship  than  a  commitment  to  God,  and  the  outcome  of  that  process  is  the  rejection  of  the  need  for  a  formal  ceremony.  This  returns  us  to  the  idea  that  a  deceptively  simple  ""yes""  in  a  ceremony  committing  two  people  to  married  life  is  both  logical  and  illogical:  logical  because  if  you  care  about  someone  enough  to  say  it,  then  you  might  as  well.  Simultaneously  illogical,  however,  because  if  you  care  about  someone  that  much,  it  doesn't  need  to  be  said. ",2009-04-03
"  ALICE  LANG   On  Valentine's  Day  this  year,  I  went  to  the  wedding  of  a  good  friend.  She's  23,  and  her  husband  is  of  a  similar  age.  Just  back  from  a  trip  to  Europe  and  still  jet  lagged,  I  probably  wasn't  feeling  as  excited  as  I  should  have  been.  However,  once  the  service  began,  I  was  astonished  at  how  overwhelmed  I  felt  with  happiness  and  love  for  my  friend;  it  felt  as  though  everyone  in  the  church  was  just  bursting  with  hope  and  optimism  for  this  couple.  The  part  of  the  ceremony  where  they  took  each  other  to  be  husband  and  wife  was  very  brief.  Merely  seconds.  And  yet  afte  r  that,  it  s  all  different.  It  looked  so  simple  from  where  I  was  sitting,  and  to  me,  this  deceptive  simplicity  of  saying  ""yes""  in  front  of  people  is  precisely  what  makes  marriage  both  a  logical  and  an  illogical  step.  At  about  the  same  time,  a  friend  wrote  to  me  from  France,  where  she's  been  for  several  months  with  her  (Australian)  boyfriend,  to  say  that  they  had  gotten  married.  Just  like  that!  Apparently  there  were  a  few  days  between  deciding  to  get  married,  and  going  to  the  registrar's  office  for  a  civil  ceremony.  She's  21.  ""Perhaps  having  God  as  part  of  the  marriage  equation  gives  greater  confidence  to  the  young  people  getting  married""  When  I  returned  to  Sydney  after  being  away,  there  were  yet  more  engaged  couples  to  learn  of!  They  range  in  age  from  19  to  23.  Since  starting  at  university,  I've  been  amazed  at  how  many  people  my  age  have  chosen  to  get  engaged  and  married.  It  is  only  fair  to  say  that  this  phenomenon  is  most  obvious  amongst  Christian  friends.  Many  of  my  non-Christian  friends,  when  I  mention  this  to  them,  find  the  whole  notion  somewhat  absurd  and  certainly  perplexing,  though  that  isn't  to  say  there  aren't  young  non-Christian  couples  getting  married  as  well.  With  no  prospect  of  marriage  any  time  soon,  I've  decided  to  comfort  myself  with  the  statistics:  as  of  2000,  women  were  most  likely  to  be  married  between  the  ages  of  25-29,  while  for  men  it  is  25-34,  both  of  which  are  an  older  age  bracket  than  in  1970.  The  marriage  rate  has  generally  been  falling  since  the  1970s.  The  divorce  rate  has  generally  been  increasing  since  the  late  1970s.  When  my  parents  married  at  the  age  of  21  almost  four  decades  ago,  marriage  at  that  age  was  quite  common.  But  half  way  through  my  degree,  the  idea  of  marriage  seems  like  an  unattractively  huge  commitment.  More  generally,  such  early  marriages  don't  gel  well  with  a  contemporary  desire  to  explore  different  options:  of  lifestyles,  partners  and  relationships,  to  finish  university  and  to  travel  the  world.  Committing  to  a  life  long  relationship  with  one  person  seems  to  limit  the  scope  for  experimentation  and  discovering  what  you  think  about  the  world.  But  perhaps  this  is  entirely  the  wrong  way  to  look  at  it...  When  I  talk  about  this  with  secular  young  people,  they  frequently  say  ""well,  they're  just  getting  married  so  they  can  have  sex.""  But  if  this  means  to  say  that  Christian  couples  will  later  tire  of  each  other  and  eventually  find  others  to  have  sex  with,  that  doesn't  seem  to  be  the  case.  In  fact,  one  Christian  man  I  spoke  to  believed  that  many,  though  not  all,  of  those  people  choosing  to  get  married  early  do  so  because  they  believe  that  a  sexual  relationship  is  a  one  off,  for  life,  arrangement.  In  this  context,  the  ""try  before  you  buy""  mentality  does  not  make  a  lot  of  sense,  but  to  a  certain  extent  the  secularist  simplification  is  correct.  However,  it's  more  interesting  to  consider  the  ""real""  reasons  that  Christians  marry,  as  interpreted  from  the  bible  and  presented  by  Christopher  Ash  in  Married  for  God.  Bearing  in  mind  the  idea  that  sex  should  be  confined  entirely  to  marriage,  he  identifies  these  reasons  for  marriage:  1.  Children  rather  than  barrenness:  sex  is  in  order  to  have  children,  and  children  are  a  good  thing.  2.  Faithfulness  rather  than  selfishness:  sex  is  for  faithful  intimacy,  and  an  intimate  relationship  is  a  good  thing.  3.  Order  rather  than  chaos:  marriage  guards  sexual  desires  from  destroying  society,  so  that  society  does  not  descend  into  sexual  chaos. ",2009-04-03

"  Opinion   Letters  to  the  Editor  email:  editor@torresnews.comau  fax:  1300  STRAIT  (1300  787  248)   Closer  links  with  Catholicism  historic,  says  Church  of  Torres  Strait   The  Anglican  tradition  has  been  very  influential  in  the  Torres  Strait  for  well  over  one  hundred  years.  The  founding  a  little  over  ten  years  ago  of  the  (  hureh  of  forres  Strait,  a  member  church  of  the  world-wide  Traditional  Anglican  Communion  is  one  of  the  groups  of  former  Anglicans  that  the  Pope  has  m  mind  in  making  this  wonderful  pro\  ision.  The  I  AC  is  a  communion  of  churches  in  the  anghcan  tradition.  The  I  AC  has  member  churches  in  Africa,  Australia,  forres  Strait,  Canada,  Central  and  South  America,  Lngland,  Ireland,  India,  Pakistan,  Japan  and  the  United  States.  Membership  is  estimated  at  around  400,000.  l'he  TAC  is  governed  by  the  Bishops  of  all  member  churches  meeting  as  a  College  of  Bishops,  l.very  bishop  swears  an  oath  at  his   consecration  to  observe  the  Concordat,  the  document  that  regulates  the  conduct  of  the  bishops  and  the  life  of  the  TAC.  The  foundation  document  of  the  Traditional  Anglican  Communion  is  the  Affirmation  of  St.  Louis.  This  inspiring  document  commits  traditional  anglicans  to  keep  the  Faith  that  was  ""Once  delivered  to  the  Saints.""  The  TAC  College  of  Bishops  signed  their  approval  of  the  Catechism  of  the  Catholic-  Church  at  a  ceremony  during  their  last  meeting  in  Portsmouth,  Hngland  in  2007  and  then  made  a  request  for  'full  and  visible  communion'  to  Pope  Benedict  XVI.  The  Bishop  of  the  Torres  Strait,  Right  Reverend  Tolowa  Nona  SSC,  welcoming  the  provision  of  the  Pope  said,  ""The  TAC  declared  that  we  share  the  same  faith  and  ministry  as  expressed  in  the  Catechism  of  the  Catholic  Church.  This  is  the  faith  that  Christ  taught  to  His  Church.  As  Traditional  Anglicans  the  time  has  come  to  express  that  unity  in  visible  form-  in  full  communion  with  the  I  loly  See  and  the  more  than  one  billion  Catholic  Christians  in  all  parts  of  the  world.  This  also  means  that  forres  Strait  clergy  can  be  assured  that  our  ministries  will  be  recognised  throughout  the  entire  Catholic  and  Orthodox  Churches.""  It  has  never  been  the  policy  of  the  Church   of  Torres  Strait  to  add  to  the  great  number  of  Christian  Churches  in  the  world  or  in  the  Torres  Strait.  It  has  been  our  policy  and  prayer  from  the  beginning  to  seek  re-union  with  the  wider  Catholic  Church  of  the  West  and  the  Orthodox  Churches  of  the  East  as  they  both  are  part  of  that  one  Church  which  Jesus  Christ  founded.  A  great  step  has  been  taken  with  this  announcement  that  will  change  the  Christian  history.  It  is  perhaps  the  most  important  development  in  the  Christian  history  of  the  forres  Strait  since  the  Coming  of  the  Light.  Over  the  next  few  months,  the  unique  nature  of  the  structure  is  expected  to  be  discussed  in  detail  within  the  TAC  and  what  it  will  mean  for  the  world  and  the  Torres  Strait.  The  Bishop  added  ""Most  importantly,  it  is  a  step  towards  fulfilling  the  prayer  of  the  Son  of  (iod  (John  17)  'That  they  may  be  one'  (John  17:  11,  21-  23).  After  all,  I  repeat,  He  founded  only  one  Church.  I  hope  that  this  will  be  seen  as  an  invitation  to  Christians  of  all  churches  in  the  Torres  Strait  to  fulfil  our  Lord's  Prayer,  and  ""shine  as  a  light  in  the  world  to  the  glory  of  (iod  the  Father""  in  the  words  of  an  old  Torres  Strait  prayer.

TLBG  6  CO  Lt-Col  Dave  Smith  said  the  occasion  was  an  oppor  tunity  for  the  three  forc  es  to  interact  informally.  ""A  day  like  today  promotes  healthy  compe  tition.

"  Helping  refuge   By  W02  Graham  McBean   '  RESERVISTS  on  Rotation  18  (R18)  of  Operation  Anode  put  their  j  ,  skills  from  civilian  life  to  good  use  -  during  a  civilian-military  liaison   (CML)  task  near  Honiara.  The  soldiers  volunteered..-  their  downtime  to  assist'  Tenaru  Women's  .  Refuge  with  its  ongoing  maintenance  .  effort.  It  was  a  joint  effort  by  Australian  Cpl  Craig  Peet  and  NZ  Pte  Byron  Glover,  both  cabinet  makers,  ably  supported  by  Kiwi  handyman  Sgt  Brian  King.  Cpl  Peet,  R18  transport  supervi  sor,  said  the  refuge  was  a  church-run  organisation  staffed  by  Christian  sis  ters  and  all  for  a  good  cause.  ""Money  is  fairly  scarce  here  and  building  products  costs  money,""  Cpl  Peet  said.  ,  ""It  only  costs  us  our  time  and  we've  already  got  the  materials  -  so  why  not.""  .  The  trio  replaced  more  than  12  steps  and  porch  boards  on  an  exter  nal  staircase  which  termites  and  the  weather  had  made  unusable.  Cpl  Peet  said  it  was  an  ongoing  problem  in  Solomon  Islands  where  lack  of  money  for  maintenance  and  a  shortage  of  trade  skills  added  to  the  burden  on  infrastructure.  ""I  am  pleased  to  be  able  to  do  something  and  this  is  important  and  we  can  do  it  ourselves,""  he  said.  The  assistance  to  the  refuge  is  part  of  the  CML  effort  provided  to   the  Regional  Assistance  Mission  to  Solomon  Islands  (RAMSI)  from  the  Op  Anode  rotations.  2IC  CML  Team  W02  Marina  Cox  said  the  liaison  program  was  an  important  part  of  getting  the  right   information  to  the  local  people  on  what  RAMSI  was  about.  ""It  is  very  confronting  to  work  in  this  environment.  So  much  money  is  needed  to  fix  things  up,""  W02  Cox  said.

"  DEIDREE  WHAP:  The  search  for  the  perfect  job   When  you  think  of  human  fixtures  on  T.I.,  Deidree  Whap  springs  to  mind.  She  in  often  seen,  smiling,  from  behind  the  wheel  of  the  ambulance  or  walking  around  town.  Deidree  is  a  quitely  spoken  and  modest  woman  whose  passion  for  her  people,  job  and  family  is  most  evident.  She  has  just  clocked  up  20  years  with  Queensland  Ambulance  Service  or  the  Ambos  as  they  are  known  on  TI  and  presently  works  as  a  Advanced  Care  Paramedic  Deidree  is  attached  to  her  island  home  and  her  people  and  says  she  can't  imagine  leaving,  She  lived  on  the  mainland  lor  some  years  and  says  that  she  ""never  felt  at  home"".  She  attended  All  Souls  St  Gabriel  School  at  Charters  Towers  11  grades  11  and  12.  ""The  high  school  on  TI  only  went  to  grade  10  so  boarding  school  was  only  way  to  finish  senior.""  she  says  ""Even  though  there  were  girls  from  TI  there,  it  was  hard  fitting  in.""  It  was  not  only  a  case  of  cultural  shock  but  also  educational  shock,  Deidree  went  from  attending  a  simple  English  class  to  suddenly  studing  three  English  subjects,  Modem,  Expressive  and  literature.  However,  she  found  the  Christian  discipline  familiar  and  grounding.  ""It  would  have  been  easier  if  I  had  been  a  little  aware  of  the  outside  world  before  we  went  down.  There  was  nothing  at  Charters  Towers  that   resembled  the  Torres  Strait.  The  landscape  was  completely  different  and  I  missed  the  sea  and  my  family  dreadfully,""   Alter  repeating  the  grades  11  and  12  on  Tl  (senior  had  just  been  offered),  Deidree  spent  two  years  studying  a  Diploma  of  Applied  Science/Museology  in  Canberra,  so  keen  was  she  to  experience  life  in  another  state.  ""It  was  cold  and  wet  and  spread  out  and  it  was  such  a  long  way  to  travel  home  tor  semester  breaks,""  says  Deidree  ""It  was  work,  home,  work,  home  and  still  I  missed  TI.""  Fortunately,  Benny  and  Yvonne  Mills  and  Father  Michael  and  Sissy  Cathy  Martin  (parents  of  Michelle  and  George)  were  there  and  Deidree  spent  weekends  with  kindred  spirits.  TI  called  Deidree  back  home  and  she  returned  for  good.   She  was  accepted  into  James  Cook  University  in  Townsville  to  study  teaching  but  she  stayed  to  care  for  her  grandmother.  She  also  tried  her  hand  as  a  teacher  aide  and  at  the  mine  on  Horn  Island  since  she  was  not  sure  about  a  career  choice.  However,  at  the  time,  the  QATB  were  recruiting  Aboriginal  and  islander  staff  and  Deidree's  interest  was  piqued.  She  intially  joined  as  ail  honorary  member,  being  inspired  by  the  late  Debbie  Williams,  ""Every  Wednesday,  I  would  work,  helping  with  call-outs,  Fitting  the  oxygen,  readying  the  stretcher.  Gradually  I  was  given  more  and  more  things  to  do  and  I  became  more  and  more  interested.""  When  a  student  program  was  offered,  Deidree  took  the  plunge  with  fellow  student,  Nancy  Gamia  (nee  Lui),  and  has  never  looked  back  even  though  she  says  she  entered  the  service  by  the  hardest  and  longest  way  Her  island  lifestyle  would  continue  to  influence  her  job.  ""Years  ago,  my  first  job  relieving  at  Bamaga  involved  meeting  a  patient  halfway  along  the  road  to  the  Jardine  River,  only  a  half  hour  drive.  It  was  such  a  long  drive  for  me  who'd  only  driven  on  TI  that  I  nearly  fell  asleep.""  ""What  I  love  best  about  my   job  is  being  able  to  help  and  care  for  my  people.  Caring  is  part  of  my  inner  nature  and  I  am  lucky  to  be  working  in  this  field.""  More  to  the  point,  the  QAS  is  extremely  lucky  to  have  someone  like  Deidree  on  the  ground.  Having  an  Islander  who  is  able  to  communicate  with  other  Islanders  is  important.  Deidree  interprets  for  other  ambulance  officers  since  she  speaks  Creole,  Western  language  and  can  at  least  understand  a  patient  speaking  Eastern  language.  Deidree  is  the  oldest  of  six  children  to  mother  Penina  who  has  passed  away.  So  it  is  no  wonder  Deidree  takes  in  her  stride  a  roster  of  8  days  on/6  days  off,  emergency  helicopter  call-outs  to  the  outer  islands  at  all  hours  and  being  mother  to  Penina,  17,  and  Catherine,  10.  Plus,  she  cares  for  her  nephews,  17   and  13,  and  neice,  16,  from  Mabuiag  who  attend  the  TI  high  school.  Deidree  is  remarkably  calm  about  living  with  five  kids  in  a  three-  bedroom  unit  and  dealing  with  housework.  ""Last  year  we  had  three  rosters  which  didn't  work.  I  am  not  stressing  about  things,""  she  says.  ""If  they  don't  make  their  lunch  and  then  are  starving  at  school,  I  just  say,  'it's  not  my  problem'.'  She  says  the  family  had  a  quiet  Christian  Easter  that  wasn't  focused  on  chocolate  and  days  off  school.  Deidree  is  not  sure  what  the  future  holds  but  says  she'd  would  like  to  work  as  a  cross-cultural  trainer  if  the  opportunity  arises.  Deidree  has  no  plans  to  leave  Tl  for  she  loves  her  island  home;  the  laid  back  lifestyle,  her  family,  the  friendly  community  and  the  sea.  Which  is  just  fine  for  us  and  the  Ambos!   Deidree  Whap  and  family  members  with  her  20  years  service  award. ",2009-05-13

Bible-based  encouragement  was  given  to  help  families  stay  spiritually  alert  to  dangers  that  threaten  their  future   happiness,  while  practical  advice  was  given  to  help  families  preserve  unity  in  matters  of  worship  and  their  relationship  w  ith  (jod.  ""Help  People  to  'Awake  From  Sleep""  was  based  on  the  passage  at  Romans  13:11  and  showed  the  importance  of  avoiding  spiritual  apathy.  It  emphasised  why  Jehovah's  Witnesses  feel  the  need  to  intensify  their  efforts  m  the  public  ministry,  an   activity  for  which  they  are  well-known.  ""Your  Brother  Was  Dead  and  Came  to  Life""  was  the  title  of  a  modemday  drama,  based  on  Jesus'  famous  parable  of  the  prodigal  son,  recorded  at  Luke  15:11-32.  ""The  theme  was  excellent  for  helping  us  to  see  the  need  to  stay  spiritually  awake.""  remarked  Greg  I  layden,  one  of  the  convention's  organisers.  We  really  need  to  pay  attention  to  tie  meaning  behind  the  events  happening  in  the  world  today  and  live  our  lives  accordingly.""  At  the  conclusion,  the  audience  broke  out  in  spontaneous  prolonged  applause  and  gave  evidence  of  being  determined  to  follow  through  with  the  urgent  appeals.

"  Catholics  try  to  make  dude  feel  guilty   DEAR  EDITORS,  Last  holidays,  during  a  3  hour  drive  across  the  mountains  with  my  friends,  I  found  myself  in  a  lengthy  discussion  about  the  modern  relevance  and  necessity  of  religious  practices  and  beliefs,  particularly  as  a  means  of  giving  children  a  healthy  moral  upbringing,  and  whether  it  has  any  place  in  politics,  national  policy,  schools  etc.  As  outrageous  and  heated  as  the  conservation  became  between  me  (a  couldn't-find-religion-to-be-a-bigger-wasteof-time  kinda  guy)  and  my  three  Catholic-raised  friends,  I  would  like  to  focus  on  the  one  ultimately  irritating  question  I  was  asked  at  one  point.  The  question  was,  ""then  what  do  you  believe?""  Before  exploring  this  question  any  further  I  would  like  to  point  out  that  while  I  thought  the  question  was  both  loaded  and  a  waste  of  time,  the  asker  felt  as  if  he  was  exposing  some  small  kind  of  emptiness  or  hole  in  my  life  because  I  don't  choose  to  select  some  spiritual  entity  to  give  purpose,  cause  and  explanation  to  myself,  others  and  the  world  around  me.  The  stupid  thing  about  this  is  that  he  felt  as  if  his  answer  to  the  same  question  was  automatically  covered  by  the  value  system  of  his  Catholic  upbringing.  But  this  doesn't  tell  you  squat  about  who  he  really  is.  One  of  my  ""married  into  the  family""  uncles  strongly  subscribes  to  his  Christian  beliefs  but  would  rather  spend  his  only  spare  cash  on  a  new  motor  for  a  bike  he  never  rides  than  get  his  young  daughters  some  Christmas  presents  so  that  they  don't  end  up  coming  from  St  Vinnies'  like  last  year.  A  far  better  description  of  what  he  believes  and  who  he  is,  is  that  he  is  a  complete  dumbshit  conspiracy  nut  who  believes  in  all  kinds  of  retarded  Jewish  new  world  order  and  government  plots.  As  for  myself,  I  truly  enjoy  studying  in  the  mathematics  honours  program,  playing  basketball  and  squash  on  the  weekends  with  my  friends,  going  carp  fishing  with  my  brothers;  I  truly  love  my  family  and  girlfriend,  and  wholeheartedly  wish  that  everyone  on  Earth  could  live  the  love-filled,  comfortable  and  opportunity  rich  lifestyles  that  you  and  I  have  had  the  privilege  of  experiencing.

Les  dix  cabinets  internationaux  d'architectes  et  d'urbanistes,  chargés  par  le  ministèrefrançais  de  la  Culture  et  de  la  Communication  de  travailler  sur  ce  vaste  sujet,  on  présenté  leurs  projets  de  modernisation  au  Conseil  économi  que  et  social.  On  y  trouve  de  grands  noms  de  l'architecture,  parmi  lesquels  Jean  Nouvel  et  Christian  de  Portzamparc.  To  les  projets  tournent  autour  de  trois  grands  thèmes  :  le  dévelop  pement  durable  après  le  protocole  de  Kyoto,  la  réorganisation  du  réseau  de  transports  et  le  désenclavement  des  banlieues.   Comment  réaménager  la  grande  agglomération  parisienne  ?  Qu'est-ce  qu'une  grande  métropole  du  XXIè  siècle  ?  Comment  concilier  écologie  et  croissance  ?  Quel  sera  le  nouveau  visage  de  Paris  ?  Telles  sont  les  questions  auxquelles  ont  répondu  les  dix  cabinets  d'architecture  (six  français,  quatre  étrangers)  pour  faire  de  Paris  une  ville  ouverte  sur  le  monde,  dynamique,  compétitive  et  attractive...  Lancé  au  début  de  l'année  2008,  ce  projet  d'exception  a  été  placé  sous  l'autorité  d'un  Comité  de  pilotage  composé  de  l'Etat,  de  la  ville  de  Paris,  de  la  Région  Ile-de-France  et  de  l'Association  des  maires  d'Ile-de-France,  assisté  d'un  Comité  scientifique  réunissant  23  personnalités  qualifiées.  La  coordination  générale  de  la  consultation  a  été  confiée  par  le  président  de  la  République  au  ministère  de   la  Culture  et  de  la  Communication.  Quinze  millions  d'habitants  sont  concernés.  Les  experts  s'inspirent  de  la  situation  actuelle,  celle  d'un  urbanisme  insatiable  qu'il  faut  canaliser,  et  d'un  réseau  de  transports  qu'il  faut  réorganiser.  Ils  inscrivent  leurs  réflexions  dans  le  contexte  environnemental  de  la  métropole  après  le  protocole  de  Kyoto.  Moins  de  temps  de  transport,  et  davantage  de  contact  avec  la  nature,  plus  d'équilibre  entre  la  nature  et  le  milieu  urbain  :  telles  sont  les  priorités.  «  Nous  devons  inventer  un  art  de  vivre  dans  le  Grand  Paris.  Il  faut  que  l'on  puisse  dire  qu  'ily  a  quelque  chose  d'original  à  Paris,  soit  dans  la  façon  de  se  loger,  soit  dans  la  façon  de  se  déplacer.  Nous  devons,  tout  simplement,  jeter  les  bases  d'un  art  de  vivre  ensemble»,  indique  le  secrétaire  d'Etat  au  Développement  de  la  Région,  estimant  que  ce  sont  des  villes  comme  Paris,  New  York,  Londres,  ou  Tokyo  qui  favoriseront  la  croissance  de  demain.  Mais  pour  aller  chercher  cette  croissance,  il  faudra  tout  d'abord  organiser  davantage  l'accessibilité  aux  zones  d'activité  grâce  à  l'inter  modalité  des  transports  :  aéroports,  gares  TGV  etc.  Accroître  la  visibilité  et  la  notoriété  des  zones  de  développement  économique  constitue  un  autre  objectif  des  responsables  de  cet   ce  à  t  -  us  -  important  projet.  Citons  à  cet  égard  la  ville  d'Evry,  dans  le  sud  de  Paris,  qui  abrite  50  à  60  %  de  l'industrie  pharmaceutique  française,  Plaine  Commune,  à  Saint-Denis,  pour  la  création  artistique,  ou  bien  encore  l'université  Descartes,  à  Saclay,  qui  accueille  1.200  chercheurs.  Parmi  les  dix  projets  du  Grand  Paris  présentés  par  les  architectes  et  les  urbanistes,  on  peut  notamment  observer  leur  volonté  d'imaginer  une  nouvelle  identité  régionale,  ainsi  que  la  nécessité  de  favoriser  la  continuité  entre  la  capitale  et  sa  banlieue.  Pour  Christian  de  Portzamparc,  il  s'agit  surtout  de  lutter  contre  l'enclavement.  Les  pôles  doivent  s'interconnecter,  mêler  commerces,  bureaux  et  logements.  Celui-ci  propose  un  train  aérien,  léger  et   des  boulevards  périphériques.  Afin  de  desservir  les  métropoles  nord-européennes,  il  envisage  également  la  création  d'une  nouvelle  grande  gare  ferroviaire  qui  se  substituerait  aux  gares  du  Nord  et  de  l'Est.  Jean  Nouvel,  quant  à  lui,  propose  des  tours  et  des  terrasses  qui  seraient  des  interprétations  des  monuments  historiques,  autour  de  zones  peu  denses  comme  Gennevilliers  avec  son  port,  La  Courneuve  et  son  parc...  «Le  changement  d'époque  que  nous  vivons  s'accompagne  d'un  changement  de  modèle  de  développement»,  remarque-t-il.  Pour  exalter  davantage  encore  le  charme  de  Paris,  il  utilise  ce  qui  existe  déjà,  l'embellit  et  y  intègre  le  monde  végétal.  Roland  Castro,  pour  sa  part,  estime  que  le  rayonnement  mondial  de  Paris  est  tout  particulièrement  lié  à  sa  beauté.  En  conséquence,  il  veut  embellir  les  banlieues,  créer  un  opéra  au  port   de  Gennevilliers,  et  un  quartier  d'affaires  à  Vitry,  sur  une  île  artificielle.  Il  fait  de  la  métropole  une  immense  fleur  à  huit  pétales,  avec  des  lieux  symboliques  du  métissage,  de  la  culture,  des  sciences.  Antoine  Grumbach  imagine  une  agglomération  allant  jusqu'au  Havre,  en  créant  une  vallée  de  la  Seine.  Il  fait  notamment  valoir  que  «Paris  doit  se  projeter  dans  la  très  grande  échelle  de  la  mondialisation,  dont  le  transport  maritime  est  l'épine  dorsale.  Toutes  les  grandes  métropoles  internationales  sont  portuaires.  Il  faut  réconcilier  l'intensité  urbaine  et  la  proximité  de  la  nature».  Les  projets  étrangers  ne  sont  pas  en  reste.  L'architecte  hollandais  Winy  Maas  préconise  un  recentrage  de  la  capitale,  pose  des  panneaux  solaires  sur  les  toits,  agrandit  Roissy  et  l'entoure  de  forêts.  Le  cabinet  allemand  de  Finn  Geipel  alterne  ville  «intense»  très  dense  et  équipée,  et  ville  «légère»  et  flexible.  Les  Italiens  Bernardo  Secchi  et  Paola  Vigano  veulent  une  ville  «poreuse»,  qui  donne  une  large  place  au  réseau  fluvial.  L'architecte  britannique  Richard  Rogers  s'appuie  sur  l'idée  d'une  restructuration  de  la  gouvernance  de  l'Ile-de-France,  avec  des  quartiers  équilibrés,  et  une  bonne  mixité  entre  riches  et  pauvres.  «En  dix  ans,  on  peut  avoir  une  ville  sans  automobiles  polluantes»,  observe  l'architecte,   qui  veut  «intégrer  la  nature»  dans  la  ville,  en  utilisant  les  400  km2  de  toitures  comme  espaces  verts.  Une  exposition  de  maquettes  du  projet  sera  présentée  à  la  Cité  de  l'architecture  et  du  patrimoine,  à  partir  du  29  avril  et  jusqu'au  22  novembre  2009.  Il  restera  ensuite  à  prendre  les  bonnes  décisions...

"  Riding  In  Buses  with  Heretics   THE  ATHEIST  BUS  GETS  REJECTED  IN  CAMPAIGN  AUSTRALIA   IMAGE  MITCH  SPIDER   WORDS  LAURENA  BASUTU   In  recent  months  British  buses  have  hit  the  streets  in  the  first  ever  national  athiest  advertising  campaign  sporting  slogans  such  as  ""There's  probably  no  God.  Now  stop  worrying  and  enjoy  your  life"".  This  action,  according  to  Ariane  Sherine  (comedienne  and  journalist  for  the  Guardian  in  London),  was  designed  to  ""counter  religious  advertising  ""  which  has  been  known  to  promise  the  non  Christian  ""all  eternity  in  torment  in  hell"",  whilst  being  incinerated  in  ""a  lake  of  fire"".  A  similar  athiest  campaign  has  spread  to  other  countries  and  was  proposed  to  advertising  company  'APN  Outdoor'  by  the  Australian  Athiest  foundation  (AAF).  $16000  was  provided  for  the  bus  ads,  various  slogans  were  provided,  but  the  idea  was  knocked  back.  No  reason  was  cited  for  this  refusal.  The  APN's  refusal  to  run  the  atheist  ads  throws  many  questions  into  the  boxing  ring  that  is  the  religion  debate,  and  casts  a  shadow  over  the  idea  of  free  speech.  As  Australia  does  not  have  a  comprehensive  Human  Rights  and  Opportunities  Act,  it  must  be  up  to  society  to  decide  whether  APN  superseded  the  public's  right  to  offend  and  be  offended  by  the  ads.  However,  all  Australian  states  do  have  anti  vilification  laws  which  prohibit  public  acts  of  vilification,  verbal  abuse  and  hatred,  on  a  range  of  grounds  including  race  and  religion.  These  laws  state  that  it  is  unlawful  to,  by  a  public  act,  to  incite  hatred  towards,  serious  contempt  for,  or  severe  ridicule  of,  a  person  or  group  of  persons  on  the  ground  of  their  race,  homosexuality,  HIV/AIDS  status,  transgender  status,  or  religion.  Therefore  APN  could  argue  that  it  was  safe  guarding  itself  from  legal  action  by  avoiding  statements  that  may  exhibit  a  form  of  serious  contempt  towards  Christians  and  other  formal  religions.  For  me  this  argument  does  not  hold  any  credence,  must  society  step  all  over  freedom  of  speech  because  there  is  a  chance  that  'someone'  might  be  offended?  I  believe  that  APN  Outdoor   acted  outside  its  bounds  as  a  private  organisation  by  censoring  the  ads.  Why  can't  the  Atheist  Foundation  of  Australia  be  allowed  the  equal  opportunity  to  espouse  their  own  beliefs  if  buses  in  Adelaide  can  swish  by  bearing  the  sign  ""John  3:16""  surreptitiously  reminding  the  huddled  masses  that  ""God  so  loved  the  world,  that  he  gave  his  only  begotten  Son,  that  whosoever  believeth  in  him  should  not  perish,  but  have  everlasting  life"".  The  same  passenger  being  confronted  with  Christianity  can  therefore  also  be  asked  to  ""celebrate  reason""  and  ""sleep  in  on  Sunday  mornings"".  They  should  be  allowed  to  know,  as  Richard  Nicholls  puts  it,  that  ""there  is  an  alternative  to  religion  that  is  rational  and  worthy  of  thought"".  Although  religion  is  an  important  part  of  the  Australian  landscape  and  its  opinions  cannot  be  ignored,  atheism  is  also  a  significant  part  of  the  social  terrain  and   perhaps  they  too  would  like  the  opportunity  to  proselytise.  The  AAF  admits  that  it  seeks  to  promote  its  own  morals  and  identity  by  using  the  same  sensationalist  preaching  that  is  practiced  by  the  monotheistic.  It,  too,  is  trying  to  gather  a  flock,  to  herd  the  lost  lambs  onto  the  path  of  righteousness  and  lead  them  to  the  promised  land  (wherever  that  may  be).  The  AAF  has  a  point.  Maybe  a  little  competition  in  spiritual  advertising  is  a  good  thing.  Surely  the  foundations  of  conventional  religion  are  secure  enough  to  withstand  the  questioning  of  inquiring  minds.  So  imagine  if  the  ads  were  to  be  run.  How  would  the  situation  unfold?  The  ads  are  slapped  on  the  sides  of  buses  everywhere,  and  perhaps  a  massive  backlash  from  religious  leaders  would  ensue.  At  the  same  time,  a  certain  sector  of  the  public  would  respond  in  favour  of  the  ads,  both  religious  and  atheist  ""because  you  have  to  respect  others  choices  blah  blah  blah"".  The  divide  in  opinion  would  spark  a  renewed  interest  scientific  theories  which  either  prove  or  disprove  the  existence  of  a  God.  Though  the  debate  would  be  stimulating,  it  would  end  one  of  two  ways.  The  public  would  either  ignore  it,  or  inundate  the  Independent  Advertising  Standards  Bureau  with  complaints,  and  just  like  those  'longer  lasting  sex'  ads  the  plug  would  be  pulled.  So  perhaps  APN  Outdoor  did  us  a  service  and  saved  us  a  lot  of  pointless  hassle.  eyond  the  issues  of  censorship  and  freedom  of  speech,  these  ads  bring  forward  another  issue  -  the  idea  that  religions  should  be  subject  to  critical  examination  like  other  ideas.  Richard  Robinson  Bargues  in  'An  Atheist's  Values'  that  ""Religion  is  gravely  infected  with  intellectual  dishonesty...  [that]  in  religion  it  is  particularly  easy  to  escape  notice,  because  of  the  common  assumption  that  all  honesty  flows  from  religion.""  But  who  cares  about  truth  if  the  no  one  is  hurt?  Why  not  join  a  church?  Why  not  revel  in  the  comfort  and  security  that  knowing  that  somewhere  out  there  you  have  what  Bertrand  Russell  calls  in  'Why  I  am  Not  a  Christian',  ""a  kind  of  elder  brother  who  will  stand  by  you  in  all  your  troubles.""  Our  beliefs  offer  us  a  safe  haven,  a  place  to  go  when  we  are  afraid,  and  if  going  to  Sunday  mass,  praying  to  Allah,  practicing  atheism  or  prostrating  ourselves  to  our  ancestors'  spirits  offers  a  sense  of  personal  security,  then  that's  okay.  In  the  end,  the  controversy  surrounding  the  AAF's  ads  has  no  significance,  they  will  probably  never  see  the  light  of  day.  The  real  issue  here  is  freedom  of  speech  and  ultimately  our  right  to  choose.  These  are  the  basic  rights  of  the  individual.  APN  outdoor  has  stripped  us  of  this  opportunity  and  presented  atheism  as  somehow  illegitimate,  and  has  therefore  undermined  the  notion  that  everyone  can  believe  in  whoever  or  whatever  they  want,  whenever  they  want  to.  #   The  same  pagsenigaf  being  eonffontaci  with  Christianity  can  therefore  also  be  asked  to  celebrate  reason*  1  and  &amp;lt;s  sls@p  in  on  Sunday  ruerningg ",2009-03-06
"  816  Sqn's  home  away  from  home   By  SBLT  Matthew  Shipton   TWO  thousand  residents  of  the  City  of  Caloundra  turned  out  to  watch  more  than  100  members  of  816  Squadron  exercise  the  right  of   Freedom  of  Entry  to  their  city  on  October  31.  The  Squadron  was  first  linked  with  the  City  of  Caloundra  in  1996  and,  after  a  change  of  borders  arid  redistribution,  a  'Friendship  &gt;  Agreement'  was  formed  to  forfnal-  ly  recognise  the  adoption  of  816  Squadron  by  the  Sunshine  Coast  Regional  Council.  Two  days  before  the  beginning  of  the  late  October  parade,  two  Seahawks  -flew  north  to  begin  a  round  of  school  visits  while  other  personnel  covered  the  1400km  jour  ney  by  coach.  Sunshirie  Christian  College  and  Sunshine  Beach  State  High  School  were  visited  by  one  Seahawk  while  Sunshine  Coast  Grammar  School  and  Maleny  State  High  School  were  visited  by  the  other.  On  the  day  of  the  march  one  Seahawk  landed  in  King's  Park  to  act  as  a  static  display  while  the  other,  flown  by  LEUTs  Andrew  Rohrsheim  and  Marcelo  Lagos  and  crewed  by  WOA  Brian  Pashley,  provided  a  fly  ing  and  winching  demonstration.  ,  Led  by  CO  CMDR  Chris  Smallhorn,  the  Squadron  marched  around  King's  Park  to  be  met  with  the  traditional  challenge,  ""Identify  yourselves  and  state  by  what  right  you  enter  and  use  the  township  of  Caloundra,""  which  was  delivered  by  local  Police  Inspector  Mark  Henderson.  ...  After  CMDR  Smallhorn  replied,   ""816  Squadron  exercising  its  right  and  privilege  -to  pass  through  the  township  of  Caloundra  with  swords  drawn,  drums  beating,  band  play  ing  and  colours  flying,""  Inspector  Henderson  was  satisfied  that  the  scroll  was  in  order  and  allowed  the  parade  to  proceed.  CMDR  Smallhorn  said  the  FOE  was  a  great  honour  and  an  exciting  time  for  his  Squadron.  ""An  FOE  is  recognised  as  the  single  greatest  honour  a  town  or  city  can  bestow  upon  a  military  unit  and,  coupled  with  the  experience  of  a  centuries  old  tradition,  it  is  hard  not  to  become  wrapped  up  in  the  event,""  he  said.  -   CMDR  Smallhorn  said  mem  bers  of  816  Squadron  visted  the  area  .  at  least  once  a  year,  but  especial  ly  on  Anzac  Day  where  personnel  marched  and  the  CO  was  the  key  note  speaker.  ""Each  time  we  visit  we  also  use  the  flight  hours  to  and  from  Caloundra  as  Seahawk  conversion  and  currency  training  for  our  air  crew.""  With  the  parade  and  festivities  finished,  CMDR  Smallhorn  summed  up  events.  ""This  is  our  home,  away  from  home,""  he  said.

It  is  the  privilege  of  every  Christian  to  rejoice  in  the  Good  News.  We  are  to  build  our  lives  on  that  CkkkI  News  and  to  share  it  with  those  who  haw  not  heard  about  Jesus  or  accepted  him  as  their  personal  Sa\  lour.   Just  an  example,  if  we  tike  the  example  of  a  tree,  w  e  w  ill  be  able  to  understand  the  relationship  between  faith  and  works.

They  are  still  trusting  in  their  own  w  ork  to  save  them,  rather  than  in  God's  work.  (Romans  4:4-5).  True  good  works  are  not  for  our  own  good,  but  for  the  good  of  others,  and  show  our  love  for  God.  (John   14:  2D.  To  lea\e  the  message  v\  uh  &gt;  ou.

"  A  life  outside  of  Facebook   BY  DHANU  ELIEZER   As  the  dependence  and  addiction  to  social  networking  website  Facebook  grows  among  young  and  old^ahke,  one  girl  keeps  her  distance  and  lives  content  without  it.  Meet  Nicota  Hicks:  a  typical  18-year-old  girt  who  likes  hanging  out  with  friends,  playing  sports  and  being  among  people.  Growing  up  on  a  farm  in  Dubbo,  Central  New  South  Wales,  Hicks  attended  Dubbo  Christian  School  from  kindergarten  to  Year  12,  as  did  most  of  her  friends.  After  graduating  last  year,  Hicks  moved  to  Sydney  to  study  Medicine  at  the  University  of  New  South  Wales  while  her  friends  now  attend  universities  across  Australia.  Despite  the  distance  between  them,  Hicks  still  keeps  in  touch  with  her  friends  regularly,  but  not  through  the  popular  mode  of  communication,  Facebook.  Instead,  Hicks  prefers  to  write  letters  and  use  the  phone.  In  fact,  unlike  most  teenagers,  Hicks  doesn't  even  have  a  Facebook  account.  ""What's  the  point?  That's  just  silly;  I  have  a  phone  for  communication,  i  like  to  talk  to  people  face-toface,  if  not  then  phoning  is  the  next  option.  Texting  and  email  are  my  least  favourite,  though  I  use  them  regularly,""  she  says.  When  she  was  in  Year  9,  Hicks  travelled  to  Japan  with  her  school  and  stayed  in  the  home  of  two  Japanese  girls.  For  over  a  year,  the  three  kept  in  contact  through  letters  and  parcels  -  not  email.  ""I  guess  a  part  of  me  likes  traditional  stuff,""  she  says.  ""I  prefer  to  write  letters,  the  joy  of  feeling  like  I'm  talking  to  someone  when  I  write  a  letter.""  Hicks  also  realises  the  distraction  that  Facebook  presents  to  its  users  and  sees  herself  avoiding  this.  ""It  is  a  distraction,  and  by  not  having  it  I'm  not  tempting  myself.  I  get  distracted  just  by  checking  my  email.""  she  says,  ""f  know  that  when  I  log  on  to  my  email  account,  I  always  get  excited  hoping  I've  got  a  new  email!""  Instead  of  spending  time  on  the  internet,  Hicks  is  able  to  spend  more  time  running  and  playing  the  sports  she  enjoys.  She  believes  the  fact  that  she  doesn't  constantly  spend  time  on  the  internet  and  'check  up'  on  her  friends  on  Facebook  makes  her  value  the  conversations  and  the  time  she  spends  with  them  even  more.  However,  in  a  world  where  business  relies  on  communication  through  the  internet,  Hicks  finds  herself  being  drawn  into  the  cyberworld.  ""Here  at  uni,  email  is  the  form  of  communication  with  the  uni.  I  am  constantly  checking  my  student  email  address  to  try  and  be  up  to  date  and  so  at  the  same  time  I  check  my  hotmail.""  With  the  pressure  from  her  friends  to  get  a  Facebook  account  and  the  reliance  on  email  for  communication,  Hicks  feels  she  will  soon  be  living  in  cyberspace  like  almost  everyone  else.

"  JACQUES  CHIRAC,  L'ADOLESCENT  QUI  RÊVAIT  D'APPRENDRE  LE  SANSCRIT   De  l'adolescent  qui  voulait  apprendre  le  sanscrit  au  présidentfasciné  par  les  vieilles  cultures  une  passion  constante  habite  Jacques  Chirac:  le  respect  des  civilisations  et  le  refus  de  l'eurocen  trisme.  C'est  ce  que  montre  l'émission  ""A  visage  découvert""  diffusée  sur  France  5.   Conduite  par  les  journalistes  Christian  Malard  et  Bernard  Vaillot  avec  un  a  priori  très  positif,  cette  enquête  omet  aussi  de  parler  des  drames  personnels,  des  amitiés  et  inimitiés.  Elle  explore  les  préoccupations  profondes  d'un  homme  dont  la  cote  de  popularité  atteint,  à  76  ans,  deux  ans  après  son  départ  de  l'Elysée,  74%  d'opinions  favorables.  Son  biographe  Pierre  Péan  observe  que  Chirac  n'était  pas  mécontent  d'être  réputé  pour  des  goûts  simples  -de  la  tête  de  veau  aux  romans  policiers-  afin  de  mieux  préserver  ""son  jardin  secret  à  l'abri  du  regard  des  autres"".  Adolescent,  le  futur  président  essaiera  d'apprendre  le  sanscrit  et  sera  séduit  par  les  arts  asiatiques  au  Musée  Guimet,  manière  aussi  de  rompre  avec  son  milieu.  Cet  homme  profondément  laïque,  ""pudique""  voire  secret,  qui  se  méfie  des  étiquettes  de  droite  et  de  gauche,  va  préférer  les  contacts  directs  aux  ors  des  palais.  Quand  Georges  Pompidou  l'exhorte  en  1966  à  se  présenter  à  la  députation  à  Paris,  il  ira  plutôt  faire  campagne  auprès  des  paysans  rudes  de  Corrèze.  De  même  il  aimera  le  contact  avec  les  foules  africaines,  qui  l'adopteront.  Ce  portrait  décrit  un  homme  ayant  choisi  la  haute  administration,  sans  doute  sous  injonction  paternelle,  mais  dont  l'inclinaison  le  portait  au  voyage  au  long  cours,  à  la  plongée  dans  les  mondes  inconnus.  Jacques  Chirac  refuse  toute  conception  eurocentriste.  Il  n'existe  pas  selon  lui  de  hiérarchie  de  cultures  et  de  peuples.  Il  l'a  exprimé  dans  son  Musée  des  Arts  premiers  ouvert  en  2006,  destiné  à  montrer  des  ""expressions  admirables  souvent  ignorées"".  Pour  l'ancien  ministre  des  Affaires  étrangères  Philippe  Douste-Blazy,  le  message  de  Chirac  est  qu'""on  ne  juge  pas  une  civilisation  à  court  terme,  mais  à  long  terme"".  Interrogé  sur  le  discours  de  Nicolas  Sarkozy  le  26  juillet  2007  à  Dakar,  selon  qui  l'être  africain  ""n'est  pas  assez  entré  dans  l'Histoire"",  Jacques  Chirac  répond:  ""l'homme  africain  est  entré  dans  l'Histoire,  il  y  est  même  entré  le  premier.  On  ne  peut  avoir  à  son  égard  que  du  respect,  le  respect  que  l'on  a  pour   un  ancêtre  commun"".  A  l'ancien  chancelier  Gerhard  Schroder,  Chirac  dira  son  souci  de  ""ne  pas  laisser  le  passé  influencer  le  présent  de  manière  négative"".  ""Il  pensait  que  l'Allemagne  avait  une  attitude  trop  défensive  à  l'égard  de  son  histoire  et  de  ses  possibilités"",  ajoute  Schroder,  reconnaissant  que  Chirac  ne  perçoive  pas  l'Allemagne  seulement  à  travers  le  prisme  du  nazisme.  Pour  la  Chine  et  l'Asie,  l'ancien  président  juge  normal  que  le  pendule  de  l'Histoire  revienne  vers   ces  peuples:  il  y  a  ""un  déplacement  vers  ces  régions  des  centres  de  décision.  C'est  conforme  à  une  certaine  réalité  historique.  C'est  là  que  se  trouvent  les  plus  anciennes  cultures  respectueuses  de  l'Homme"".  Il  se  dit  convaincu  que  la  Chine  ""s'imposera  par  l'exemple,  par  la  force  culturelle,  morale,  pas  par  la  guerre"".  Quant  au  Proche-Orient  lieu  d'intolérance,  Chirac  exprime  un  perceptible  découragement:  ""il  n'y  aura  pas  de  solution  s'il  n'y  a  pas  de  respect  réciproque"",  avertitil,  juifs  comme  arabes.

"  LE  2ÈME  FORUM  FRANCOPHONE  DU  PACIFIQUE   PLACE  AUX  CRÉATEURS...  DE  BANDES  DESSINÉES  !   Devant  le  succès  remporté  par  ces  grands  moments  d'échanges  que  furent  -  d'abord  à  Vanuatu  en  2006  puis  sur  le  Gold,  Coast  en  Australie  en  2007-  les  «  Rencontres  Régionales  »  organisées  par  l'Institut  pour  la  Francophonie  dans  le  Pacifique  (une  O.N.G.  co-présidée  à  Nouméa  avec  le  journaliste  mélanésien  Wallès  Kotra  actuel  directeur  délégué  de  France  O  à  Paris  par  Jean  Claude  Briault,  membre  du  gouvernement  en  charge  du  secteur),  la  Nouvelle-Calédonie  a  pris  l'initiative  en  2008,  on  s'en  souvient,  de  lancer  chez  elle  le  Premier  Forum  Francophone  du  Pacifique...  permettant  ainsi  notamment  aux  responsables  de  trente-six  Alliancesfrançaises  de  la  zone  (.Australie,  Nouvelle-Zélande,  Papouasie,  Fidtfi  et  Vanuatu)  se  réunir  pour  la  premièrejbis  dans  leur  propre  région.   Au  cours  d'un  programme  établi  sur  trois  jours,  très  dense  -  mêlant  la  célébration  du  livre,  la  promotion  du  tourisme  et  des  artisanats  régionaux,  mettant  également  en  scène  la  diversité  culturelle  -  les  responsables  de  ces  Alliances  Françaises  étaient  accompagnés  de  plusieurs  diplomates  francophones  et  francophiles...  mais  aussi  de  représentants  de  Wallis-et-Futuna  et  de  Polynésie  Française.  La  présence  de  Christian  Philip  (représentant  personnel  du  président  de  la   République)  avait  alors  témoigné  du  vif  intérêt  porté  à  cette  manifestation  par  les  plus  hautes  autorités  françaises.  Cette  année,  toujours  à  Nouméa,  du  19  au  24  octobre  dernier,  s'est  donc  tenu  un  Second  Forum  Francophone  qui  aura,  cette  foici,  regroupé  non  seulement  les  Alliances  françaises  du  Pacifique  (21  d'Australie,  3  de  Nouvelle-  Zélande,  les  2  de  Vanuatu  et  même  celle  des  Cook  Islands)  mais  aussi...  deux  Centres  Culturels  d'Asie  (l'un   du  Japon,  l'autre  d'Indonésie).  Avaient  notamment  et  également  été  invités  des...auteurs  francophones  de  bandes  dessinées  d'Australie,  de  Nouvelle-Zélande,  de  Vanuatu,  du  Japon,  de  France  métropolitaine  et  bien  entendu  de  Nouvelle-Calédonie  qui,  pour  leur  part,  ont  notamment  tenu  un  «  salon  régional  »...  tandis  que,  par  ailleurs,  un  séminaire  a  aussi  rassemblé  les  responsables  professionnels  «  Jeunesse  »  des  pays  et  territoires  francophones.  On  relèvera  parmi  les  invités  créateurs  de  bandes  dessinées  l'auteure  de  manga  japonaise  de  Miyao  NEKOYAMA  (nom  connu  d'artiste)  qui  a  notamment  en  préparation  la  publication  d'un  album  français...  chez  un  éditeur  français.  Mais  aussi  l'auteur  néo-zélandais  de  Wellington  Tim  Bolinger  à  l'œuvre  largement  inspirée  d'Hergé  et  qui  a  déjà  en  vingt-cinq  ans  de  carrière  publié  une  quinzaine  de  B.D.  dont  une  en  français  baptisée  :  «  Petit  œil,  apprenti  détective  »...  et  l'auteur  franco-britanique  Nicolas  VADOT  vivant  aujourd'hui  à  Canberra  et  dont  le  dernier  album  «  Neuf  mois  »  vient  de  sortir  aux  éditions  Casternam.   Peut-on  omettre  de  citer  aussi  -  grâce  au  concours  du  club  Soroptimist  -  la  présence  de  Sylvie  ANDRE,  écrivain  de  Polynésie  française  et  professeure  d'université  qui  a  notamment  donné  une  conférence  sur  le  roman  polynésien  ?  De  son  côté,  l'Alliance  Champlain  avait  organisé  un  concours  de  ...  «  calligrammes  »  ouvert  à  tous  les  Calédoniens  et  qui  aura  connu  un  grand  succès.

"  1RTU  at  home  in  Wagga   All  settled  in  after  big  move   By  LAC  Aaron  Curran   NEARLY  a  year  after  the  move  to  RAAF  Base  Wagga,  No.  I  Recruit  Training  Unit  (1RTU)  has  settled  in,  met  its  challenges  and  is  well  placed   for  2009.  With  most  of  the  relocation  issues  ironed  out  and  its  processes  in  place,  1RTU  trained  881  recruits  over  19  courses  last  year.  Former  CO  1RTU  WGCDR  David  Ashworth  said  it  was  a  higher  number  of  recruits  than  2006  and  2007.  ""Running  1  9  courses  was  a  tremen  dous  achievement  by  the  staff  and  dur  ing  that  time  we  gave  the  new  facility  a  good  run  through,""  he  said.  Starting  again  was  the  big  gest  challenge  facing  IRTU's  staff  with  the  unit  being  at  RAAF  Base  Edinburgh  for  40  years.  One  flight  commander  noted  that  with  moving  a  unit  as  large  and  com  plex  as  1RTU,  every  transaction  from  issuing  a  bit  of  kit,  meals  required  out  of  hours,  specialist  medical  appointments  or  dental  parades  took  a  lot  longer  compared  to  Edinburgh,  where  processes  as  simple  as  those  had  been  in  place  for  many  years.  ""The  staff  carried  that  burden,  anil  by  the  end  of  2008,  with  the  help  of  many  others  at  Wagga,  they  had  ironed  out  the  wrinkles  and  got  those  transac  tion  times  down  to  where  we  were  ai  Edinburgh,""  WGCDR  Ashworth  said.  Throughout  the  move,  the  staff  threw  all  the  cards  in  the  air  and  re  wrote  the  training  program.  The  cur  riculum  has  been  brought  up-to-date  lo  ensure  its  relevance  to  a  whole  range  of  subject  areas  that  Air  Force  and  Defence  require.  The  limited  space  available  at  Wagga  presented  the  Military  Skills  Instructors  (MSI)  with  a  challenge  when  it  came  to  drill.  MSI  CPL  Bailey  Baker  said  Edinburgh  had  more  space  to  consoli-   date  drill.  ""Here  we  can  only  do  it  on  the  drill  squares  we  have  got  and  not  on  the  main  roads  or  thoroughfares  of  the  base,""  he  said.  ""We  get  around  that  problem  by  con  ducting  intensive  drill  every  chance  we  get.  So  we  have  adapted.""  While  the  facilities  at  Edinburgh  were  nearing  their  use-by  date,  the  staff  and  recruits  were  excited  at  being  handed  a  new  facility.  WGCDR  Ashworth  said  it  was  one  of  the  great  benefits  of  the  move.  ""The  move  has  resulted  in  a  multi-  million  dollar  refit  of  the  Airmen's  Mess  for  the  benefit  of  all,""  he  said.  ""Also  a  much-needed  running  track,  new  seating  and  covers  on  the  parade  ground  and  the  base  infra  structure  received  a  significant  boost  due  to  the  RAAFCOL  relocation  project.""  CPL  Baker  said  the  recruits  had  a  better  attitude  towards  their  accom-   modation  than  at  Edinburgh  because  it  was  clean  and  new  and  they  liked  to  keep  it  that  way.  Former  recruit  ACW  Tanya  Cahill  said:  ""Everyone  was  happy  and  we  didn't  expect  the  standard  to  be  as  high  as  it  was.""  One  significant  development  that  has  taken  place  is  the  purchase  of  a  large  amount  of  land  bordering  the  airfield  and  adjacent  farmland,  which  has  been  turned  into  a  dedicated  field  training  area.  The  area  has  been  transformed  into  the  most  modem  ground  defence  train  ing  area  Air  Force  has  ever  had.  WGCDR  Ashworth  said  it  had   taken  a  great  deal  of  work  by  force  pro  tection  staff  and  quite  a  few  recruits.  ""The  airfield  defence  guards  are  happy  with  what  they  now  have,""  he  said.  ""It  is  geared  up  to  the  kind  of  training  we  need  to  give  our  airmen  so  they  can  operate  credibly  when  they  are  deployed  on  operations.""  When  asked  about  the  future  for  1RTU,  WGCDR  Ashworth  said  life  there  was  like  painting  a  long  bridge  with  a  small  brush  -  by  the  time  you  have  got  to  one  end  you  have  to  start  again  at  the  other  and  come  back  again.   ""Continual  improvement  is  a  com  mon  feature  of  daily  life,""  he  said.  With  1RTU  back  home  at  a  base  that  is  dedicated  to  training,  unlike  Edinburgh,  it  will  now  be  easier  for  people  who  have  the  training  bug  to  come  and  try  life  at  1RTU.  ""Wagga  is  good  and  it  has  excel  lent  facilities  for  us,""  CPL  Baker  said.  ""And  even  though  there  may  be  a  few  others  who  still  prefer  Edinburgh,  I  think  over  time  people  will  judge  the  move  to  be  a  good  one.""  WGCDR  Ross  Jones  took  over  as  CO  of  1  RTU  this  year.

"  This  is  not  the  way  of  Alan  Zeino   What  occurred  on  the  night  that  does  deserve  comment  was  that  Alan  gave  a  big  'fuck  you'  to  the  whole  event,  its  organisers,  and  the  world  view  which  they  represent:  namely,  religious  belief.  Atheists  are  often  torn  as  to  how  to  respond  to  religious  belief  of  the  sort  that  takes  advantage  of  the  tolerance  of  the  state  (tax  breaks,  control  of  schools)  while  seeking  to  stifle  the  ability  of  others  to  do  the  same  (gay  marriage,  abortion  rights).  Some  respond  by  writing  books,  giving  interviews  and  generally  engaging  in  rational  debate.  This  is  not  the  way  of  Alan  Zeino.  At  the  very  beginning  of  the  event,  as  people  found  their  seats  and  waited  for  stuff  to  happen,  a  notice  was  put  on  the  overhead  screen  saying  ""We  request  our  respected  guests  to  please  observe  the  seating  arrangements  as  organised  by  the  organisers.  We  request  that  women  sit  in  the  back  half  of  the  room  and  men  in  the  front  half.""  This  is  the  kind  of  thing  that  puts  the  lie  to  secular  democratic  theory.  I  suppose  we  are  meant  to  respect  the  right  of  religious  people  not  to  respect  us.  This  malarkey  is  bad  enough  in  mosques,  but  we  were  in  a  university  campus  lecture  theatre  for  goodness'  sake.  On  this  note,  the  host  formally  opened  proceedings.  Uthman  Badar,  member  of  Hizb  ut  Tahrir  and  UWS  PhD  student  researching  Islamic  Economics,  had  the  privilege  of  speaking  for  the  first  twenty-five  minutes.  Uthman  is  a  practised  hand  at  these  debates.  There  is  youtube  footage  of  him  giving  the  same  sermon  in  2008.  He  has  a  vernacular  charm  and  understated  charisma  (think  John  Saffran)  that  invites  you  to  consider  his  opinions  with  an  open  mind.  And  so  I  did,  for  the  first  minute  or  so.  But  Uthman  ended  up  saying  or  carefully  implying  all  the  usual  things.  That  our  lives  need  a  sense  of  purpose  which  only  god  can  provide.  That  we  need  something  to  tell  us  ""how  to  act  correctly  in  life  and  be  successful"".  That  people  who  do  not  believe  in  ""God  before  life  and  accountability  after""  are  either  hedonists  or  have  no  purpose,  and  base  their  actions  on  ""whatever""  they  like.  Which  is  why  religious  regimes  have  been  so  much  nicer  to  live  in  than  secular  ones,  I  suppose.  On  one  level  there  is  no  problem  with  ""faith"";  it's  when  you  try  to  dress  it  up  as  something  people  just  have  to  inevitably  believe  that  you  enter  dangerous  territory.  Uthman,  just  like  evangelists  before  him  on  the  Christian  side,  had  the  hide  to  say  that  Islam  is  not  a  ""faith-based""  or  ""fidestic""  religion.  It  is  not  based  on  leaps  of  faith,  but  grounded  in  the  ""rational  method"".  The  same  old  snake  oil.  Predictably,  it  all  came  down  to  the  old  'first  origins'  argument.  Everything  has  a  cause,  therefore  the  beginning  of  the  universe  must  have   a  cause.  Ergo,  God  exists.  No  explanation  of  what  caused  God.  Turtles  all  the  way  down.  But  you  can  go  elsewhere  for  comprehensive  rebuttals  of  all  this.  I  think  there  are  two  kinds  of  faith.  One  is  a  private  resource  some  people  draw  on  for  emotional  consolation  and  confidence.  They  may  not  defend  the  logic  of  their  faith,  they  may  admit  that  it's  a  bit  illogical,  but  they  keep  it  as  a  psychological  cushion  for  use  in  hard  times.  That  kind  is  mostly  harmless  to  other  people.  The  other  kind  of  faith  is  a  world  view  that  rivets  the  believer's  identity  to  an  entire  rigid  ideology.  These  are  the  types  who  speak  out  and  influence  public  policy,  or  provide  a  constituency  and  therefore  power  to  those  who  do.  Judge  for  yourself  whether  the  results  have  hurt  social  progress:  our  failure  to  extend  marriage  rights  to  all  consenting  adults  regardless  of  sexuality;  some  significant  resistance  against  the  recent  change  in  our  overseas  aid  contributions  to  reproductive  health  clinics  that  offer  abortion;  Brendan  Nelson's  attempts  in  2006  to  insert  'intelligent  design'  into  the  science  curriculum  at  high  schools;  Catholic  schools  sacking  single  mothers.  These  are,  or  lead  to,  demonstrable  harms.  Why  is  belief  in  God  responsible  for  them?  Because  it  simplifies  ethics  into  a  system  of  ""objective  morality""  (believers  use  this  term  often  and  proudly).  Cost/benefit  analysis  should  be  the  measure  of  every  policy  debate,  not  adherence  to  strict  and  inflexible  rules  of  conduct  taken  from  religious  texts  or  customs.  Learning  to  constantly  detach  ourselves  from  our  opinions  is  the  cornerstone  of  a  liberal  education;  it  is  more  important  to  be  right  than  to  have  been  right.  Belief  in  God  implies  absolute,  objective  morals  and  seizes  up  the  minds  of  enough  people  to  cause  the  rest  of  us  problems.  There  was  something  awesome  about  what  Alan  did  to  these  people  and  their  event.  At  first  I  thought  he'd  given  up  this  excellent  opportunity  to  change  a  few  wavering  minds.  Now,  though,  I  think  of  Alan's  twenty  minute  comedy  routine  as  a  work  of  art.  I  watched  the  organisers,  listening  to  Alan,  waiting  for  him  to  address  the  topic  of  the  debate,  looking  at  each  other  with  expressions  that  said  ""he's  making  fun  of  this  whole  thing,  we've  seen  this  before"".  And  if  I  hadn't  actually  been  in  the  audience  and  been  infected  by  the  anger  and  hostility  I  would  have  found  it  immediately  hilarious.  Uthman,  his  time  running  out  but  with  so  much  more  to  tell  us,  wondered  aloud  how  he  could  fit  it  all  into  his  last  few  minutes.  Alan:  ""I'll  be  like,  five  minutes.  You  can  take  my  time.""  The  organisers  gazed  at  Alan,  confused.  This  frisson  of  anarchy  was  the  prelude  to  the  pure  theatre  that  followed.   Alan's  first  words  once  he'd  finished  playing  around  with  the  mic  and  fixed  his  coat  into  a  suitably  lank  hang,  were  these:  ""I  just  want  to  say,  to  all  my  Muslim  brothers  and  sisters  out  there,  thank  you.  Thank  you  for  replacing  South  Americans  as  the  villains  in  Hollywood  movies.  I  am  South  American  and  we've  been  misrepresented  for  too  long.""  The  crowd  shifted  restlessly,  murmuring  disapproval.  He  went  on.  ""This  topic  is  pointless,  and  I'll  tell  you  why.  Nobody  is  going  to  change  their  minds  tonight.""  Finally,  one  old  dude  had  had  enough.  He  raised  his  hand  and  complained  tremulously,  ""Excuse  me,  excuse  me  -  we  came  here  to  discuss  the  topic,  not  to  have  funny  times.  Does  God  exist,  does  he  not  exist?""  This  followed  by  some  mumbling  and  more  hand  waving.  Alan:  ""I'll  get  to  that,  but  let  me  finish  what  I  want  to  say  about  Sheikh  Al  Hilaly.""  This  was  the  realisation  Alan  wanted  to  offer  that  would  solve  people's  addiction  to  faith:  ""We  are  not  important,  human  beings  are  nothing  in  the  universe.  What's  a  Z-grade  celebrity  you  know?  We're  that!""  Religion  is  just  a  symptom  of  human  specieism  and  we  should  all  get  over  ourselves,  he  argued.  I  wanted  to  criticise  Alan  for  being  soft  on  religion,  but  then  I  remembered  the  logic  of  what  he  said  under  his  breath.  He  told  the  crowd  that  he  wasn't  like  those  'idiots'  who  think  that  religion  poisons  everything;  he  was  able  to  see  the  value  of  religious  opinion  in  a  secular  democracy,  and  he  liked  having  religious  voices  as  part  of  the  discourse  because,  to  paraphrase,  ""it's  funny"".  Insert  image  of  punching  bag.  Religion  motivates  a  lot  of  bad  things  without  doing  much  if  any  good.  This  is  worth  getting  angry  about  and,  I  suppose,  there  may  also  be  a  responsibility  to  help  change  people's  minds.  On  one  level,  outright  mockery  of  religious  belief  for  one's  own  amusement  isn't  really  living  up  to  that  aim.  But  because  it  is  funny,  and  because  I  just  think  they  deserved  it,  the  Alan  way  is  perfectly  legitimate.  Sure  it  was  nonsensical.  Belief  in  God  is  nonsensical.  Sometimes  you  just  have  to  fight  fire  with  fire.  I  left  the  debate  just  as  Uthman  got  up  to  speak  for  another  thirty  minutes,  Alan's  remaining  time  having  been  hastily  cancelled.  As  I  pondered  Alan's  fearless  nihilism,  I  was  reminded  of  the  protagonist  from  Albert  Camus'  The  Outsider.  Like  Meursault,  Alan  Zeino  is  ""the  only  Christ  that  we  deserve."" ",2009-11-06

"  ?   No  more  lollies  -  we  have  had  enough  of  handouts   1  feel  that  the  Torres  Strait  want  to  take  a  new  direction  into  a  new  future  for  our  people.  We  ha\e  had  enough  of  handouts  and  decisions  without;  consultation.  We  know  that  from  the  earlv  da\s  God  promised  the  land  to  the  children  of  Israel.  In  the  same  we  Christians  know  that  God  gave  the  land  of  the  Torres  to  the  Torres  Strait  to  the  Torres  Strait  people.  God  gave  us  the  same  command  ""to  increase  and  multiply   and  to  care  for  our  wonderful  islands"".  Rut  what  do  we  find?  Most  of  our  people  are  in  Hvile  throughout  Australia  where  the\  cannot  practice  their  customs  or  work  at  their  skills  of  fishing  and  car\  mg  and  painting.  Like  the  Children  of  Israel  they  need  to  he  released  to  return  to  this  Promise  Land.  Why?  one  reason  because  mainland  Australia  is  using  our  islands  as  health  and  quarantine  barrier  to  protect  the  rest  of  the   countrN  so  the  less  people  there  are  up  here  the  better  this  wmk  for  mainland  Australia.  Our  islands  and  waters  fed  large  groups  of  people  in  the  past.  The\  could  do  so  again,  especialh  if  w  e  gamed  real  control  ON  or  our  fishing  grounds.  We  must  work  if  we  want  Torres  Strait  to  be  a  separate  Territory  of  Australia.  We  must  stand  on  our  own  feet  and  tell  the  central  government  that  the  people  of  the  Torres  Strait  can  govern  oursehes.  as  we  were   doing  before  the  Queensland  go\eminent  took  awa\  what  little  so\  ereignt&gt;  w  e  had  w  hen  they  dissolved  the  Island  Councils,  because  the\  need  to  balance  the  budget.  The  Church  already  has  a  Torres  Strait  Regional  Bishop,  which  is  the  step  in  the  right  direction.  This  shows  us  the  way  ahead  for  the  Torres  Strait.  We  Christians  need  to  show  the  way  for  the  central  government  by  our  united  witness  to  our  need   to  become  a  new  creation  m  these  wonderful  islands  that  the  Lord  has  created  for  us.  We  are  proud  people,  we  arc  proud  that  we  are  Lastern  Islands  or  Western  Islanders  and  that  is  a  good  thing.  But  we  need  to  follow  a  new  way  now.  We  to  be  \ery  proud  of  being  a  Torres  Strait  Islander.  We  hase  a  proud  history  in  these  Islands  of  ours.  We  need  to  stand  up.   Thursday  Island.

"  Historic  baptism  for  Toowoomba  sailors   .  FIVE  members  of  HM  AS  Toowoomba's  ship's  company  recently  stood  fearless  in  front  of  30  of  their  colleagues  .  as  they  stepped  into  the  River  Jordan  to  be   baptised  as  Christians  by  CHAP  Steve  Gunther.  -  .  The  river  is  one  of  the  most  histori-;  cally  and  spiritually  significant  places  in  ,  the  world  -  the  site  of  Jesus'  baptism  by  John  the  Baptist.  .  .  -  .  -  '  ,  When  LSMED  Jarrod  Vowell,;  LSET  Nathan  Arnall;  ABET  Emry  Thaggard-  Crocker,  ABBM  Craig  Everett  and-  ABMT  Laurence  Flynn  rose  out  of  the  .  river  there  was  a  definite  sense  for  all  of.  them  that  this  occasion  marked  the  begin  ning  of  a  new  life  and,  for  those  gathered  ,  to  watch,  that  they  had  witnessed  some-  ;  thing  both  spiritual  and  profound.  LSMED  Vowell  said  it  was  one  of  the  best  days  of  his  life.  ""To  have  the  opportunity  to  be  bap  tised  in  the  same  place  as  Jesus  was  awe-  inspiring.  I  am  so  grateful,""  he  said.  CHAP  Gunther  said  the.  experience  was  extremely  profound,  for  all  those  who  were  privileged  enough  to.be  present.  .  '.'To  be  a  part  of  five,  young  men  shamelessly  standing  up  to  be  counted  for  their  faith  in  front  of  their  shipmates  was  humbling  and  both  an  honour  and  ;  privilege  for  me  personally,""  he  said.  .  ""For  us  to  do  this  :  in  the  river  where   Jesus,  was  baptised,,  a  place  with  such""  .  .  historical  and  spiritual  significance,  .  was  truly  breathtaking  and  definitely  an  answer  to  a  prayer.""  The  baptism  site  on  the  Jordan  side  .  of  the  River  Jordan  is  one  of  the  most  important  recent  discoveries  .in  biblical  .  archaeology.  ,  '  &gt;'  Excavations  only  began  in  .1  996  fol  lowing  Jordan's  peace  treaty  with  Israel  .  in  1994,  but  it  has'  already,  uncovered  '  the  remains  of  five  churches  as  well  as  caves  and  baptismal  pools,  dating  from  .  the  Roman  and  Byzantine  periods.

"  WORLD  NEWS  OF  THE  WORLD   UTTER  BASTARD  STILL  RICH   In  spite  of  the  ongoing  financial  crisis,  an  utter  bastard  is  still  quite  rich.  We  met  him  in  his  plush  inner  city  apartment,  wearing  his  usual  self-satisfied  smile  that  tells  everyone  he  meets  how  much  better  than  them  he  is.  He  explained  in  great  detail  how  rich  he  still  is  and  how  little  the  market  collapse  has  affected  his  wealth.  Rather  than  showing  humility,  he  seemed  to  have  become  even  more  smug  and  insufferable  in  the  face  of  the  world's,  financial  difficulties.  Having  retained  most  of  his  wealth,  the  fact  that  he  had  sufficient  resources  and  market  know  how  to  weather  such  a  storm  made  him  feel  smugger  than  ever  about  his  own  superiority.  ""Thank  God  I  was  smart  enough  to  invest  wisely!""  he  said,  in  a  way  that  made  people  want  to  break  his  nose.  •   Racist  unsure  who  to  support  in  ongoing  Arab-Israeli  conflict.  Mark  Damian,  racist  and  bigot,  has  always  shown  a  keen  interest  in  international  affairs.  However,  the  latest  outbreak  of  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  has  left  him  lost  for  words  as  both  sides  represent  things  he  hates  and  opposes.  ""On  the  one  hand,  you  have  a  horde  of  Muslims  launching  bombs  because  they  believe  in  a  false  prophet.  They  are  evil  and  a  threat  to  all  good  white  Christians  everywhere.""  On  the  other  hand,  the  Jewish  state  is  also  anathema  to  Mark.  ""There's  already  a  cabal  of  Jews  controlling  the  banking  industry.  But  now  they've  got  a  home  base  from  which  to  destroy  us  through  interbreeding,  multiculturalism  and  manipulation  of  the  international  economy.  These  people  are  evil  and  a  threat  to  all  good  white  Christians  everywhere.""  This  dilemma  has  Mark  stumped.  ""It's  very  difficult,""  he  sighed.  ""Maybe  they'll  descend  into  a  mutually  destructive  cycle  of  violence,  retaliation  and  death  -  that  seems  to  be  working  pretty  well  so  far.""

WORLD  NEWS  OF  THE  WORLD   GAY  MAN:  QUITE  WELL  ADJUSTED    On  Thomas  Alderson's  twentieth  birthday,  the  North  Sydney  student  came  to  terms  with  something  he  had  known  in  his  heart  for  all  his  life.    He  was  gay.    Upon  acknowledging  this  life-changing  truth  about  his  identity,  Thomas  decided  to  go  down  the  road  to  the  24  hour  McDonalds  for  a  late  dinner.  As  the  student  of  Commerce  and  Law  explained:  ""Normally  I  get  a  Happy  Meal  but  it  seemed  kind  of  like  a  special  day  so  I  got  a  fillet'o'fish  instead.""  When  Thomas  shared  the  news  with  his  family  the  reaction  was  neither  positive  nor  negative.    When  contacted  by  Tharunka  his  mother,  Helene  Alderson,  said:  ""  He's  a  pretty  good  boy.    It  doesn't  really  matter  to  us  whether  he's  gay  or  straight,  just  as  long  as  he  finishes  his  degree.""  His  father,  Steven,  concurred:  ""Tom's  sexuality  is  quite...hmm,  yes.    Has  anyone  taken  int  he  washing?""  After  a  short  poriod  of  confusion  and  personal  agitation,  Thomas  found  that  his  life  looked  very  much  the  same  as  it  had  been  before.    He  continued  to  work,  study  and  relax  with  friends,  often  frequenting  the  local  establishment  and  sometimes  visiting  a  more  upmarket  bar  int  he  city  when  he  had  the  cash.  A  few  colleagues  at  his  part  time  job  in  a  Mosman  cafe'  may  have  displayed  some  latent  homophobia.    However  it  was  hard  to  tell  as  they  had  never  really  been  friends  anyway.  As  Thomas  observes:  ""  They  just  kind  of  grunted  when  I  told  them.    We  didn't  really  hang  out  before,  and  we  didn't  really  hang  out  afterwards  either.    So  I  don't  really  know  if  there  was  a  difference  or  not.""  Towards  the  end  of  our  interview  Thomas  became  visibly  impatient,  fidgeting  and  casting  frequent  glances  in  the  direction  of  his  watch.  He  attributed  this  state  if  mind  to  the  fact  that  he  had  promised  to  go  to  the  beach  with  his  housemate,  Andrew,  who  joined  us  towards  the  end  of  our  discussion.  When  asked  whether  his  relationship  with  Thomas  had  been  altered,  Andrew  gave  the  matter  some  consideration  before  replying  ""Um,  not  really.  Hey  do  you  know  if  we're  gonna  be  in  time  for  the  bus?""  Said  Thomas:  ""Let's  get  lunch  first.""    Youse  imigrants  need  to  speak  english!!!!    It  makes  me  real  mad  when  I  here  people  talking  foreign  languages  on  the  bus  and  in  in  the  streets  ur  in  Australia  speak  english  so  we  can  all  understand  you.    I'm  not  racist  or  nothin  but,  id  say  its  very  easy  to  learn  to  to  speak  english  I  mean  I  learned  it  as  a  baby,  so  imigrants  should  learn  it  so  they  don't  have  to  use  they're  wog  languages  in  Australia.    BIG  PACKAGE  STIMULATES  eager  Australian  economy    After  a  long  period  of  teasing  and  building  tension,  the  Australian  parliament  finally  gave  it  up  yesterday,  much  to  the  relief  and  excitement  of  an  Australian  public  begging  for  deep  and  long-lasting  stimulus.  The  much  need  stimulation  comes  after  a  period  of  sluggish  and  limp  activity,  during  which  the  economy  found  itself  too  busy,  stressed  or  sick  to  be  fully  excited.    This  package  is  expected  to  be  big  and  impressive  enough  that  Australia  will  become  aroused  to  new  heights  of  economic  activity.    Business  heads  are  swollen  with  excitement  at  th  prospect  of  getting  the  package  into  their  hands,  anticipating  that  it  will  supply  sufficient  fluidity  to  lubricate  the  wheels  of  industry.  Indeed,  experts  are  hoping    that  the  package  will  have  enough  strength  to  deliver  the  goods  and  reach  deep  enough  to  satisfy  everyone's  needs.    The  package  will  focus  particularly  on  targeting  vulnerable  areas,  activating  these  sensitive  spots  and  using  multiplier  effect  to  increase  the  amount  of  stimulation  reaching  through  parts  of  the  nation.  However,  given  the  demanding  task  at  hand,  advisors  have  warned  parliament  against  shooting  it's  load  prematurely.    They  say  that  it  will  need  to  be  flexible  in  its  approach  if  it  hopes  for  the  package  to  penetrate  everywhere  it  is  needed,  and  that  stamina  will  be  important  if  this  stimulus  is  going  to  get  the  economy  up  and  keep  it  up  for  as  long  as  necessary. &lt;p&gt; ",2009-03-06
"  Why,  When  and  Wisway   Why  is  it  that  certain  Torres  Strait  Islanders  cannot  be  satisfied  when  another  Torres  Strait  Islander  is  always  Going  to  be  more-qualified  and  skilled  to  perform  management  positions  than  they  can?  Why  is  it  that  when  qualified  Torres  Strait  Islanders  are  successful  in  obtaining  high  credentials  and  are  employed  in  their  homeland  Torres  Strait,  that  it  takes  another  Torres  Strait  Islander  to  challenge  their  qualification.  when  after  all  Torres  Strait  Islanders  are  meant  to  be  united  and  working  along  side  one  another  to  strive  for  the  betterment  for  people  of  Torres  Strait?  Why  is  it  that  one  needs  to  transfer,  move,  relocate  to  overemployment  positions  when  it  is  truly  clear  that  they  are  the  right  Torres  Strait  Island  man  or  woman  destined  to  implement  effective  results  in  their  field  of  expertise?  Why  is  it  that  certain  Torres  Strait  Islanders  misjudge,  misinterpret,  carry  yarn  about  a  fellow  Torres  Strait  Islander  descendant?  Is  it  pure  jealousy?  My  brother,  Phillip  Mills,  dedicated  his  life  and  health  to  improve  the  Health  Status  and  System  of  the  Torres  Strait,  as  did  my  niece  Jacinta  Morseu,  only  to  be  betrayed  by  their  own  people.  Some  things  are  better  left  unsaid,   because  all  Torres  Strait  Islanders  are  meant  to  he  good  Christians,  and  practise  Good  Pasin,  anyway  only  the  Lord  God  will  judge  and  punish  the  betrayers.  Torres  Strait  families,  community  and  peoples  are  all  crying  out  for  Indigenous  Torres  Strait  Island  Men  and  Woman  blo  place  to  hold  all  positions  in  the  Torres  Strait,  as  this  is  the  time  to  move  forward,  but  as  we  all  know  another  European  with  all  the  incentive  packages  (house,  land,  relocation,  higher  salaries,  and  some  cultural  knowledge)  will  once  again  fill  these  positions.  Why?  Because  the  Torres  Strait  Islander  race  face  racism  from  their  own  people.  Torres  Strait  Islanders  some  of  whom  are  black,  brown  or  fair-skin  colour,  regardless  of  the  outer  skin,  it  is  the  blood  line  that  makes  us  a  true  Torres  Strait  Islander  Nation.  For  your  information:  Jacinta  Morseu's  Bloodline:  Wallis  family,  her  Athe  Cordon  Pablo  Aboriginal  and  Rotuma,  related  to  Sebasio,  Mills  families  from  Samoa,  Vanuatu,  Poid  (Kubin).  Aka  Wah  Wah  Mer,  Aka  Wasada  Passi  married  Athe  Santiago  Dorante  (Phillipino).  Aka  Wana  from   lama.  So  for  all  the  voices  from  Government  agencies  (you  know  who  you  are)  slop  discussing  issues  of  mismanagement,  as  you  and  I  are  well  aware:  Mismanagement  is  the  norm,  although  on  ground  level  the  community  members,  families,  elders,  athes  and  akas.  and  all  our  children  are  suffering,  please  just  you  perform  your  position  effectively  and  slop  being  opinionated  without  proof,  or  it  will  land  you  in  court.  Sometimes  I  wonder  why  kill  yourself  to  struggle  for  Torres  Strait  (my  and  your  Island  Home)  when  truly  (me  and  you)  know  there  is  always  going  to  he  ungrateful  and  unappreciated  little  people  who  want  to  wear  big  hats  and  yet  still  cannot  perform.  Once  again,  wake  up  my  people,  look  carefully  around  you.  we're  meant  to  move  forward  together  as  one  people  not  stab  one  another  in  the  back.  As  I  stated  in  last  paper,  I,  Elder  of  this  community  and  a  very  tired  one  at  that,  and  I  wonder  Why,  When  and  Wisway,  are  we  ever  going  to  unite  and  work  and  walk  toward  together,  tor  young  and  old  blo  place. &lt;p&gt;   Mrs  Sana  Florence  Dorante,  Thursday  Island.

"  Ngurpai  Ikama  Ikya  Council  NPA  Education  and  Training  Council  News  The  Northern  Peninsula  Area  Ngurpai  Ikama  Ikya  Council  (NPANIIC)  was  mandated  by  a  community  process  agreement  to  represent  the  NPA  region  on  providing  strategic  direction  and  policy  advice  to  government  agencies,  providers  and  industry  across  the  broad  spectrum  of  Education,  Vocational  Education  &amp;  Training  in  the  Northern  Peninsula  Area  (NPA).  The  Council  consist  of  five  elders  from  each  of  the  NPA  communities,  Traditional  Owners,  youths  and  community  members.  The  academic  achievement  by  our  children  is  a  major  concern  for  our  communities.  As  a  consequence  we  should  be  recognised  as  a  separate  body  to  TSIRFX'.  Senator  Furrier  with  Oiunni  Chairman  Jeffrie  Aniba,  Council  member  Rev.  May  Eseli  and  the  Injinoo  prep  class  The  council  hosted  a  visit  to  NPAC  on  Friday  28  August  by  Queensland  Senator  Mark  Furner  and  Regional  Executive  Director  Clive  Dixon  from  Education  Queensland.  The  visitors  toured  all  three  campuses  and  met  with  teachers  and  students  while  viewing  the  college  facilities.  This  was  an  excellent  opportunity  for  the  college  administration  to  show  the  new  campus  facilities  and  upgrades  while  also  showing  the  Senator  the  areas  where  improvement  and  upgrades  are  needed.  The  council  will  work  with  the  college  and  other  bodies  in  the  community  to  develop  better  outcomes  for  the  region's  children.  From  the  Bamaga  P-6  Campus  District  Wide  Assessment  Task  This  term  our  students  arc  working  on  their  District  Wide  Assessment  Tasks  (DWAT).  Along  with  focused  Literacy  &amp;  Numeracy  lessons  the  students  are  producing  quality  assessment  pieces  that  reflect  what  they  have  been  learning.  The  range  of  assessment  includes  Boat  design  &amp;  construction,  boating  safety  pamphlets,  mask  design  and  creation,  healthy  foods  cookbook  launch  &amp;  presentation,  bullying  multimedia  presentation.  Families  as  First  Teachers  (FAFT)  Our  Early  Years  teachers,  Margo  Bond  and  Vera  Christian  travelled  to  Kuranda  District  State  College  (KDSC)  to  gather  information  about  the  College's  award  winning  program  Families  as  First  Teachers  (FAFT).  The  FAFT  program  entails  two  teachers  visiting  communities  and  hosting  educational  playgroups  for  pre-school  children  and  their  families.  Important  early  literacy  and  numeracy  skills  are  shared  with  families  at  these  playgroups  to  prepare  the  children  for  compulsory  schooling.  This  term  the  Bamaga  P-6  Campus  has  trialled  a  program  where  two  staff  members  host  a  playgroup  in  our  new  Pre-Prep  Centre.  Next  term  the  program  will  be  expanded  to  all  the  communities  that  Bamaga  P-6  Campus  services.

Date  Claimers:  Classroom  News  :  Senior  Art  Hello  to  everyone  Poor  student  attendance  is  one  of  the  biggest  factors  preventing  students  from  obtaining  a  good  education  at  NPA  State  C  ollege.  In  2008.  NPA  State  Col  lege  had  the  second  worst  attendance  rate  of  any  of  the  117  schools  in  the  FNQ  Region.  In  2008.  on  average,  a  student  attended  only  62°  o  of  the  time.  This  means  that  in  a  typical  school  year  consisting  of  10  months  of  lesson  time,  a  student  is  missing  4  months.  At  this  attendance  rate  in  the  fourteen  years  of  schooling  that  a  young  person  would  do  from  Pre-prep  to  War  12,  the  student  would  only  complete  the  equivalent  of  eight  and  one  half  years  of  school.  bach  student  would  :nis&gt;  five  and  one  half  years  of  schooling!  1  hose  figures  tell  the  story,  l.'nlcss  the  NPA  children  come  to  school  more  regularly,  when  they  graduate  from  scar  12.  they  will  always  be  poorly  educated  in  comparison  to  children  who  attend  more  frequently.  In  the  competition  for  jobs  with  students  from  other  schools  where  students  attend  all  the  time,  they  will  alwavs  miss  out  hecausc  of  their  comparativ  ely  poor  literacv  and  numeracy  skills.  Over  the  next  couple  of  months.  College  staff  are  beginning  a  consultation  process  with  the  NPA  communities  to  determine  the  causes  of  poor  student  attendance  and  to  identify  what  can  be  done  to  fix  the  problem.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  as  many  parents  as  possible  in  this  consultation  process.  Attendance  is  you-me  business  with  everyone  in  the  community  needing  to  be  involved.

"  From  the  Principal's  Desk...  A  big  hello  to  everyone.  Last  week,  I  attended  an  education  conference  in  Cairns  along  with  over  300  leaders  from  the  175  schools  in  the  FNQ  Region.  The  theme  of  the  conference  was  the  Service  Commitment,  the  notion  that  every  year  12  student  who  graduates  from  an  FNQ  Region  school  will  either  go  to  university,  or  obtain  an  apprenticeship  or  trainceship.  or  move  into  fulltime  employment.  I  was  very  pleased  to  see  that  the  work  that  is  currently  happening  at  NPA  Stale  College  to  ensure  that  our  current  cohort  of  Year  12  students  meets  the  Service  Commitment  target  is  as  good  and  in  most  cases  better  than  what  is  happening  in  other  schools.  All  of  our  Year  12  students  have  identified  the  careers  that  they  wish  to  pursue  on  graduation.  An  industry  placement  program  is  currently  being  organised  so  that  each  of  these  students  can  receive  some  on-the-job  training  and  work  experience  in  their  career  area.  Discussions  arc  happening  to  finalise  the  training  programs  with  Tropical  North  Queensland  Institute  of  TAFF.  staff  so  that  each  student  will  get  the  nationally  recognised  qualifications  they  need  for  their  job.  I  would  really  like  to  thank  the  employers  in  the  NPA  for  their  generosity  in  accepting  the  College  students  for  workplacement  as  well  as  to  acknowledge  the  great  work  that  Mr  Jeffrey  Aniba  is  doing  to  support  the  College  to  develop  greater  partnerships  with  the  community  to  deliver  on  the  Service  Commitment  At  the  end  of  this  year,  I  look  forward  to  reporting  on  how  well  our  Year  12  students  have  gone  with  the  Service  Commitment.  The  motto  at  NPA  State  College  this  year  is  'Whatever  it  takes'  as  we  owe  our  young  people  the  very  best  future  that  we  can  possibly  give  them.  Regards.  Ken  Maclean  College  Principal  First  P&amp;C  meeting  held  for  2009  Wednesday  night  at  the  High  School  library  more  than  thirty  parents  and  teachers  attended  the  first  meeting  of  the  year.  Reports  were  given  about  each  campus  and  this  was  followed  by  open  discussion  on  ways  of  improving  the  college.  Topics  included  security  of  the  school  sites,  seating  on  parades,  building  upgrades  and  school  attendance.  All  parents  are  invited  to  attend  future  meetings.

Our  ""Meet  and  Greet**  Night  was  a  grcal  success  with  over  180  parents,  students,  and  teachers  attending.  It  was  great  for  new  and  established  teachers  to  meet  with  parents  in  the  community.  It  also  provided  the  opportunity  for  parents  to  visit  their  children's  classrooms  to  see  all  the  wonderful  learning  which  has  taken  place  so  far  this  year.  Our  School  Captains  and  Sport  House  Captains  were  also  announced  at  the  parent  night:  School  Captains  -  Jerry  Ahmat  and  Mena-Jade  Newman.

The  evening  was  completed  by  a  sausage  sizzle.  There  are  some  major  changes  occurring  throughout  the  year  at  the  Bamaga  P-6  Campus.  At  present  the  exterior  of  the  school  is  being  painted.  It  has  made  a  huge  difference  to  the  appearance  of  the  school.  The  internal  painting  will  commence  later  in  the  year.  We  are  also  waiting  on  the  construction  of  our  new  pre  prep  building  with  playground.  This  will  commence  after  the  wet  season.  We  are  also  looking  forward  to  our  new  administration  block  and  library  building.  The  construction  of  these  building  should  take  place  early  2010.  The  community,  students  and  staff  are  very  excited  about  all  the  new  additions  to  our  campus!!!!

In  Literacy  we  hav  e  been  focusing  on  (he  narrative  genre  and  through  our  writing  we  lu\  e  been  developing  our  know  ledge  of  sight  vwMxk  letters  and  sounds.  We  have  created  our  very  own  class  version  of  Womb!  Stew  wihida  has  helped  us  increase  our  know  ledge  of  sentence  structure  and  writing  for  an  audience.  In  Numeracy  we  have  been  looking  al  numbers  to  100,  addition  and  measurement.  We  have  been  exploring  our  environment  and  identifying  the  2D  shapes  around  us.  We  have  been  graphing  different  pieces  of  information  and  using  our  knowledge  of  patterns  to  solve  problems.  We  are  all  very  happy  to  be  back  at  NPAC  after  the  holidays  and  are  eager  to  learn  as  much  as  we  can  in  Year  2.
