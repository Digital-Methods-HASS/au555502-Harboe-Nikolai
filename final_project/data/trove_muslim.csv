"  Muslim,  Jewish  women  share  issues   THE  similarities  between  Judaism  and  Islam  surprised  many  of  the  young  Muslim  women  who  attended  an  interfaith  dialogue  addressed  by  the  vice-president  of  Or  Chadash  Synagogue  Judy  Levitan.   The  Lakemba  meeting,  organised  by  the  Muslim  Women  Association  (MWA),  also  fea  tured  a  Roman  Catholic  speaker,  Lisa   McDonald.   MWA  president  Maha  Abdo  hailed  the  dis  cussion  of  the  tenets  of  the  three  monotheistic  faiths:  “We  called  the  meeting  The  Power  of  Our  Faith  because  I  think  each  of  us  finds  power  in  our  faiths.  We  all  believe  in  one  God  and  we  all  have  very  similar  issues  dating  back  to  Adam  and  Eve  and  Ibrahim,  peace  be  upon  him.  We  will  all  be  judged  by  the  same  God,  so  we  feel  there’s  a  reason  He  created  us  different  ly   “This  was  the  first  meeting  of  its  kind  and  it’s  going  to  be  the  first  of  many.  I  think  it  will  put  a  lot  of  tranquility  in  people’s  hearts,  allowing  us  to  be  secure  in  our  beliefs  without  ridiculing  others’  faiths,  accepting  differences  and  build  ing  on  the  similarities.”   She  said  that  many  of  the  50  Year  10-12  Muslim  girls  in  the  audience  were  surprised  at  how  much  Judaism  and  Islam  had  in  common.   Ms  Lacey  said  Ms  Levitan  spoke  about  the  tenets  of  Judaism  and  how  young  people  par  ticipated  in  the  Jewish  community,  and  explained  the  centrality  of  Israel  and  Jerusalem  in  Judaism.  “The  discussion  was  warm  and  friendly,  and  the  similarities  between  Islam  and  Judaism  were  noted.  It  was  a  very  lively  and  very  constructive  discussion.” ",2000-05-12
"  Call  to  end  support  for  Muslim  refugees  rejected   AT  THE  BOARD   STEFAN   BIALOGUSKfl   A  SOLITARY  call  to  end  the  commu  nity’s  support  for  Muslim  refugees  was  firmly  rebuffed  at  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  monthly  plenum  last  week.   “Our  community  has  a  very  strong  sense  of  social  conscious  ness,  but  I,  as  an  individual,  am  appalled  that  this  body  has  sup  ported  helping  Muslim  refugees  from  the  Middle  East  as  part  of  our  feeling  that  we  should  help  other  refugees  because  we  were  once  refugees,”  Sophie  Caplan  told  fellow  deputies.  “I  suggest  we  not  be  such  good  people  and  not  support   Muslims.”   Ms  Caplan’s  statement  followed  a  report  by  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  national  vice-presi  dent  Jeremy  Jones,  in  which  he  described  antisemitic  outbursts  by  some  anti-Israel  lobbyists.  However,  Mr  Jones  led  a  string  of  rebuttals  of  Ms  Caplan’s  suggestion.   “The  end  of  winning  the  Middle  East  debate  doesn’t  justify  the  means  of  not  being  generous  in  our  hearts  and  in  our  policies  to  refugees,”  he  said.  “I  believe  the  final  product  will  be  determined  by  the  means,  and  if  the  means  are  not  ones  with  which  I  would  be  happy  to  live,  then  I  don’t  think  the  ends  would  be  particularly  good.”   Board  president  Stephen  Rothman  said  he  could  appreciate  the  anger  engendered  by  anti  Jewish  material  that  has  appeared  in  the  context  of  the  Middle  East  vio  lence,  but  he  reminded  the  plenum  of  the  benefits  that  the  Jewish  com  munity  had  derived  from  the  toler   Sophie  Caplan   ance  generated  by  Australia’s  multi  cultural  society.   He  also  warned  against  stereo  typing  Arabs  and  Muslims  in  this  country  as  all  being  anti-Israel  or  hostile  towards  Jews.  “Bear  in  mind  that  most  Muslims  in  Australia  are  not  Arabs  and  most  Arabs  in  Australia  are  not  Muslim,  so  you  must  be  very  careful  about  generalising.”   Educator  Dr  Harry  Oppermann  added:  “There’s  a  Talmudic  teach  ing  which  says  if  your  friend  asks  you  a  favour  at  the  same  time  as  your  enemy  —  and  I’m  not  sug  gesting  that  Muslims  are  automati   Premier  Bob  Carr  at  the  Board  of  Deputies.   cally  the  enemy  —  you  should  rush  to  assist  your  enemy  first.”   Earlier,  Mr  Jones  described  how  an  anti-Israel  rally  outside  the  US  Consulate  recently  featured  a  non  Arab  speaker  who  referred  to  the  “evil,  Talmudic,  Zionist  Jews”  —  comments  which  received  no  media  attention.   Furthermore,  a  letter  was  being  cir  culated  among  the  “human  rights  community”  by  Melbourne  resident  Asem  Judeh  in  which  he  wrote:  “Indeed,  the  Zionists  never  completes  (sic)  its  joy  and  blessing  in  Rosh  Hashanah  (Mew  Year  feast)  without  BLOOD,  Palestinian  BLOOD  (sic)”.   And  the  Australian  Muslim  News  recently  published  a  statement  by  the  Supreme  Islamic  Council  of  New  South  Wales  which  referred  to  the  “so-called  holocaust”.   Ms  Caplan  was  singled  out  at  the  start  of  the  meeting  by  Premier  Bob  Carr  in  his  address.  He  thanked  the  Jewish  community  for  its  “coopera  tion  in  the  greatest  event  that  NSW  has  been  called  on  to  stage,  the  Olympic  Games.  Your  community  was  out  in  front.  One  of  the  first  vol  unteers  I  met  was  Sophie  Caplan  in  the  Athletes  Village,  making  sure  we  were  projecting  an  image  of  friendli  ness  to  our  visitors.”   Sephardi  Chief  Rabbi  Eiiyahu  Bakshl-Doron,  who  will  be  the  main  speaker  at  the  rededication  of  the  Sephardi   Synagogue,  Wooilahra,  on  December  10,  the  Board  was  informed.  The  38-year-old  synagogue  has  undergone  a  10-month  renovation,  Including  the  Installation  of  a  women's  gallery.   In  addition  to  expressing  solidari  ty  with  the  State’s  Jews  in  the  face  of  physical  attacks  and  intimidation,  Mr  Carr  said  he  was  planning  to  visit  Israel  next  year  with  the  Australia  Israel  Chamber  of  Commerce.  The  “miracle  of  the  Israeli  economy”,  he  said,  “shows  the  Middle  East  what’s  on  offer  if  peace  can  be  secured.  It’s  demonstrated  that  high-tech  economies  can  flourish  in  the  region.  I  want  to  see  Australia  share  in  that  success,  so  I’m  preparing  to  visit  Israel  in  2001,  leading  an  AICC  mission  to  see  if  we  can  gain  a  boost,  particularly  in  the  high-tech  and  telecommunications  sectors.” ",2000-12-01

"  US  expert  sounds  terrorism  warning   Marie  BrisSdn   HEZBOLLAH  and  the  Muslim  Brotherhood  are  operating  in  Australia  and  may  target  the  Sydney  Olympics,  an  American  terrorism  expert  has   warned.   Director  of  the  American  Jewish  Committee’s  division  on  Middle  East  and  International  Terrorism,  Yehudit  Barsky  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  terrorist  organisations  including   the  Hezbollah  and  the  Muslim  Brotherhood  have  had  links  in   Australia  for  many  years.   Hezbollah  operatives  in  Australia  have  been  able  to  raise  money  and  move  freely,  she  said  —  and  the  Olympics  made  Australia  more  attrac   tive  to  terrorists.   “The  Games  represent  to  terrorist  organisations  the  apogee  of  Western  culture.  They  look  at  Western  culture  as  Western  imperialism.  From  their  perspective,  it  is  a  weapon  used  by  the  West  to  destroy  the  Muslim  world,  to  destroy  the  spiritual  integrity  of  the   Muslim  world.”   Terrorists  chose  targets  depending  upon  the  security  surrounding  them,  Ms  Barsky  said.  “If  the  Sydney  Games  were  nominated  as  a  target  for  a  ter  rorist  act,  but  proved  to  be  inaccessi  ble,  then  a  secondary  target  such  as  the  Jewish  community  was  likely  to  be  another  objective.   “There  are  members  of  Hezbollah  in  Australia.  This  has  been  stated  by  heads  of  intelligence  agencies  for  the  last  decade.  So  in  looking  at  this  issue,  the  capability  that  these  groups  have  and  the  fact  that  they  are  able  to  do  certain  things  because  we  are  not  going  to  draconian  measures  in  our  society,  means  they  are  going  to  con   tinue  to  exist  here.”   Ms  Barsky  said  terrorists  saw  their   existence  in  Australia  in  terms  of  an   investment.  They  were  able  to  travel  freely  throughout  Australia,  organise  lectures,  publish  magazines  and  repli  cate  video  and  audiotapes  for  their  organisation.   One  of  the  most  extreme  Muslim   publications  is  published  in  Australia,   —Nida’ulIslam.  “It  is  the  most  blatant   example  of  a  publication  of  Sunni  radi  cal  Muslim  groups  that  legitimise  sui  cide  bombings  —  they  call  them  mar  tyrdom  operations.  There  is  no  publi   cation  like  that  in  the  US  or  Britain.”   Ms  Barsky  was  a  guest  of  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council.  Criticising  stereotypes,  she  said:  “It  is  insulting  to  a  peaceful  per  son  who  observes  his  religion  as  a   Muslim  when  he  sees  the  abuse  these  movements  make  of  the  religion  as  a  political  movement  and  as  radical  political  ideology.”   9  Next  week  —  ASO  prepares   to  deal  with  terrorists ",2000-07-14
"  JOHANNESBURG:  A  Muslim  radio  star  tion  is  asking  a  court  to  amend  the  country’s  code  of  conduct  for  broad  casters  that  prohibits  hate  speech.   In  a  case  before  the  Johannesburg  High  Court,  Radio  786  said  the  code  limits  freedom  of  expression.   It  brought  the  case  after  the  South  African  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  lodged  a  complaint  against  it  for  airing  a  program  on  Zionism  and  Israel.   Appearing  on  the  program  was  Yacoub  Zaki  of  the  Muslim  Institute  in  London,  who  said:  “I  accept  that  one  million-plus  Jews  died  during  the  Second  World  War,  but  I  dispute  the  fact  that  they  were  murdered,  that  they  were  killed  by  gassing.  These  people  died,  like  other  people  in  the  camps,  from  infectious  diseases.”   The  code  of  conduct  states  that  broadcasters  shall  not  air  material  that  is  indecent  or  offensive  to  public  morals,  or  is  offensive  to  religious  con  victions  or  feelings.   The  Board  of  Deputies  contends  that  the  code  is  a  justifiable  limitation  on  freedom  of  expression.  Setting  it  aside  would  permit  hate  speech  to  be  broadcast  in  South  Africa,  it  contend  ed.  “We  maintain  that  Radio  786  has  attempted  to  disguise  classic  antise  mitic  racism  and  Holocaust  denial   under  the  guise  of  opposition  to  the  political  ideology  of  Zionism,”  it  said.   The  station  charged  that  the  code  was  “put  in  place  during  apartheid  days  and  is  too  broad.  Other  clauses  in  the  Constitution  protect  citizens   from  hate  speech,”  it  added.   JTA ",2000-12-22
"  Back  in  the  saddle   KIRK  Douglas  was  back  in  the  sad  dle  during  a  recent  trip  to  Israel  to  open  a  playground  in  the  Muslim  Quarter  of  Jerusalem’s  Old  City  —  the  fifth  playground  which  he  and  his  wife  Anne  have  built  in  Israel.   “It’s  like  in  the  movies  with  John   Wayne,”  the  83-year-old  actor  told  reporters  as  he  sprang  onto  a  toy  horse  at  the  playground.   The  star  of  such  classics  as  Cast  a  Giant  Shadow  and  Spartacus  said  the  playground  was  special  because  it  represented  his  hope  for  a  peaceful  future  for  Israeli  and  Arab  children.  “I  was  hoping  that  Arab  and  Israeli  children  would  play  here  together.  My  wife  and  I  are   trying  to  help  the  children  because  my  generation  has  not  done  a  good  job  of  maintaining  peace.”   Playground  director  Hala  Amas  said  she  was  grateful  that  100  chil  dren  would  now  have  a  place  to  play  among  the  crowded  alleyways  of  East  Jerusalem  (picture,  page  17).

"  Feature   Justice  Marcus  Einfeld   WHILST  on  refugee  missions  in  Bosnia  and  Kosovo  during  the  recent  wars  there,  I  had  the  oppor  tunity  to  meet  many  local  Muslim,  Orthodox  and  Catholic  people.   I  was  particularly  struck  by  the  ferocity  of  the  hatred  each  have  for  the  other.  When  innocent  loved  ones  are  killed  merely  because  they  belong  to  a  particular  reli  gious  or  ethnic  group,  it  is  not  sur  prising  that  the  relatives  of  the  vic  tims  hate  the  perpetrators.   But  the  hatreds  I  witnessed  were  not  so  simple.  For  the  hatreds  of  these  peoples  go  back  genera  tions,  and  are  still  taught  to  every  new  generation.  There  may  be  other  hatreds  of  this  type  in  this  world,  but  Balkan  hate  is  as  bad  as  any  and  more  lethal  than  most.   What  the  Nazi  Holocaust  proved  is  that  ultimately,  people  can  only  be  led  where  they  want,  or  are   prepared,  to  go.   We  Jews  can  understand  as  well  as  anyone  the  agonies  the  people  of  the  Balkans  are  experiencing.  I  told  the  people  I  met  that  we  teach  our  children  the  agonies  of  the  past  so  that  the  past  will  not  be  forgotten,  but  in  the  hope  that  they  themselves  will  not  hate  any  one.  Indeed,  these  lessons,  of  tol  erance,  understanding  and  for  giveness,  are  a  part  of  our  her  itage.  We  welcome  all  likeminded  people  on  this  pilgrimage.   Justice  Marcus  Einfeld   The  Balkan  peoples  were  not  receptive  to  this  approach.  Perhaps  they  mistake  this  concept  of  reconciliation  for  a  type  of  mutual  forgiving  and  forgetting.  But  it  is  the  perpetrators  of  the  horrors  who  must  seek  reconcilia  tion.  All  the  victims  need  do  is  lis  ten,  assess  the  sincerity  of  the  other  party  and  be  sufficiently  open-hearted  to  embrace  the  con  cept  of  putting  the  past  into  the  past.  Hopefully,  this  process  can  create  a  better  world,  so  that  our  children,  and  theirs,  will  not  have  to  relive  the  horrible  tragedies  of  the  past.   It  should  therefore  not  be  sur  prising  that  there  is  deep  concern  at  recent  developments  in  Austria  —  a  country  that,  unlike  Germany,   has  not  been  prepared  to  face  its  past.  The  election  a  few  years  ago  of  Kurt  Waldheim  as  President,  and  the  inclusion  of  a  racially  extremist  party  in  the  new  coali  tion  government  are  two  examples  of  why  reconciliation  has  been  so  difficult  with  Austria.   Some  Austrians  and  Austrian  publications  have  been  so  busy  trying  to  portray  Hitler  as  a  German  and  Beethoven  as  an  Austrian  that  they  seem  unable  to   come  to  terms  with  their  humani  tarian  obligations.  I  cannot  under  stand  why  the  major  political  par  ties  could  not  have  reached  an  accommodation  so  as  to  keep  the  racists  out  of  power.  Their  refusal  to  compromise  is  almost  as  fright  ening  as  the  Nazi-lovers’  ascen  sion  to  government.   By  contrast,  it  must  be  acknowl  edged  that  Germany  has  done  much  to  show  that  it  is  genuinely  in  search  of  reconciliation.  It  has  been  generous  with  compensation  and  reparations,  and  its  education  system  has  at  last  advanced  so   that  the  Holocaust  is  not  quite  the  invisible  happening  it  once  was.   Just  a  few  years  ago,  then  President  Von  Weisacker,  together   with  the  then-German  Chancellor  and  Opposition  Leader,  led  a  protest  march  of  millions  against  racism.  Other  than  Israel,  the  lead  ership  of  no  other  nation  has  to  my  knowledge  done  so.  Even  offi  cial  Australia  cannot  bring  itself  to  apologise  for  the  racism  and  geno  cide  we  have  inflicted  on  our  indigenous  people.   Moreover,  Germany’s  responses  to  Israel’s  economic  and  financial  needs  at  its  most  difficult  times  have  not  gone  unnoticed.  Nor  have  the  moves  by  its  young  peo  ple  to  acknowledge  and  study  the  Holocaust,  and  the  decision  to  build  a  memorial  in  Berlin  in  remembrance  of  the  Holocaust  victims.   Ironically,  in  many  ways  these  acts  of  reconciliation  have  made  the  Nazi  era  all  the  more  confus  ing.  They  make  one  wonder  how  ordinary  Germans  could  have  allowed  their  country  to  be  turned  into  an  organ  of  mass  murder.  How  did  the  nation  that  gave  the  world  Goethe  and  Beethoven,  Schiller  and  Schumann,  also  have  given  it  Auschwitz  and  Belsen,  Ravensbruck  and  Dachau?   One  of  the  most  extraordinary  aspects  of  the  Final  Solution  is  that  it  was  carried  out  as  if  in  the  ordinary  course  of  life.  All  the  apparatus  of  a  technologically  advanced  nation  were  part  of  the  scheme  —  the  stationmaster,  traindriver  and  conductor,  the  electrician,  plumber  and  engineer,  the  town  councillor,  newspaper  editor,  shopkeeper,  indeed  virtual  ly  every  man  and  woman  in  the  street.  Where  did  all  these  people  think  their  former  clients,  cus  tomers,  neighbours  and  con  stituents  all  suddenly  went?  Who  succeeded  to  their  houses  or  took  over  their  leases?  Who  acquired  their  refrigerators,  crockery  and   furniture?   In  an  affidavit  for  his  trial  at  Nuremberg,  the  notorious  Rudolf  Hess  estimated  that  three  million  people,  mostly  Jews,  were  slaugh  tered  at  Auschwitz  alone.  Later,  he  changed  it  to  1,135,000  —  every  one  of  them  a  civilian  man,  woman,  child  or  baby,  innocent  of  anything  and  everything  except  having  a  Jewish  mother.  The  Soviet  authorities  who  investigat  ed  the  camp  after  it  was  overrun  by  the  Red  Army  in  January  1945  put  the  figure  at  four  million.  By   any  estimate,  the  figure  is  massive  —  and  the  more  massive  it  is,  the  more  ordinary  people  must  have  been  involved  in  the  process.  For  greed  speaks  many  languages.  And  institutionalised  generational  hate  and  superiority  are  seen  to  justify  the  greed.   A  secret  report  of  the  German  warden  of  the  Minsk  prison  camp  disclosed  that  all  the  Jews  “had  their  gold  bridgework,  crowns  and  fillings  pulled  or  broken  out.  This  happens  always  one  to  two  hours  before  the  special  action.”  This  practice  was  followed  virtually  everywhere.  The  gold  was  melted  and,  along  with  other  valuables,  systematically  taken  from  the  con  demned  Jews,  shipped  to  the  Reichsbank.  There,  under  a  secret  agreement  between  Himmler  and  the  bank’s  ruthless  president,  Dr  Walther  Funk,  it  was  deposited  to  the  credit  of  the  SS  in  an  account  given  the  cover  name  of  Max  Heiliger.   The  Reichsbank,  in  fact,  was  overwhelmed  by  these  Max  Heiliger  deposits.  With  its  vaults  filled  to  overflowing  as  early  as  1942,  the  bank’s  profit-minded   directors  turned  the  holdings  into  cold  cash  by  disposing  of  them  through  municipal  pawnshops.   At  Nuremberg,  the  infamous  Oswald  Pohl,  Chief  of  the  Economic  Office  of  the  SS,  who  handled  the  transactions  for  this  wicked  organisation,  emphasised   One  of  the  most  extraordinary  aspects  of  the  Final  Solution  is  that  it  was  carried  out  as  if  in  the  ordinary  course  of  life.   that  the  officials  and  employees  of  the  Reichsbank  knew  very  well  the  origins  of  the  goods  they  were  pawning.  Was  the  pawn  market,  when  it  suddenly  became  over  whelmed  by  all  this  booty,  sud  denly  struck  dumb?  Did  the  pawn  brokers  and  their  employees,  fam  ilies  and  customers,  ask  no  ques  tions  about  the  unexpected  influx  of  ordinary  peoples’  wedding  rings,  watches,  eyeglasses,  brooches,  pins,  gold  and  other   valuables?   What  the  Nazi  Holocaust  proved  is  that  ultimately,  people  can  only  be  led  where  they  want,  or  are  pre  pared,  to  go.  And  regrettably,  the  evils  of  genocide  and  gross  racial  ethnic  and  religious  hatred  are  still  occurring  —  starkly  in  coun  tries  like  Sudan,  Kosovo,  Ethiopia,  and  too  many  other  places,  but  insidiously  almost  everywhere.   That  is  why  this  [symposium]  is  so  welcome  and  why  I  am  happy  to  be  taking  part  in  it.   I  congratulate  all  those  respon  sible  for  their  creative  thinking.  1  launch  it  with  enthusiasm  and  in  hope.

"  Mubarak  a  player   JERUSALEM:  When  it  comes  to  the  future  of  Jerusalem,  Yasser  Arafat  is  not  only  negoti  ating  on  behalf  of  the  Palestinians,  but  the   broader  Arab  and  Muslim  worlds.   That  is  why  Egyptian  President  Hosni  Mubarak  emerged  as  a  key  player  outside  Camp  David  —  on  a  mission  to  secure  Arab  support  for  any  concessions  the  Palestinian  Authority  president  makes,  or  at  least  not  oppose  President  Bill  Clinton’s  attempts  to  bridge  the  gaps  on  the  issue  of  sovereignty  over  Jerusalem.  Mubarak,  who  has  consult  ed  frequently  with  Arafat  throughout  the  peace  process,  travelled  to  Saudi  Arabia  to  help  unify  the  Arab  stance  on  Jerusalem.   Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  sees  Mubarak  as  important  in  the  effort  to  build  Arab  consensus  for  whatever  Arafat  negoti   ates  for  Jerusalem.   JTA ",2000-07-28

"  Stefan  BiaSogUsSd   WITHOUT  a  trace  of  irony,  an  organiser  of  Sunday’s  Muslim  rally  outside  the  Israeli  Consulate  in  Sydney  lauded  the  peaceful,  calm  behaviour  of  the  New  South  Wales  police  officers  on  duty  there.   The  behaviour  of  the  local  police—who  were  not  being  targeted  by  gunfire,  grenades  or  rocks  —  was  an  example  that  should  be  taken  up  by  the  Israeli  police,  the  organiser  said  over  a  loud  hailer  to  the  approximately  1000  people  choking   York  Street.   Earlier  in  the  weekend,  some  synagogues  in  the  eastern  suburbs  were  targeted,  and  Jews  going  to  and  from  Shabbat  services  were  threat   ened  with  assault.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman  said  community  security  had  been  heightened.  “There  have  been  a  number  of  concerning  incidents  relating  to  attacks  on  shules  and  threatened  attacks  on  individuals,”  he  said.  “One  of  the  benefits  of  multiculturalism  has  been  that,  largely,  conflicts  in  countries  of  origin  have  not  been  transported  into  Australia.  As  a  development  in  the  Australian  political  scene,  the  acts  against  Jewish  institutions  here  are  highly  regrettable  and  of  great  concern.”   Although  there  was  no  physical  violence  at  Sunday’s  demonstration,  which  was  organised  by  the  Sydney  University  Muslim  Students  Association,  the  rally  was  far  from  peaceful.   Young  men  wearing  keffiyehs  punched  the  air  to  emphasise  their  accusations  of  Israelis  being  child-killers.  The  men  linked  arms,  jumping  up  and  down,  chanting  and  screaming  while  the   painfully  familiar  cry  of  Allahu  Akbar  boomed  out  of  loudspeakers.  Palestinian,  Lebanese  and  Syrian  flags  were  waved,  and  an  Israeli  flag  was  burned.  Posters  declared  “33  years  of  Israeli  per  secution”  and  “Free  Palestine”.   Sydney  political  activist  Khaldoun  Hajaj  —  known  for  his  explicit  support  of  terrorism  (see  page  16)  —  reportedly  raised  cheers  when  he   told  the  crowd  that  Israeli  land  had  to  be  taken  by  force.  The  Sydney  Morning  Hemld  also  quoted  him  as  calling  for  solidarity  with  Hezbollah,  which  has  kidnapped  three  Israeli  soldiers  and  has  been  rocketing  Northern  Israel  from  the  sanctuary  of  Lebanon.   The  crowd  fell  silent  to  remember  Arabs  killed   during  the  battles  in  Israel  and  many  of  those  present  participated  in  prayers,  their  palms  fac  ing  upwards  in  supplication.  Then  the  chanting  and  screaming  resumed,  and  another  Israeli  flag  was  burned  before  the  crowd  slowly  dispersed.   Estimates  of  the  crowd  size  differ.  Police  Inspector  lan  Lane,  duty  officer  at  The  Rocks,  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  the  rally  was  “at  least  1000”  strong.  Media  estimates  ranged  from  400-500  by  a  television  news  cameraman  to  2000-3000  by  ABC  journalist  Bernadette  Young.  Ms  Young  said  she  was  quoted  the  figure  by  bicy  cle  police.  When  told  of  Inspector  Lane’s  figure,  she  backed  down  to  2000  before  crossing  the  street  to  talk  with  rally  organisers.   The  Sydney  Morning  Herald  reported  that  “up  to  5000  members  of  Sydney’s  Palestinian  com  munity”  rallied,  although  the  crowd  clearly  con  tained  Muslims  of  African  and  South-East  Asian  background,  as  well  as  representatives  of  assort  ed  Marxist  groups.   Mr  Rothman  said  the  media’s  reporting  of  the  size  of  Sunday’s  rally  was  “grossly  exaggerated”.   “Having  seen  the  crowd  myself  at  Hyde  Park  before  it  went  to  the  consulate,  I  would  have  esti   mated  it  at  1000.”   Even  Sydney  Morning  Herald  journalist  Malcolm  Brown,  who  wrote  the  story  about  the  rally,  admitted  that  5000  “might  have  been  a  bit  generous”.  With  disarming  honesty,  he  said  the  figure  was  “an  agreement  between  journalists”.  “Journalists  tend  to  overestimate  and  the  police  underestimate,  so  perhaps  you  could  arrive  at  a  figure  of  about  2500,”  he  said.   “Certainly  it  was  much  bigger  than  1000;  the  line  [of  marchers]  took  two  city  blocks.” ",2000-10-13
"  violence   Gil  Sedan   JERUSALEM:  The  catalyst  for  the  worst  civil  unrest  here  since  1948  may  have  been  an  Israeli  politician’s  visit  to  a  Muslim  and  Jewish  holy  site,  but  Israeli  officials  are  holding  Palestinian  lead  ers  directly  responsible  for  the  bloodshed.   Almost  50  people  —  mostly  Palestinians  —  have  been  killed  in  rioting  that  was  sparked  on  September  28,  when  Likud  Party  leader  Ariel  Sharon  visited  the  Temple  Mount  in  Jerusalem.  Bloody  riots  on  the  Temple  Mount  spread  to  the  West  Bank,  Gaza  Strip  and  parts  of  Israel,  where  Israeli  Arabs  launched  their  own  actions  against  Israel.   Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  is  urging  Palestinian  Authority  President  Yasser  Arafat  to  intervene  to  end  the  clashes.  The  consensus  in  the  Israeli  Government  is  that  Arafat  orchestrat  ed  the  riots  in  the  territories  for  his  own  political   purposes.   In  contrast,  riots  in  Israel  proper  were  seen  as  spontaneous  and  led  by  street  gangs,  with  no   clear  guiding  hands.  Acting  Foreign  Minister  Shlomo  Ben-Ami  blamed  the  Palestinian  Authority  for  the  clashes,  but  stressed  that  one  should  not  allow  the  tragic  clashes  to  derail  the  peace  process.  Although  similar  confrontations  have  occurred  in  the  past,  the  riots  over  Rosh  Hashana  were  unprecedented  in  their  magni  tude  and  in  the  use  of  arms.   Palestinian  police  opened  fire  on  Israel  Defence  Force  soldiers  in  Gaza,  Ramallah  and  Nablus.  The  IDF  responded  with  live  fire,  the  use  of  gunships  and  missiles.  As  the  fighting  intensi  fied,  Israeli  troops  rolled  out  tanks.  An  Israeli  Jewish  man  was  shot  and  killed  on  the  road  to  the  West  Bank  settlement  of  Ariel,  reportedly  when  he  stopped  to  change  a  tyre.   The  White  House  said  it  would  head  an   inquiry  of  Israeli  and  Palestinian  security  officials  to  determine  who  caused  the  violence.  They  won’t  be  able  to  meet,  however,  until  the  situa  tion  calms  down.   The  main  points  of  confrontations  in  the  terri  tories  were  in  the  Netzarim  junction  in  the  Gaza   Strip,  the  Beit-ill  junction  near  RamaUah  and  Joseph’s  Tomb  at  the  entrance  to  Nablus,  a  Palestinian  town  where  a  group  of  yeshiva  stu  dents  maintain  a  presence.   Anger  heated  up  inside  Israel  proper  after  the  broadcast  of  pictures  of  Palestinian  Mohammad  al-Darrah,  12,  who  was  shot  to  death  at  the  Netzarim  Junction—apparently  by  Israeli  fire   during  an  exchange  between  Israeli  soldiers  and  Palestinian  policemen.  Inside  Israel,  rioters  closed  off  traffic  arteries  in  Arab  towns  —  and  even  on  a  main  street  in  downtown  Jaffa,  where  a  small  community  of  20,000  Arabs  still  live.  Arab  youth  confronted  police  with  stones  and  bottles,  and  police  reported  some  cases  of  the  use  of  live   firearms  and  Molotov  cocktails.   Barak  said  the  escalation  among  Israel’s  Arabs  was  a  “very  serious  development""  and  that  the  closing  off  of  highways  and  disruption  of  every  day  life  inside  Israel  was  “unacceptable”.  He  urged  the  law  enforcement  agencies  “to  guaran  tee  order”.  He  also  called  on  the  Israeli  Arab  pub  lic  not  to  be  dictated  to  by  radical  forces,  and   urged  them  to  abide  by  the  law.   Barak  stopped  short  of  criticising  Sharon  for  his  visit  to  the  Temple  Mount,  but  an  Israeli  offi  cial  told  the  New  York  Times:  “It’s  clear  to  every  one  that  it’s  the  Sharon  show  that  created  the  original  damage”.   US  Secretary  of  State  Madeleine  Albright  also  criticised  Sharon.  Israeli  columnist  Nahum  Bamea  wrote  that  it  was  true  that  Sharon  ignited  the  match,  but  it  was  Arafat  who  provided  the  explosives.  “This  was  an  impressive  coopera  tion  between  the  Likud  and  the  Palestinian  Authority,  one  might  say  the  beginning  of  a  won  derful  friendship,”  Bamea  wrote.   Israeli  columnist  Ron  Ben-Yishai  wrote  that  Arafat  had  been  searching  for  a  development  that  would  tilt  world  public  opinion  back  towards  him.  Sharon  provided  that  opportunity,   he  wrote.   Sharon,  meanwhile,  said  he  shares  no  respon  sibility  for  the  violence.  “This  has  nothing  to  do  with  me,”  he  told  the  Washington  Post  “It’s  the   result  of  a  preplanned  campaign  by  Arafat   J1A ",2000-10-06
"  The  future  belongs  to  our  children   TELLING  TALES   DONNA  JACOBS  SIFE   ONE  thing  for  sure.  A  new  year  has  begun.  Not  ouryear,  of  course;  that  ends  in  Elul  and  begins  in  Tishrei.  It’s  not  the  Chinese  new  year  either,  theirs  is  at  the  end  of  January;  nor  the  Muslim,  nor  the  Buddhist.  The  Aborigines  are  in  the  40th  millennium,  I  believe.  In  fact,  let’s  face  it,  this  millennium  thing  belongs  to  the   Christians.   Two  thousand  years  since  the  birth  of  Jesus,  although  most  scholars  agree  that  they  got  the  year  wrong.  We,  on  the  other  hand,  are  count  ing  from  the  creation  of  Adam,  six  days  after  the  Creation  of  the  World  —  5760  years.   Between  you  and  me,  I  suspect  the  world  has  been  around  longer  than  that.  I  hold  with  in  me  the  knowledge  that  the  Earth  was  creat  ed  at  the  time  of  the  Big  Bang  several  hundred  million  years  ago,  and  at  the  same  time  can  embrace  the  idea  that  monotheism,  when  humanity  was  created  in  the  image  of  God,  is  probably  around  5760  years  old.   That  is  when  Judaism  imposed  herself  upon  the  Great  Stories  of  the  world,  and  added  her  unique  and  extraordinary  perspective  to  the  Sumerian,  Ugaritic,  Canaanite  and  Babylonian  mythologies,  changing  the  world  forever.  Surely  a  moment  to  celebrate.   If  we  see  ourselves  as  members  of  the  plan  et,  with  a  shared  home  —  that  of  Earth;  if  we  see  ourselves  as  part  of  one  great  family,  with   one  Great  Story  to  tell  —  that  of  the  birth  and  evolution  of  faith  and  ideas,  of  humans’  rela  tionship  with  God  and  each  other  —  these  numbers  can  seem  quite  irrelevant.   Each  People  of  the  Earth  have  their  own  time  frame  and  Creation  story.  They  represent  signposts  in  the  evolution  of  humanity.  And  each  one  of  us  benefits  from  the  experiences  of  the  other.  As  new  ideas  are  formed,  we  all  absorb,  translate,  resonate  or  reject  them  —  re-forming  our  own  relationships  with  God  and  the  Universe.  Seen  this  way,  not  only  is  the  Earth  a  living  breathing  organism,  humanity  is   too.   Having  said  that,  I  was  left  with  a  dilemma:  how  was  I  to  mark  this  new  year?  Was  I  to  steadfastly  claim  that  it  had  nothing  to  do  with  me  and  have  a  quiet  night  at  home,  keeping  an  eye  on  my  computer-dependent  appliances  for  strange  signs  of  malfunction?  Sit  outside,  wishing  there  were  more  stars  and  watching  out  for  falling  planes?  Was  I  to  join  the  throngs  in  a  desperate  desire  to  have  fun  by  finding  a  party  with  ear-splitting  music,  copious  amounts  of  alcohol  and  geared  towards  watch  ing  millions  of  dollars  turn  into  coloured  gun  powder,  that  lasted  for  a  moment,  leaving  our  city  polluted  and  smelling  of  war?  Or  should  I  have  gathered  a  few  friends  and  held  deep  dis  cussions  as  to  the  relevance  of  the  moment,  debated  the  nuance  of  date  and  time  and  when  the  Christian  millennium  really  began,  and  what  we  can  do  to  change  the  world  before  we  go  back  to  work?   What  I  did  in  fact  do  was  head  down  early  to  MacMahons  Point,  as  I  do  every  year.  Set  out  a   picnic  with  my  sister  and  her  family,  and  some  other  friends  who  came.  Sat  and  watched  the  myriad  of  people  gather  —  my  community  of  Sydney  —  and  delighted  in  their  different  colours,  languages,  foods,  customs,  dress.  We  watched  the  sun  descend  together,  sometimes  breaking  out  into  song  or  Mexican  waves  at  the  boats  that  gathered  on  the  harbour.  We  chatted  to  strangers,  felt  the  rising  sense  of  shared  occasion.  There  was  the  same  cama  raderie  and  joyful  spirit  as  there  is  every  year  on  the  banks  of  the  harbour.  Probably  more.   I  don’t  need  much  encouragement  to  cele  brate,  or  impose  significance  upon  a  moment.  The  fact  that  four  numbers  turn  over  on  the  digital  calender  is  enough.  That  we  are  brought  together  to  mark  the  passing  of  time  is  enough  to  warrant  my  contemplation,  my  optimism  and  my  participation.   I  look  around  and  marvel  at  our  freedom  here  in  Sydney.  Our  freedom  to  live  side  by  side  with  tolerance  and  mutual  respect.  It  is  an  extraordinary  achievement;  more  than  that,  a  privilege.  Amongst  my  neighbours  that  night,  there  were  those  who  have  lived  through  war  and  poverty,  immigration,  loss  of  family,  lan  guage,  culture,  safety.  Their  histories  con  spired  to  bring  them  here,  now  —  on  Sydney  Harbour,  as  the  calendar  clicked  over  to  read  2000.  Some  prayed  for  a  better  life,  some  wept  for  what  they  do  not  have,  some  gave  thanks  for  what  they  do.  I  joined  them.   As  a  member  of  the  planet,  this  is  a  chance  to  see  from  whence  we  come,  and  to  decide  where  we  shall  go  from  here.  It  doesn’t  matter  to  whom  this  really  belongs.  What  matters  is   what  we  do  with  it.  The  future  belongs  to  our  children.  My  nephew  showed  me  a  poem  he  wrote  for  the  new  millennium.

"  Antisemites  unite,  urges  Duke   MOSCOW:  A  former  Ku  Klux  Klan  leader  is  spreading  his  antisemitic  message  across  Russia.  But  the  real  message  is  that  there  appears  to  be  increasing  co-operation  between  Russian  extremists  and  their  ideological  coun  terparts  abroad.   David  Duke  recently  began  a  one-month  trip  to  Russia  by  telling  a  crowd  at  a  downtown  Moscow  museum  that  they  should  take  action  against  “the  Aryan  race’s  main  enemy  —  World  Zionism”  and  that  “the  Jews  have  brought  us  to  our  knees”,  the  Union  of  Councils  for  Soviet  Jews  reported.   He  apparently  embarked  on  his  trip  at  the  invitation  of  Aleksander  Prokhanov,  editor  of  Zavtra  —  an  ultra-nationalist  newspaper  —  and  Konstantin  Kasimovsky,  head  of  an  antisemitic  organisation  known  as  Russian  Action.  Prokhanov’s  newspaper  is  tainted  with  xeno  phobia  and  antisemitism.   Speaking  at  the  museum,  Duke  called  for  all  dark-skinned  people  to  be  forced  out  of  Moscow.  The  crowd  responded  with  cries  of  “Glory  to  RussiaTand  “White  Power!”   The  national  director  of  a  group  that  monitors  antisemitic  acts  and  other  human  rights  viola  tions  in  Russia  said  Duke’s  visit  was  throwing  the  spotlight  on  Russian  President  Vladimir   Putin’s  flirtation  with  Russian  extremists.   This  is  Duke’s  second  trip  to  Russia.  Last  year  he  met  General  Albert  Makashov,  a  former  Communist  Member  of  Parliament  known  for   antisemitic  statements.   In  May,  Jean-Marie  Le  Pen,  leader  of  France’s  xenophobic  National  Front,  visited  Ukraine  and  signed  a  collaboration  agreement  with  the  Ukrainian  National  Socialist  Party  —  a  leading  extreme-right  organisation  in  western  Ukraine.   Lev  Krichevsky,  director  of  the  Moscow  office   of  the  Anti-Defamation  League,  said  extreme  Russian  nationalists  are  stepping  up  contacts  with  their  counterparts  in  the  West,  including  the  sharing  of  internet  resources.  “It  is  amazing  to  see  how  fast  these  guys,  with  all  their  anti  Western  rhetoric,  find  common  language  and  organize  multi-language  websites  together  with  their  colleagues  from  the  West,”  Krichevsky   said.   There  are  also  signs  of  co-operation  between  Muslim  extremists  and  nationalists  across  the  former  Soviet  Union.

"  ANALYSIS   Gil  Sedan   JERUSALEM:  It  was  a  rare  phenome  non  in  Israeli  public  life.   Leading  Israeli  personalities,  from  writer  Amos  Oz  on  the  left  to  former  Defence  Minister  Moshe  Arens  on  the  right,  were  among  those  signing  an  advertisement  published  in  newspa  pers  protesting  against  the  “intolera  ble  archaeological  crime”  being  per  petrated  by  Muslim  officials  on  Jerusalem’s  Temple  Mount.   The  advertisement,  which  was  also  signed  by  75  Knesset  members  from  across  the  political  spectrum,  attacked  massive  construction  work  conducted  by  the  Wakf  (the  Islamic  religious  authority),  aimed  at  expand  ing  their  places  of  worship  on  the   Mount.   The  petition  urged  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  to  take  immediate  action  to  stop  the  Wakf  from  continuing  the  work.  But  Barak  refused  to  take  such  a  step.   In  recent  months,  thousands  of  tons  of  gravel  were  removed  from  the  construction  site,  including  a  consid  erable  number  of  archaeological  arti  facts,  the  advertisement  charged.  It  also  said  the  work  was  being  con  ducted  with  no  supervision  from  archaeologists.   “I  signed  the  petition  as  an  archae  ologist,  not  as  a  politician,”  Professor  Trude  Dotan  of  the  Hebrew  University  said.  “You  don’t  dig  in  such  a  sensitive   site  with  bulldozers.”   The  controversy  erupted  just  as  Israel  was  trying  to  persuade  the  Palestinian  Authority  to  conclude  a  final  peace  agreement  that  would  defer  what  is  perhaps  the  most  sensi  tive  issue  confronting  them  —  Jerusalem  —  for  future  negotiations.   The  advertisement  was  the  latest  chapter  in  the  ongoing  controversy  over  Jerusalem  and  who  would  exert  control  over  its  very  heart  —  the  Temple  Mount.   For  the  past  two  years,  Islamic  offi  cials,  supported  by  volunteers  and  money  from  Israeli  Arabs,  have  been  engaged  in  massive  construction  works  on  the  Mount.  Among  their  goals  is  the  construction  of  a  third  mosque  to  join  the  Al-Aksa  and  Dome  of  the  Rock  mosques  already  at  the  site.  Israeli  officials  did  not  interfere.   A  B  Yehoshua,  one  of  Israel’s  fore  most  writers,  said  he  is  not  concerned  that  his  having  signed  the  advertise  ment  may  help  right-wingers  in  their  campaign  against  Israel’s  making  any  concessions  regarding  Jerusalem.  “Palestinians  should  be  concerned  not  to  harm  archaeological  assets  no  less  then  Jews,”  he  said.  “I  followed   my  conscience.  In  my  view,  sovereign  ty  in  the  Old  City  of  Jerusalem  should  be  multi-religious,  and  the   Palestinians  should  have  their  share.   But  one  cannot  always  justify  the   Arabs.”   Not  all  archaeologists  agree  that   ""Sovereignty  in  the  Old  City  of  Jerusalem  should  be  multi-religious,  and  the  Palestinians   should  have  their  share.  But  one  cannot  always  justify  the  Arabs.”   the  digging  has  caused  damage.  Veteran  archaeologist  Meir  Ben-Dov,  an  expert  on  digs  around  the  Temple  Mount,  downplayed  the  importance  of  the  artifacts  that  were  removed  from  the  site.   Jerusalem  Mayor  Ehud  Olmert  is  firmly  on  the  other  side  of  the  debate.  According  to  Olmert,  a  supply  line  of  construction  material  should  be  cut   off  at  Lion’s  Gate  —  the  eastern   entrance  point  to  the  Old  City.  This,  he  reasons,  would  spare  the  need  to  enter  the  Temple  Mount  in  order  to  put  an  end  to  the  work.   “No  one  suggests  that  we  storm  into  the  Temple  Mount  compound   with  bayonets,”  said  Olmert,  but  “cau  tious,  intelligent”  action  should  be  taken  “in  order  for  us  to  regain  control  of  the  Temple  Mount”.   Barak  is  in  a  bind.  When  the  fate  of  a  US-hosted  peace  summit  aimed  at  reaching  a  final  Israeli-Palestinian  peace  deal  is  touch  and  go,  a  potential  flare-up  over  Jerusalem  is  about  the  last  thing  he  needs.   Following  high-level  consultations  last  week,  Barak  gave  Muslim  officials  approval  to  continue  with  tiling  work  on  the  Mount,  as  long  as  no  archaeo  logical  damage  is  done.   The  Prime  Minister  rejected  a  rec  ommendation  by  Attorney-General   Elyakim  Rubinstein  and  the  Israel  Antiquities  Authority  to  halt  or  limit  the  work.  He  also  vetoed  Olmert’s  rec  ommendation  to  prevent  the  entry  of  heavy  machinery,  trucks  and  tractors  to  the  Temple  Mount.  Just  the  same,  Barak  directed  Israeli  officials  to  main  tain  “reasonable  supervision”  of  the  traffic  entering  and  leaving  the  com  pound.   “We  will  do  everything  to  maintain  the  status  quo,  but  not  to  change  it  —  not  in  our  favour  and  not  in  anyone  else’s  favour,”  said  Danny  Yatom,  Barak’s  senior  security  adviser.  The  “status  quo”  principle  won  unexpect  ed  support  last  week,  when  Sephardi  Chief  Rabbi  Eliyahu  Bakshi-Doron  sent  letters  to  Muslim  and  Christian   clergymen,  stating  for  the  first  time  by  Israel’s  highest  rabbinical  authority  that  the  status  quo  on  the  Temple  Mount  should  be  preserved,  because  any  change  “could  desecrate  the  sanctity  of  the  site  and  lead  to  blood   shed.”   The  letters  infuriated  the  extreme   right.  “Even  if  you  are  a  Chief  Rabbi,”  said  Itamar  Ben-Gvir,  a  former  activist  in  the  now-banned  Kach  movement,  “you  cannot  decide  that  the  House  of  God  will  be  under  Palestinian  admin  istration.  This  is  definitely  crossing  a  red  line.  This  is  a  black  day.”   Indeed,  Barak  is  also  concerned  that  right-wing  extremists,  agitated  by  the  Wakf’s  construction  work,  may  try  to  break  into  the  site  or  take  other   action  to  protest  the  damage  they  claim  is  being  done  to  sacred  Jewish  antiquities  at  the  site,  where  the  First  and  Second  Temples  stood.   The  Arab  presence  in  Jerusalem  dates  back  to  638,  when  a  Muslim  army  conquered  the  city.  According  to  Muslim  tradition,  Omar  Ibn  al  Khattab,  the  second  Khalif  of  Islam,  accompanied  by  hundreds  of  Muslims,  entered  the  Temple  Mount,  where,  according  to  Moslem  tradition,  the  Prophet  Mohammad  ascended  to  Heaven.  Omar  immediately  ordered  a  major  clean-up  of  the  site  and  erected  a  huge  timber  mosque  for  3000  wor  shipers.  This  eventually  became  the  Al-Aksa  Mosque.   Now,  the  Islamic  authorities  are  determined  not  to  allow  any  Israeli   intervention.   In  a  Friday  sermon,  Sheikh  Akrameh  Sabri,  Grand  Mufti  of  Jerusalem,  said  Islamic  officials  would  not  ask  permission  from  anyone  to  carry  out  work  on  the  site.  “We  have  never  asked  for  permits,  and  we  do  not  intend  to  do  so  today,”  said  the  Mufti,  the  highest  Islamic  official  in   Jerusalem.   Meanwhile,  Sheikh  Najah  Bakirat  of  the  Islamic  Movement,  a  leading  Israeli  Arab  political  party,  insisted   that  the  construction  has  caused  no  damage.  “I  can  assure  you  that  during  the  construction  work  we  have  found  no  Jewish  artefacts”,  he  said.  He  also  maintained  that  there  was  “no  proof  that  the  site  was  the  location  of  the  First  and  Second  Temples.  “I  suggest  that  the  Jews  look  for  the  Temple   somewhere  else,  he  said.

"  Aussie  transmitters  to  broadcast  Christian  messages  to  Asia   Muslims  to  retaliate  with  all  day  Cat  Stevens  broadcasts   DARWIN,  Sunday:  The  Australian  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  Government  has  leased  a  former  Radio  Australia  transmitter  near  Darwin  to  a  British  Christian  funda-  mentalist  group  called  Christian  Voice.  The  group  plans  to  use  the   transmitter  to  broadcast  their  Christian  message  to  a  predominantly  Islamic  South-East  Asia,  an  area  renown  for  religious  tension.  But  Indonesia's  Muslim  President  Wahid  has  vowed  to  retaliate  by  broadcasting  Muslim  pop-artist,  Cat  Steven's  songs  24  hours  a  day  until  Australia  backs  down.  ""We  think  that  Yussuf  Islam,  as  he  is  now  known,  will  have  much  to  teach  the  heathens  in  Australia.  We'll  be  playing  the  song  'Cat's  in  the  Cradle',  that  was  so  mov  ingly  covered  by  Ugly  Kit  Joe.  And  then  there's  his  instructive  song  that  explains  what  to  do  when  you're  being  followed  by  a  moonshadow.""  The  Foreign  Minister,  Mr  Alexander  Downer,  is  taking  the  diplomatic  situ-  ation  seriously  but  has  been  unwilling  to  stop  the  deal.  ""While  I  don't  condone  religious  fundamentalism,""  Mr  Downer  said,  ""at  least  it's  our  kind  of  fundamental-  ism.""  Meanwhile,  the  chairman  of  the   ABC,  Mr  Donald  McDonald,  has  defended  the  original  decision  to  close  the  Radio  Australia  transmitter  in  Darwin  and  move  it  to  southern  Victoria.  ""It  was  a  necessary  cost-cutting  decision,  brought  on  by  a  Federal  Government  that  very  well  under-  stands  the  needs  of  our  region  and  our  place  in  it.

"  Opinion   Letters   Violence  was  triggered  by  Arafat   WITH  overwhelming  consensus,  the   international  media  blames  Ariel   Sharon’s  visit  to  the  Temple  Mount  for  triggering  the  latest  round  of   Palestinian  violence.  This  is  a  com   plete  misrepresentation  of  reality.  The  violence  and  the  killing  actually  began  before  Sharon’s  trip  to  the  Temple   Mount.   On  September  13,  Arafat’s  self  imposed  deadline  for  achieving  Palestinian  statehood  expired  without  a  Palestinian  state  being  declared.  On  the  same  day,  Molotov  cocktails  and  stones  were  thrown  at  Israeli  positions  at  Netzarim  Junction  in  the  Gaza  Strip.  This  was  followed  by  a  number  of  increasingly  violent  incidents,  culmi  nating  in  the  death  of  an  Israeli  soldier  by  a  roadside  bomb  near  Netzarim  on  September  27.   The  next  day,  September  28,  Sharon  toured  the  Temple  Mount,  as  do  thou  sands  of  Jewish  and  Muslim  visitors  every  year.  The  following  day,  Muslim  worshippers  at  the  site  pelted  Jews  praying  at  the  Western  Wall  below  with  stones.  From  there,  Palestinian  violence  spread  rapidly  throughout  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  Strip.   Following  the  failure  of  die  Camp  David  talks  in  July,  Arafat  and  the  Palestinian  Authority  suffered  major  blows  to  their  credibility  in  the  eyes  of  the  international  community.  Prime  Minister  Barak  had  offered  unprece  dented  concessions  in  the  negotia  tions,  whereas  Arafat  remained  inflexi  ble  and  intransigent.   This  return  to  the  use  of  violence  by  Palestinians  is  a  calculated  tactic  by  Arafat  to  win  back  the  moral  high  ground  by  portraying  Israel  as  a  brutal   oppressor.  Arafat  is  hoping  that  this  strategy  will  apply  pressure  on  Israel  to  make  even  more  far-reaching  con  cessions  in  the  deadlocked  peace  negotiations.  As  always,  the  Palestinian  leadership  has  no  com  punction  about  using  their  civilians,  including  children,  as  cannonfodder  for  political  advantage.   Ariel  Sharon’s  untimely  trip  to  the  Temple  Mount  played  straight  into  the  hands  of  the  Palestinian  leadership  by  providing  the  latter  with  a  pretext  to  step  up  violent  actions  which  they  had  clearly  planned  to  carry  out  in  any   event.

"  More  than  1500  North  and  Latin   American  Jews  have  flown  to  Israel  In  a   gesture  of  solidarity  during  the  current   crisis,  which  erupted  seven  weeks  ago.   The  highlight  was  a  rally  (pictured   above)  and  a  march  from  Zion  Gate  to  the  Western  Wall  Plaza,  where  they  danced  and  sang,  before  going  on  to  the  President’s   Residence.

After  the  African  National  Congress  organised  a  Palestinian  solidarity  demonstration  in  Cape  Town  last  month,  South  African  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  officials  met  Foreign  Ministry  officials  to  express  concern.  “We  were  given  a  wonderfully  warm  reception,”  Board  chairman  Russell  Gaddin  said.  “Their  agenda  is  Middle  East  peace,  and  they  want  to  be  even   handed.”   The  delegation  was  assured  that  “any  anti-Israel  feeling  pertaining  to   Israel’s  links  with  the  old  South  African  Government  was  yesterday’s  history”,  he  added.   Foreign  Ministry  and  Jewish  offi  cials  issued  a  statement  that  both  par  ties  “make  an  earnest  appeal  to  the  Muslim  and  Jewish  communities  in  South  Africa  not  to  let  the  Middle  East  conflict  lead  to  disturbances  in  South  Africa.  Any  statements,  protests  and  demonstrations  in  favour  of  either  side  should  be  peaceful  and  non  provocative.  We  appeal  to  both  sides  in  South  Africa  to  ensure  that  their  support  for  what  happens  in  the  Middle  East  should  not  inflame  pas  sions  in  our  country  and  should   ensure  that  civil  peace  will  prevail.”   The  violence  was  the  subject  of  a   heated  debate  in  the  South  African  Parliament,  where  MPs  criticised  Israel’s  role  in  the  clashes.  Gaddin  said  he  was  disappointed  that  the  debate  had  taken  place.  “Such  a  debate  was  nothing  less  than  opportunism  to  catch  Muslim  votes,  particularly  in  Cape  Town,”  where  municipal  elec  tions  are  due  next  month,  he  said.   The  (Jewish)  leader  of  the  opposi  tion  Democratic  Alliance  Party,  Tony  Leon,  said  that  by  debating  the  Middle  East  crisis,  ANC  MPs  were  “importing  foreign  conflicts  for   domestic  political  gain  .

"  US  ELECTION  November  7,2000   Matthew  Berger   WASHINGTON:  At  times,  the  race  for  the  US  Senate  seat  from  New  York  appears  to  focus  on  the  Middle  East  as  much  as  it  does  on  Empire  State  politics.   That  is  because  US  First  Lady  Hillary  Rodham  Clinton  and  Congressman  Rick  Lazio  are  both  battling  for  the  crucial  Jewish  vote  to  help  give  them  the  winning  edge.   Clinton,  like  most  Democratic  Senate  candi  dates  in  the  past,  is  likely  to  capture  most  of   New  York’s  Jewish  vote.   However,  the  margin  of  the  Democratic  lead  appears  to  be  lower  than  in  previous  elections  —  one  poll  has  Clinton’s  Jewish  support  as  low  as  63  percent.  A  Lazio  campaign  aide  said  he  thinks  the  Long  Island  congressman  could  carry  between  35  and  45  percent  of  the  Jewish  vote.   The  reason,  the  aide  said,  is  that  Jews  are  frustrated  with  Clinton’s  perceived  blunders  when  it  comes  to  Israel  and  the  Middle  East  peace  process.  Most  notably,  during  her  trip  to  the  Middle  East  in  November  1999,  Clinton  failed  to  respond  immediately  to  allegations  made  by  Suha  Arafat,  the  wife  of  the  Palestinian  Authority  President,  that  Israel  poisoned  the  Palestinian  population’s  water  supply.  Clinton  later  said  she  did  not  receive  a  proper  transla  tion  of  Arafat’s  remarks.   The  First  Lady  has  also  found  it  difficult  to  distance  herself  from  remarks  she  made  two   years  ago,  when  she  said  the  creation  of  a  Palestinian  state  would  be  in  the  long-term  interests  of  the  region.   Most  recently,  Clinton  returned  campaign  donations  from  a  US  Muslim  leader  who  had  supported  the  Hamas  terrorist  group.  The  $US1000  donation  by  Abudrahman  Alamoudi  of  the  American  Muslim  Council  again  put  Jewish  leaders  at  odds  with  the  Clinton  campaign.  But  the  First  Lady  was  quick  to  return  the  money,  plus  $US50,000  of  additional  contributions  from   Muslim  leaders.   The  Lazio  campaign  has  been  quick  to  high  light  the  areas  where  Clinton  and  the  Jewish  community  have  been  at  odds.  “It  has  planted  a  seed  of  doubt  in  the  minds  of  the  Jewish  com  munity,”  said  the  Lazio  aide,  who  spoke  on  con  dition  of  anonymity.  “Those  who  traditionally   US  First  Lady  Hillary  Rodham  Clinton   supported  Democrats  have  some  very  serious  doubts  about  whether  she  would  be  a  friend  of  Israel.”   Both  campaigns  are  pumping  up  their  sup  port  for  Israel  as  they  hit  the  Jewish  campaign  circuit  at  synagogues  and  community  forums.   With  tension  high  in  the  Middle  East,  the  Clinton  campaign  has  been  able  to  make  up   Congressman  Rick  Lazio   some  lost  ground  as  she  speaks  extensively  about  Israel  and  the  Middle  East  peace  process  —  issues  which  both  candidates  see  as  close  to  Jewish  voters’  hearts.  A  Jewish  adviser  to  the  Clinton  campaign  said  the  candidate  has  sought  out  the  entire  Jewish  community,  from  Chassidic  to  Reform  Jews,  and  has  embraced  the  meet  ings  as  opportunities  to  respond  to  concerns   about  the  earlier  controversies.   She  answers  the  questions  directly,  said  the  aide,  who  also  spoke  on  condition  of  anonymi  ty.  “It  offers  a  chance  to  dispel  rumours  that  are  out  there  —distortions  and  half-truths.”   New  York  has  had  several  Jewish  Democratic  Senate  candidates,  including  current  Senator  Charles  Schumer,  who  won  in  1998,  and  former  Attorney-General  Robert  Abrams,  who  lost  to  Alfonse  d’Amato  in  1992.  And  since  neither  can  didate  is  Jewish  in  this  year’s  battle,  talking  about  Israel  is  the  way  to  show  an  alliance  with  Jewish  New  Yorkers.   “I  don’t  think  any  candidate  should  take  any  vote  for  granted,”  the  Clinton  adviser  said.  “Jews  are  not  monolithic  voters.  If  you  are  try  ing  to  reach  the  Jewish  voters,  it  is  going  to  help  you  with  other  communities  as  well  ”   Although  it  does  not  make  up  a  laige  per   centage  oi  me  mew  iorK  state  vote,  uie  jewisu   vote  has  often  been  seen  as  a  key  voting  bloc  to  gain  statewide  office,  said  pollster  Mickey   Carroll.   About  10  years  ago,  the  Jewish  vote  made  up  close  to  one-third  of  the  Democratic  vote  in  New  York  City,  and  it  has  become  commonplace  for  Democratic  candidates  to  court  it.  “The  Jewish  vote  tended  to  be  a  vote  that  knew  what  the  hell  was  going  on,”  Carroll  said.  “It’s  a  vote  that  politicians  take  seriously,  maybe  out  of  propor  tion  to  itSjiiumbers.”   The  courtship  has  paid  off  in  some  of  the  Jewish  media.  New  York  area  Jewish  newspa  pers  endorsing  Clinton  are  The  Forward,  the  Long  Island  Jewish  World,  Manhattan  Jewish  Sentinel  and  the  Westchester/Rockland  Jewish  Tribune.   But  the  Lazio  campaign  has  been  taking  the  Jewish  vote  seriously,  too,  making  almost  as  many  Jewish  campaign  appearances  as  Clinton.  “Historically,  the  Jewish  vote  in  New  York  races  has  always  been  seen  as  a  barometer,”  said  Lazio  spokesman  Michael  Marr.  “If  a  Republican  can  get  a  certain  percentage  of  the  Jewish  vote,  he  has  a  good  chance  of  winning  the  election.”   According  to  a  poll  by  Zogby  International,  Clinton’s  support  from  likely  Jewish  voters  has  tapered  off  to  63  percent  from  71  percent  less  than  a  month  ago.  Lazio’s  Jewish  support  also  decreased  in  the  last  month,  but  many  more  Jewish  voters  have  either  embraced  third-party  candidates  or  are  now  undecided.   “I  think  the  polls  have  gone  back  and  forth  like  that  throughout  this  campaign,”  said  Clinton  spokeswoman  Cathie  Levine.  “As  we  approach  election  day  and  people  focus  on  what  is  important  to  them,  Hillary’s  support  will  continue  to  grow.”   But  as  they  press  the  flesh  with  Jewish  lead  ers,  saying  what  the  community  wants  to  hear  about  the  Middle  East  and  Israel,  both  candi  dates  run  the  risk  of  alienating  other  important  voting  groups.   James  Zogby,  president  of  the  American  Arab  Institute,  said  he  wishes  he  could  get  his  $US500  contribution  to  the  Clinton  campaign  back   because  of  the  return  of  the  Muslim  money.   Zogby  has  also  criticised  the  way  Lazio  has  seized  on  the  latest  incident.  “What  is  going  on  in  New  York  is  shameful,”  said  Zogby,  who  now  serves  as  Vice-President  A1  Gore’s  campaign  adviser  on  ethnic  affairs.  “People  in  the  Jewish  community  should  speak  out  and  say  they  don’t  want  this  to  go  on.  It’s  pandering.”   jin ",2000-11-03

"  Sex,  drugs,  rock  *n  roll   THE  Shalom  Institute  is  to  host  a  forum  next  week  under  the  topic  “Sex,  Drugs,  Rock  ‘n’   Roll”.   A  joint  initiative  of  the  World  Council  on  Religion  and  Peace  (WCRP)  and  Hillel  Student  Services,  the  event  will  take  place  on  August  22  in  the  form  of  a  multi-faith  panel  discussing  reli  gious  perspectives  on  the  three  phenomena.   The  panel  will  consist  of  representatives  of  the  Jewish  community  (Rabbi  Jacqueline  Ninio);  Baha’i  (Pouya  Ehsani);  Christianity   (Reverend  Andrew  Collis);  Hinduism  (Paul  Cowan);  and  Muslim  community  (Ahmed   Abdo).

"  Christian  supporters  denounce  “racist”  attack   CANBERRA   FILE   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   QUEENSLAND-BASED  Christian  sup  porters  of  Israel  have  attacked  as  false  and  “an  utter  waste  of  our  gov  ernment’s  time  and  money”  a  call  by  Palestinian  representative  in  Australia  Ali  Kazak  to  cancel  the  tax  exempt  status  of  the  “racist”  Jewish  National  Fund  and  other  Australian  fundraising  appeals  for  Israel.   In  a  2500-word  submission  to  the  Federal  Parliament’s  Joint  Foreign  Affairs,  Defence  and  Trade  Committee,  the  fundamentalist  Christians’  Israel  Public  Action  Campaign  (CIPAC)  said  it  disagrees  with  almost  every  statement  which  Mr  Kazak  made  last  September  to  the  committee’s  human  rights  inquiry  into  Australia’s  efforts  to  pro  mote  and  protect  freedom  of  religion   and  belief.   The  CIPAC  submission,  which  the  parliamentary  committee  will  con  sider  at  a  meeting  this  year,  says:  “Ali  Kazak’s  presentation  was  riddled  with  concocted  facts,  misrepresenta  tions  and  lies.  With  these  he  has  woven  a  story  designed  to  elicit  sym  pathy  for  the  Palestinian  Authority  and  to  unleash  indignation  on  the   Israeli  Government.”   When  Mr  Kazak  appeared  before  the  committee,  he  described  “horrif  ic  details  of  gross  violations  commit  ted  by  Israel  against  the  religious   freedom  of  Christians  and  Moslems”,  including  allegations  that  Israel  con  tinues  to  desecrate  Moslem  grave  yards,  mosques  and  holy  sites  and  to  impose  a  “racist”  Law  of  Return  and  other  discriminatory  laws.   Questioned  about  these  claims  at  a  subsequent  session  of  the  parlia  mentary  committee,  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  presi  dent  Nina  Bassat  and  national  vice  president  Jeremy  Jones  explained  that  JNF  funds  raised  in  Australia  were  for  environmental  purposes,  that  Israel  protected  religious  free  doms  to  a  much  larger  degree  than  is  generally  understood  and  that  its  Law  of  Return  was  not  an  abuse  of  religious  freedom.   CIPAC,  which  includes  a  small  Star  of  David  in  its  letterhead  and  says  it  was  “founded  to  educate  and  mobilise  Christians  on  behalf  of  sound  legislation  and  policies  towards  Israel”,  frequently  backs  its  arguments  in  support  of  Israel  with  biblical  quotations.   In  the  recent  past,  it  has  called  for  Australia  to  move  its  embassy  from  Tel  Aviv  to  Jerusalem.  In  its  latest  submission,  it  describes  Jerusalem  as  “the  spiritual  and  political  capital  only  of  the  Jewish  people  for  3000  years”,  and  says  “there  is  ample  his  torical,  archaeological  and  biblical   ""Israel  has  in  fact  granted  more  religious  freedom  in  the  Old  City   than  has  any  ruling  power  for   hundreds  of  years.”   evidence”  to  support  Israel’s  right  to  Jerusalem  as  its  capital.   In  its  comments  on  Mr  Kazak’s  claim  that  Israel  breaches  Muslim  rights  to  religious  freedom  and  has  destroyed  Muslim  holy  sites,  CIPAC’s  submission  says:  “Israel  has  in  fact  granted  more  religious  freedom  in  the  Old  City  than  has  any  ruling  power  for  hundreds  of  years”.   It  says  the  long-established  exis  tence  of  Christian  churches  and  min  istries  contradicts  claims  of  wide  spread  Israeli  abuse  of  the  religious  freedom  of  the  Christian  population  of  Israel.  “While  Christian  tourists  enjoy  a  sense  of  security  while  visit  ing  holy  sites  under  Israeli  control,  they  seldom  venture  to  such  sites  in   Palestinian-controlled  areas  as  Shechem,  Solomon’s  Pools  and  Hebron  due  to  the  high  security  risk,”  it  states.   The  submission  says  Mr  Kazak  blamed  the  Palestinians’  unfortunate  situation  entirely  on  the  Israeli  Government,  while  ignoring  human  rights  abuses  of  its  own  people  by  the  Palestinian  Authority,  including  censorship  of  broadcasts  about  offi  cial  corruption,  misappropriation  of  funds,  torture  in  Palestinian  jails  and  a  death  penalty  for  selling  land  to   Jews.   It  says  that  while  Mr  Kazak  noted  several  “massacres”  which  he  claimed  were  perpetrated  by  the  Israeli  Government  against  the  Palestinian  people,  he  did  not  bal  ance  it  with  documented  massacres  by  Arabs  against  Jewish  people.   The  submission  dismisses  Mr  Kazak’s  claim  that  no  Arab  or  Christian  may  serve  in  the  Israel  Defence  Force,  pointing  out  that  the  defence  establishment  has  expressed  a  clear  interest  in  encour  aging  Christian  and  Muslim  volun   teers.  It  counters  his  claim  of  racism   in  the  Israeli  education  system  by  cit  ing  examples  of  anti-Jewish  state  ments  in  Palestinian  schoolbooks  and  quoting  from  a  Palestinian  Authority  TV  show  in  which  five   year-olds,  surrounded  by  teddy  bears  and  Disney  murals,  recite  bloodthirsty  slogans  advocating  vio  lence  and  suicide  as  a  means  to  an  end.   CIPAC’s  members,  while  claiming  not  to  be  directly  involved,  support  a  resolution  which  reached  the  federal  council  of  the  National  Party  —  the  party’s  top  policy  body  —  last  September,  strongly  supporting  Israel  and  calling  for  the  Coalition  Government  to  recognise  Jerusalem  as  Israel’s  capital.  The  resolution  originated  in  the  National  Party’s  Nicklin  electorate  council,  at  Nambour,  on  Queensland’s  Sunshine  Coast,  and  was  later  adopted  at  the  Queensland  National  Party’s  state  conference.  But  it  was  hastily  with  drawn  at  the  federal  council  conven  tion  in  Canberra  amid  embarrassed  —  and  inaccurate  —  claims  from  senior  party  figures  that  it  had  not  gone  through  the  proper  channels  to  be  included  in  federal  council’s  agen   da.   CIPAC  has  since  sought  an  assur  ance  from  Queensland  National  Party  president  Terry  Bolger  that  the  resolution  will  go  to  the  National  Party  federal  convention  at  Tweed  Heads  in  June.  CIPAC  president  Trish  Small  says  they  are  awaiting  a   response. ",2000-01-07
"  Jerusalem  compromise  means  violence:  Mubarak   Lamia  Lahoud   JERUSALEM:  A  compromise  over  Jerusalem  would  lead  to  uncontrollable  violence  in  the  Middle  East,  Egyptian  President  Hosni  Mubarak  has  warned,  adding  that  no  Arab  or  Muslim  can  relinquish  rights  to  east  Jerusalem  and  its  holy  sites.   Palestinian  officials  also  warned  that  with  out  a  compromise  acceptable  to  the  majori  ty  of  Arabs,  terrorism  may  erupt  over   Jerusalem.   “Any  compromise  over  Jerusalem  will  cause  the  region  to  explode  in  a  way  that  cannot  be  put  under  control  and  terrorism  will  rise  again,”  Mubarak  said  in  his  first  public  comment  since  last  month’s  failed  Camp  David  Summit.   “No  single  person  in  the  Arab  or  Islamic  world  can  squander  east  Jerusalem  or  Al  Aksa  Mosque,”  Mubarak  told  the  Cairo  week  ly,  Rose  el-Youssef.  “In  this  context,  even  Arafat  himself  will  not  dare  to  sign  a  deal  to  give  up  these  Muslim  shrines.”   Meanwhile,  a  Palestinian  Authority  official  conceded  that  the  Palestinians  were  eager   to  reach  an  agreement  while  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  was  still  in  office.  The  official  said  that  Israeli  and  Palestinian  intellectuals  had  been  meeting  to  discuss  the  issue  at   Orient  House.   “We  are  trying  to  solve  the  issue  by  divid  ing  sovereignty  into  functions  which  can  then  be  divided  between  the  sides,”  one  Palestinian  participant  in  these  meetings  said.  He  said  the  issue  should  also  be  dis  cussed  with  religious  leaders  who  may  help  find  a  solution.   In  the  interview  with  the  Cairo  weekly,  Mubarak  stressed  that  Egypt  would  not  stop  PA  chairman  Yasser  Arafat  from  reaching  a  deal  over  the  disputed  city  “if  it’s  compati  ble  with  his  Palestinian  people’s  demands.”   Arafat’s  tour  of  the  Arab  world  and  Iran  was   a  disappointment  for  the  Palestinian  leader,   PA  officials  admitted.   Arafat  failed  to  convince  Arabs  to  hold  an   Arab  summit  or  at  least  a  meeting  of  the  Islamic  Organisation  Conference.   While  most  of  the  Arab  states  pressured  Arafat  not  to  compromise  on  Jerusalem,  no  state  was  ready  to  attend  a  summit  or  just  a   meeting  on  Jerusalem,  Palestinian  Minister  for  Parliamentary  Affairs  Nabil  Amr  said.   He  said  the  Arabs  bowed  to  US  pressure.  The  Americans,  he  said,  oppose  an  Arab  summit  since  they  fear  that  it  would  make  a  compromise  even  more  difficult.   “The  Arabs  would  have  to  state  their  max  imum  positions  on  Jerusalem  in  such  a  sum  mit  for  their  own  political  purposes,”  a  PA  official  explained.   At  last  night’s  Palestinian  cabinet  meeting  in  Ramallah,  Arafat  briefed  the  ministers  on  his  trip.  Nabil  Amr  said  the  Arabs  would  not  pressure  Arafat  and  would  also  not  be  in  his  way  when  he  decides  on  a  compromise  that  he  sees  fit  for  an  agreement  with  Israel.   Libyan  leader  Muammar  Gaddafi  told  Arafat  he  supported  his  position  on  the  peace  process,  Amr  said.  Although  Iran  received  Arafat  coolly,  Amr  said  the  Palestinian  leader  was  pleased  by  his  meet  ing  with  Iranian  President  Mohammed  Khatami.  He  said  Arafat  informed  the  Iranians  that  he  will  continue  to  pursue  the   peace  process.   Jerusalem  rost   Egyptian  President  Hosni  Mubarak. ",2000-08-18
"  NEW  YORK;  Four  of  the  13  Iranian  Jews  accused  of  spying  for  Israel  have  retracted  their  “confes  sions”,  according  to  an  American  advocate.   According  to  American  Jewish  leader  Malcolm  Hoenlein,  Shahrokh  Paknahad,  Farzad  Kashi,  Nasser  Levi  Haim  and  Farhad  Saleh  have  told  Judge  Sadeq  Nourani  that  their  “confes  sions”  had  been  made  under  duress.  In  another   development,  a  Muslim  accused  of  collaborating  with  the  Jews  denied  the  charge.   A  verdict  is  expected  this  week.  It  was  origi  nally  scheduled  for  last  week,  but  was  delayed  because  of  the  additional  hearing.  Attorney   Esmail  Nasseri  was  quoted  as  saying  that  the  court  proceedings  “were  of  benefit  to  our  clients  and  strengthen  the  defence  team’s  assertions  that  our  clients  are  not  guilty”.   Pooya  Dayanim,  a  spokesman  for  the  Council  of  Iranian  American  Jewish  Organisations  in  Los  Angeles,  said  the  Jewish  community  in  Shiraz  is  “becoming  more  confident  every  day.  Our  hope  is  that  the  other  people  who  allegedly  confessed  can  be  brought  to  court  so  they  can  recant  their  confessions  as  well.  We  should  not  be  overly  optimistic  about  these  reports,  but  these  are   certainly  positive  developments.   JTA ",2000-06-23

"  AWAY  from  the  hullabaloo  of  the  official  peace  process  in  the  Middle  East,  Hussein  Ibrahim  Issa  quietly  practised  Arab-Israeli   reconciliation  near  Bethlehem.  The  founder  and  principal  of  the  Hope  Flowers  school,  he  ensured  that  underprivileged  Palestinian  children  could  meet,  befriend,  learn  from,  and  in  turn,  educate  their  Israeli  counter  parts.   Issa,  who  died  from  a  heart  attack  at  the  age  of  52,  was  a  dynamic  man  with  an  abili  ty  to  inspire  others.  He  also  brought  numer  ous  volunteers  to  Hope  Flowers,  convened  symposiums  of  rabbis,  priests  and  imams,  ran  democracy  workshops  on  the  eve  of  the  first  Palestinian  elections,  and  attracted  vis  its  from  international  luminaries,  such  as  Hillary  Clinton.  He  even  built  an  on-site  farm  to  generate  income  and  thereby  liberate  Hope  Flowers  from  its  perennial  debts.   Issa’s  lack  of  bitterness  and  his  genius  at  forging  links  were  all  the  more  remarkable  considering  his  difficult  upbringing.  He  was  born  into  a  Muslim  family  in  Ramie,  a  town  built  by  the  8th  century  Caliph  Suleiman.  Soon  war  swept  the  land,  and  within  a  year  the  Issa  family  was  forced  to  leave  Ramie,  relocating  to  the  Deheishe  refugee  camp   where  conditions  were  severe.   It  was  an  experience  that  inspired  Issa  to  make  sure  that  Palestinian  society  should  take  care  of  the  plight  of  its  children.  Most  Palestinians  wanted  nothing  to  do  with  Israelis,  but  Issa  believed  that  only  mutual  understanding  and  self-sufficiency  could  restore  Palestinian  national  dignity.  “Peace  and  democracy  education  should  be  given  to  infants  with  their  mother’s  milk,”  he  once   wrote.   In  1984,  he  founded  a  progressive  child  care  centre  named  al-Amal  (the  Hope)  in  the  village  of  al-Khader,  west  of  Bethlehem.  It   consisted  of  one  rented  room  with  22  pupils  and  no  chairs.  Within  five  years  it  had  grown  into  a  primary  and  secondary  school  complex,  known  as  Hope  Rowers.   Issa  never  felt  constrained  by  traditions  or  borders.  He  led  mothers  and  children  on  trips  across  the  green  line  (the  old  1967  border  between  Israel  and  the  West  Baulk),  arguing  that  “Israeli  and  Palestinian  des  tinies  are  inevitably  tied.  We  have  no  choice  but  to  work  together  to  try  and  forge  a  peaceful  co-existence.”   Before  long  his  young  Muslim  and  Christian  charges  were  mixing  with  Jewish  children  at  Jerusalem’s  Waldorf  School  and  the  Democratic  School  of  Hadera.  Together  they  demolished  the  stereotypes  that  years   of  conflict  had  nurtured.   Yet,  reality  constantly  impinged  on  Issa’s  dreams.  His  students  learnt  reconciliation  in  class,  but  experienced  disruption  on  the  streets.  The  Intifada  uprising,  which  began  in  1987,  left  many  households  without  income  to  pay  school  fees.  When  public  transport  broke  down,  Issa  personally  picked  up  his  students  and  drove  them  to  school.  And  after  terror  acts  in  Israel  result  ed  in  recurrent  border  closures,  Issa  con  demned  both  the  “heinous”  policies  of  Hamas  and  Israeli  “collective  punishment”.   Hussein  Issa  was  a  tireless  campaigner,  forever  thinking  up  new  schemes.  Yet,  despite  dealing  daily  with  the  results  of  his  torical  tragedy,  he  was  invariably  sunny  and  loved  nothing  better  than  a  good  joke.  Education  meant  more  than  just  cerebral  study  to  him.  It  encompassed  all  aspects  of  life,  and  determined  one’s  attitude  to  oth   ers.   He  took  succour  from  his  devoted  family  and  his  religion.  Ultimately,  his  legacy  will  be  the  children  whose  lives  he  enriched  and  who  he  infused  “with  the  importance,  beau  ty  and  necessity  of  peace”.  He  is  survived   by  his  wife.   Lawrence  Jofffe ",2000-09-15
"  NEW  YORK:  The   c  o  n  -   tenders  in  the  US  elections  have  been   reaching   out  to  Arab  Americans  in  an  unprece  dented   a  Gore-ueDerman  Kipa.   way.  Arab  Americans  number  from   three  to  six  million.   Last  week  Texas  Governor   George  Bush  picked  up  the  support  of  the  American  Muslim  Political  Co-ordinating  Council,  after  receiv  ing  endorsement  from  20  Arab  American  organisations  in  Michigan.   While  both  Texas  Governor   George  Bush  and  Vice-President  A1  Gore  have  expressed  support  for  Israel,  they  are  concerned  that  Joe  Lieberman,  Gore’s  running  mate,  is  “an  activist  for,  and  champion  of,  the  Israeli  agenda”.   Arab  groups  were  also  pleased  that  Bush  said  the  racial  profiling  of  Arab  Americans  was  unfair,  and  he  cited  the  use  of  classified  informa  tion  about  people  suspected  of  ter  rorist  activity  who  are  detained  in  the  United  States.  He  was  sending  a  clear  message  on  national  television  to  the  Arab  American  community.   The  Gore-Lieberman  campaign’s  choice  of  Arab  American  leader  James  Zogby  as  a  new  adviser  is  another  indication  of  the  impor   tance  of  the  Arab  American  com  munity.

"  I  REFER  to  your  article  by  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Cohen  in  reviewing  the  book  Renewing  the  Covenant.  A  kabbalistic  Guide  to  Jewish  Spirituality.   He  makes  the  point  that  a  new  covenant  is  emerging.  He  compares  this  new  covenant  to  the  failed  Saul  of  Tarsus  and  the  Shabtai  Zvi  movements.  It  is  a  pity  he  didn’t  include  the  current  revisionism  of  Judaism  by  the  Reform/Liberal  movement.   Unfortunately,  the  people  in  these  movements,  even  given  the  best  of  goodwill,  are  securing  the  fact  that  in  one,  two  or  three  generations  their  descendants  won’t  be  Jewish  or  lead  ing  a  Jewish  lifestyle.   This  is  sad,  but  true.  The  pity  is  we  mostly  have  our  head  in  the  sand  and  ignore  the  reality.  I  should  know.  My  grand-daughter  just  married  a  Pakistani  in  a  Muslim  ceremony.  He  is  a  nice  boy,  but  not  what  1  would  have  hoped  for.  And  it’s  not  really  her  fault.  It’s  my  fault  for  trying  to  melt  into  the  society  which  gave  me  refuge  from  the  horrors  of  the  Holocaust.  If  I  could  do  it  all  over  again,  I  wouldn’t  take  the  easy  options  which  I  did  with  Judaism.  It  would’ve  been  harder,  but  it  would  not  have  been  so  tragic.

"  Books   Tracing  Sephardic  histoiy   Title;   Sephardi  Jewry:  A  History  of  the   Judeo  Spanish  Community,   14th-20th  Centuries   Author   Esther  Benbassa  and   Aron  Rodrigue   Publisher:  umversny  or  camorma  rress.   376  pp,  $49.95   Reviewer  Ben  Haneman   EVERY  reader  recalls  the  expulsion  of  the   Jews  from  Spain  in  1492.  Less  well  known  is  what  happened  to  those  Jews  after  they  found  sanctuary  in  the  Balkan  countries  under  Ottoman  rule.   This  well-researched  book  offers  a  complete  history  of  how  they  fared  there  for  the  next  five  centuries.  1  found  it  fascinating,  not  only  because  it  filled  me  in  on  what  happened  to  the  Jews  who  left  Spain,  but  because  it  reminded  me  that  dis  putes  in  Jewish  communities  are  endemic,  per  haps  even  “normal”.   The  confusing  variety  of  names  used  by  authors  Esther  Benbassa  and  Aron  Rodrigue  merely  reflects  facets  of  Jewish  history.  Take  the  term  Sephardim,  for  example.  Sepharad  is  Hebrew  for  Spain.  Although  all  non-Ashkenazi  Jews  are  sometimes  loosely  labelled  Sephardim,  the  genuine  Sephardim  came  from  the  Iberian  Peninsula  encompassing  Spain  and  Portugal.  They  eventually  predominated  in  the  Jewish  world  in  the  Balkans  and  Near  Middle  East  because  they  were  more  sophisticated  and  worldly-wise.   A  later  wave  of  immigration  from  Portugal  brought  many  Portuguese  Marranos  or  newly  professed  Christians,  who  secretly  continued  their  adherence  to  Jewish  belief  and  practice.  For  a  few  years,  Portugal  had  been  a  haven  for  Jews  fleeing  Spain.  But  forced  conversions  had  subsequently  been  imposed,  swelling  the  num  ber  of  Marranos.  Skilled  at  living  in  two  worlds,  they  brought  many  abilities,  as  well  as  links  and  family  connections  on  both  sides  of  the  religious  divide,  especially  to  the  business  world  of   Amsterdam  and  Ancona.   An  outstanding  example  of  the  growth  of  a  Sephardi  Jewish  community  is  Salonika,  which  came  into  Greek  possession  much  later.  It  had  been  an  enormous  Jewish  centre  with  involve  ment,  strangely,  in  wharf-labouring  and  in  the   first  Sephardi  trade  union.  Of  Salonika’s  56,000  Jews,  all  but  10,000  were  later  murdered  by  the  Germans,  most  being  gassed  on  the  day  of  their  arrival  at  the  death  camps.   The  Muslims  were  tolerant  in  their  fashion,  and  for  half-a-millennium,  the  Jews  lived  in  rela  tive  peace.  In  1840  the  Damascus  Blood  Libel  focused  world  Jewish  attention  on  Sephardi  Jews,  who  were  seen  as  backward  and  exotic.  The  case  involved  a  strange  Capuchin  monk,  who  disappeared  under  equally  strange  circum   stances,  his  Capuchin  brothers  claiming  that  he  had  been  killed  by  the  Jews  in  a  ritual  murder.  Forced  confessions  were  obtained,  people  were  unjustly  imprisoned  and  some  died  in  captivity.   This  led  to  Western  Jewry  becoming  acutely  aware  of  their  Sephardi  brethren.  French  Jewry,  in  particular,  in  keeping  with  French  imperialism,  formed  the  Alliance  Israelite  Universelle,  a  benef  icent  society  which  established  many  schools.  Interestingly,  there  were  intracommunal  lan  guage  wars  involving  at  one  time  or  another  Greek,  Hebrew,  JudeoSpanish  (Ladino),  Turkish,  Bulgarian  and  French.   Of  interest  is  pre-Herzlian  Zionism,  which  flourished,  not  always  as  a  question  of  returning  to  the  Holy  Land,  but  rather  as  a  secular  nation  alism,  often  reflecting  rebellion  by  the  young  against  their  parents’  religiosity.  Indeed,  Sephardi  Jewry  provided  many  of  the  immi  grants  to  the  State  of  Israel,  where  they  suffer  a  low  status  to  this  day,  particularly  if  they  are  Jews  from  Turkey  and  other  Muslim  countries,  their  Muslim  background  being  seen  as  yet  fur  ther  evidence  of  their  inferiority.   The  final  unravelling  of  the  Ottoman  Empire  and  its  balkanisation  explains  the  varying  fates  of  Jewry  in  those  countries.  The  Bulgarians  and  their  Church  behaved  well,  the  Croatians  badly.  The  Italians,  in  their  charming  if  inefficient  man  ner,  saved  many  Jews  in  their  occupied  territo   ries.   If  this  book  is  vaguely  familiar,  it’s  because  it  appeared  earlier  in  hard-back  form,  but  without  the  prologue  and  under  a  different  title,  Jews  of  the  Balkans:  The  Judeo-Spanish  Community  14th   to  20th  Centuries.

"  BBIGSadstoaie   TORONTO:  Canada's  Jewish  community  has  experienced  a  spate  of  antisemitic  violence  that  some  observers  say  is  “the  worst  concentrated  outbreak  of  antisemitism,  particularly  against  religious  institutions,  since  the  Second  World  War”   That  was  the  assessment  of  Manuel  Prutschi,  national  director  of  community  relations  for  the  Canadian  Jewish  Congress  (CJC).   The  CJC  has  logged  50  incidents  of  arson,  assault,  graffiti  and  vandalism  against  Jewish  targets  since  Israeli-Palestinian  tensions  increased  in  the  Middle  East  in  late  September.   Two  students  wearing  kipotwere  beaten  up  in  a  subway,  another  was  bullied  in  a  schoolyard  and  a  man  was  beaten  as  he  walked  home  from  synagogue.  Bricks  have  shattered  windows  of  two  synagogues,  and  antisemitic  or  pro  Palestinian  graffiti  have  been  spraypainted  on  five  synagogues.  Jewish  shops  and  institutions  have  likewise  been  targeted.  The  five  incidents  of  arson  include  the  firebombing  of  synagogues   Canada  s  vote  in  favour  of  a  UN  resolution  critical  of  Israel  has  created  a   climate  of  antisemitism  in  the  country   and  the  headquarters  of  a  Jewish  burial  society.   Yousef  Sandouga,  20,  was  charged  with  arson  after  a  Molotov  cocktail  thrown  at  a  synagogue  caused  $1000  in  damage.   In  one  incident,  police  responding  to  a  bomb  threat  searched  a  community  centre  on  Yom  Kippur  without  disrupting  services.  The  Israeli  Embassy  also  received  a  bomb  threat,  and  Jewish  officials  have  received  death  threats.   Congregations  and  Jewish  institutions  across  Canada  have  increased  security  precautions,  and  many  have  hired  full-time  security  staff.   The  Montreal  Urban  Community  Police  has  taken  to  patrolling  outside  synagogues  every  hour,  said  Robert  Libman,  Mayor  of  Cote  Saint  Luc—a  Montreal  area  with  a  high  proportion  of   Jewish  residents.   “No  community  should  have  to  endure  what  the  Jewish  community  has  had  to  endure,”  Prutschi  said.  “The  political,  religious  and  ethnic  leaders  all  have  a  responsibility,  repeatedly  and   publicly,  to  condemn  and  repudiate  such  acts,  not  only  because  they  threaten  the  Jewish  com  munity,  but  because  they  are  an  assault  on  the  multicultural  fabric  of  Canada.”   The  Canadian  Jewish  Congress  was  quick  to  condemn  graffiti  on  Palestine  House,  headquar  ters  of  the  Canadian  Palestinian  community,  out  side  Toronto.  “We  were  appalled  by  this  attack,  and  we  issued  a  statement  condemning  it  as  rep  rehensible,”  said  Prutschi,  who  said  the  local  Arab  community  does  not  repudiate  specific  acts  of  violence  against  Jewish  targets  in  Canada.   Several  rabbis  and  a  lone  Muslim  imam  in  Ottawa  issued  a  joint  statement,  urging  that  rela  tions  between  the  Jewish  and  Arab  communities  in  Canada  should  not  be  affected  by  the  conflict  in  the  Middle  East  “The  fact  that  you  have  six  rabbis  to  one  Muslim  religious  leader  signing  that  tends  to  imply  that  the  Jews  are  primarily  on  the  giving  end,  rather  than  on  the  receiving  end  of  such  initiatives,”  Prutschi  said.   The  National  Post  asserted  that  Canada’s  vote  in  favour  of  a  UN  resolution  critical  of  Israel  has  created  a  climate  of  antisemitism  in  the  country.   Although  the  government’s  vote  was  seen  to  draw  away  Jewish  votes  from  the  ruling  Liberal  Party  in  advance  of  this  week’s  election,  Prutschi  said  it  had  not  sparked  antisemitic  activity.  “The  UN  vote  was  not  helpful  in  terms  of  the  overall  atmosphere,  but  it  is  one  of  many  elements  behind  the  wave  of  anti-Jewish  violence,”  he  said.   Some  participants  in  anti-Israel  demonstra  tions  have  called  for  “Death  to  the  Jews”,  he  noted,  and  have  carried  placards  signs  equating  the  Star  of  David  with  the  swastika,  and  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  with  Adolf  Hitler.   Some  parts  of  the  Arab  world  have  called  for  a  jihad,  or  holy  war,  against  Israel  and  the  Jews,  Prutschi  observed,  adding  that  such  statements  have  helped  to  incite  attacks  on  Canadian  Jews.   The  number  of  antisemitic  incidents  in  Canada  for  the  month  of  October  has  doubled  over  the  same  period  last  year,  according  to  B’nai  Brith  Canada’s  League  for  Human  Rights.

"  women   IN  the  light  of  the  statement  in  Rochelle  Furstenberg’s  article  “Still  fighting  for  equality”  (AJN  11/2/00)  stating  that  “inequalities  scream  out  for  redress”,  we  feel  readers  should  know  that  Wizo  is  at  the  forefront  of  efforts  to  obtain  that  redress.   Our  most  recent  initiative  is  the  establishment  of  a  school  in  Israel  to  train  potential  political  candidates,  because  it  is  evident  that  increasing  the  influence  of  women  at  all  levels  of  the  political  system  will  lead  to  an  increased  focus  on  the  many  issues  relating  to  the  poor  status  of  women  in  Israeli  society.   The  school  in  Jerusalem  (with  two  more  planned  for  Haifa  and  the  Negev)  has  45  students  chosen  from  150  candi  dates,  including  the  daughter  of  a  Shas  rabbi,  an  American  journalist  and  a  Muslim  woman.  The  year-long  course  will  include  training  in  political  and  leadership  skills,  communication,  women’s  issues  and  strategy  develop  ment  —  training  which  will  equip  grad  uates  to  enter  political  life  at  all  levels  from  local  government  right  up  to  the   Knesset.   This  initiative  is  typical  of  Wizo’s  many-faceted  approach  to  tackling  the  problems  which  beset  women  in  Israel,  from  unequal  employment  opportuni  ties  and  wages  to  domestic  violence  and  the  agunot.

"  Sichat  Yosef   SO,  the  Pope  has  been  and  gone,  and  there  is  an   atmosphere  of  reconciliation  in  the  air.  He  didn’t  formally  apologise  for  the  silence  of  his  wartime  predecessor,  but  he  certainly  went  further  than  any  other  Pope  in  history  in  moving  towards  an  understanding.  In  so  doing  he  continued  with  a  process  that  has  been  in  train  since  his  election  to  high   office.   For  one  committed  to  the  religion  he  represents,  there  must  have  been  many  high  points  to  his  pilgrimage.  However  for  us  as  Jews  —  whether  or  not  we  are  citizens  of  Israel  —  the  high  point  off  his  tour  was  the  sight  of  the  unprecedented  visit  by  a  head  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  to  the  Kotel  itself.  There  he  followed  ancient  Jewish  tradition  by  lodging  in  the  crack  of  the  wall,  a  note  signed  with  his  trembling  hand  saying;   “God  of  our  fathers,  you  chose  Abraham  and  his  descendants  to  bring  your  Name  to  the  Nations.  We  are  deeply  saddened  by  the  behaviour  of  those  who  in  the  course  of  history  have  caused  these  children  off  yours  to  suffer,  and  asking  your  forgiveness  we  wish  to  commit  ourselves  to  genuine  brotherhood  with  the  people  of  the  Covenant.”  In  the  words  of  Israel’s  Minister  for  the  Diaspora,  Rabbi  Michael  Melchior,  “He  touched  the  Wall  and  was  touched  by  the  Wall.”   Whilst  the  striking  image  of  the  Pope  deep  in  thought  at  the  Wall  does  not  of  itself  wipe  out  the  pain  of  those  of  our  forebears  forced  to  bend  their  knees  at  images  sacred  to  Christianity  yet  simultaneously  anathema  to  Judaism,  one  cannot  but  feel  a  need  to  say  to  him:  Kol  Hakavod.  This  is  particularly  the  case  when  we  ponder  on  the  extent  to  which  in  Christian  theology  the  destruction  of  the  Temple,  of  which  the  Kotel  serves  as  the  last  obvious  remnant,  was  often  used  as  a  justification  for  the  new  theology  of  Christianity  as  being  the  rightful  successor  to  the  Judaism  it  saw  as  superceded.  Indeed  the  Pope’s  theologically  daring  commitment  to  brotherhood  and  equality  heralds  a  new  era.   That  being  so  it  was  doubly  unfortunate  —  though  perhaps  not  surprising  —  that  the  mission  of  peace  and  brotherhood  was  marred  by  the  comments  of  the  Mufti  off  Jerusalem.   Following  the  Pope’s  visit  to  Yad  Vashem,  Jerusalem’s  top  Muslim  cleric  could  not  restrain  himself  from  claiming  that  the  Holocaust  had  been  exaggerated  by  Israel  to  gain  international  support.  “It’s  true,  the  number  was  less  than  six  million  and  Israel  is  using  the  issue  to  get  sympathy  woldwide,”  Sheik  Sabri  said.  As  pointed  out  by  Ross  Dunn  in  his  report  for  The  Age,  he  appeared  to  be  trying  to  undermine  the  impact  of  the  Pope’s  impassioned  pleas  last  week  for  the  world  never  to  forget  the  victims  of  the  Holocaust  and  to  ensure  such  a  tragedy  never  happens  again.   The  reality  is  that  there  is  a  double  irony  in  the  Mufti’s  words.  Had  he  had  more  political  sense,  he  might  have  concentrated  on  the  reality  that  while  prior  to  the  advent  of  political  Zionism  Jews  in  Muslim  teritory  were  often  treated  as  second  class  citizens,  there  was  never  the  enmity  which  was  a  feature  of  millennia  of  Jewish  life  in  the  Christian  —  especially  Catholic  —  Diaspora  lands.  To  that  extent,  there  was  less  historical  need  for  a  reconciliation  between  Judaism  and  Islam.  And  on  the  other  hand  he  should  have  been  well  aware  of  the  extent  to  which  one  of  his  predecessors,  Hajj  Amin  al  Husseini,  the  Mufti  of  Jerusalem  during  World  War  II,  collaborated  with  Nazi  Germany:  he  met  with  Hitler  to  discuss  their  common  interests;  participated  in  the  anti-British  and  pro-German  Iraqi  coup  of  1941;  spread  its  propaganda  in  the  Arab  world;  and  showed  his  close  affiliation  to  the  Nazis  by  becoming  one  of  the   earliest  sources  of  information  from  the  Axis  side  as  to  the  number  of  Jews  who  had  been  murdered.   We  welcome  the  change  of  heart  of  Catholicism  presaged  by  recent  events.  But  sadly,  as  we  will  shortly  say  in  the  Haggadah:  bechol  dor  vador  omdim  alenu  lechatotenu  —  in  every  generation  there  are  those  who  stand  up  to  annihilate  us.

"  Stefai  BialogusSd   A  LECTURER  in  Middle  East  history  at  the  University  of  New  South  Wales  has  defended  the  appearance  on  his  office  door  of  a  pamphlet  equating  Israel  with  Nazi  Germany.   Produced  by  a  shadowy  group  called  Every  Action,  the  leaflet  claims  that  Israel,  like  Nazi  Germany,  engaged  in  “organised  slaughter  of  innocent  civilians”  by  the  military,  as  well  as  in  “numerous  acts  of  war  crimes”.   Associate  Professor  of  History  Ian  Bickerton  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  the  leaflet  was  one  of  many  expressing  a  range  of  opinions  which  were  posted  on  his  door.   “I  see  it  as  an  expression  of  a  point  of  view  by  students,  which  is  entirely  appropriate  for  them  to  do  within  the  academic,  intellectual,  institu  tional  environment  of  the  university,”  he  said.  “It  doesn’t  go  outside  that  environment,  nor  should   it.   “It’s  none  of  the  Jewish  News’  business  what  students  are  doing  in  the  university,  in  that  stu  dents  are  free  to  express  any  view  they  like.  Any  suggestion  that  they  should  not  is  totally  inap  propriate.   “But  I’m  not  identifying  with,  or  supporting,  the  views  in  the  pamphlet.  I  was  in  no  way  involved  in  that  pamphlet,  nor  do  I  agree  with  it.”   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  nation  al  vice-president  Jeremy  Jones  said:  “If  someone  believes  that  it’s  in  the  bounds  of  reasonable  expression  to  make  an  analogy  between  Israel  and  Nazi  Germany,  it  shows  not  only  extraordi  nary  lack  of  judgment,  but  an  insensitivity  to  the  basics  of  history.”   A  specialist  in  American  relations  with  Israel,  Professor  Bickerton  said  the  factual  accuracy  of  the  pamphlet’s  claims  were  not  the  issue.  “If  I  saw  my  role  as  the  guard  at  the  gate  of  factual  truth  or  error,  I  would  be  insane  and  my  job  would  be  never-ending.  There’s  no  such  thing  as  agreement  on  what  is  factually  correct  on  every  single  issue,  nor  is  that  a  criterion  as  to  whether   a  document  should  be  on  a  wall  or  not.”   Regarding  the  pamphlet’s  insinuation  that  Israel  undertook  the  “organised  slaughter  of  innocent  civilians  by  military”,  Professor  Bickerton  said:  “It’s  not  clearly  baseless  at  all.  It’s   The  leaflet  which  was  placed  on  Professor  Ian  Bickerton’s  door  at  the  University  of  NSW.   an  opinion.  It’s  clearly  contentious,  its  clearly  argumentative,  it’s  clearly  designed  to  encour  age  people  to  believe  a  particular  perspective  on  events  that  are  occurring.  You  are  as  locked  into  the  views  that  you  hold  as  the  people  who  wrote  that  pamphlet.  University  is  a  place  of  unlocking  people’s  minds,  not  locking  them  in.”   Approximately  100  Jewish  students  attended  a  meeting  at  the  university  last  week  to  express  solidarity  with  Israel.  At  the  meeting,  Mr  Jones  described  factual  errors  and  examples  of  anti  Israel  bias  in  the  media’s  reporting  of  the  recent  violence.  He  urged  students  to  utilise  their  free  time  to  alert  news  organisations  to  anything  they  hear  which  they  believe  to  be  wrong,  rather  than  just  to  complain  among  themselves.   “When  you  read  what  appears  in  the  letters  pages  and  op-ed  pages,  you  can  see  how  you   Students  at  the  rally  at  the  University  of  NSW.

As  students,  you  have  lots  of  free  time.  Think  of  using  some  of  that  free  time  towards  advocating  something  in  which  you   believe.”   Students  told  the  AJN  that  the  meeting  had  boosted  their  morale,  some  acknowledging  that  they  felt  they  had  to  “keep  their  heads  down”  because  of  the  way  in  which  the  crisis  was  being  portrayed  in  the  media.   Hillel  director  David  Bryfman  urged  the  stu  dents  to  put  their  sense  of  morality  into  practice.   “We  as  young  Jewish  students  have  the  right  and  obligation  to  condemn  the  actions  of  indi  viduals  who  overstep  the  boundaries  or  morali  ty  and  Jewish  ethics.  I  don’t  care  if  those  people   are  Muslim,  Jewish  or  anytning  else,  we  need  to   maintain  our  own  dignity  in  that  regard.  Anyone  who  feels  this  situation  can  be  solved  in  any  way  other  than  by  sitting  down  and  talking  has  a  dis  turbed  sense  of  reality.”   Shalom  Institute  chief  executive  Dr  Hilton  Immerman  told  the  AJN  that  students  were  con  cerned  by  the  “virulent  anti-israel  and  anti  Jewish  propaganda  that’s  been  put  up  at  some  campuses.  They  feel  worried  at  the  fact  that  there  have  been  a  number  of  attacks  in  the  com  munity  at  large.  But  there  is  greater  concern  at  Sydney  University  because  the  number  of  Jewish  students  there  is  much  lower  and  the  radical  Muslim  groups  are  stronger.”   H  Make  your  voices  heard)  rally  toM,   page  40 ",2000-10-27
"  ANALYSIS   David  Landau   JERUSALEM:  Belatedly  —  perhaps  too  late  —  Arab  leaders  have  joined  the  United  States  and  others  in  efforts  to  salvage  an  Israeli-Palestinian  peace  deal.   Jordan’s  King  Abdullah  visited  the  Palestinian  Authority  and  Israel  last  week.  Egypt’s  President  Hosni  Mubarak  met  with  the  leader  of  Israel’s  Meretz  Party,  Yossi  Sarid,  and  Israel’s  Acting  Foreign  Minister,  Shlomo  Ben-Ami,  also  last   week.   Jordan,  and  even  more  so  Egypt,  were  markedly  slow  to  respond  earlier  in  the  (north  ern)  summer,  when  US  President  Bill  Clinton  sought  their  active  involvement,  together  with  that  of  Saudi  Arabia,  in  his  effort  at  Camp  David  to  coax  Palestinian  Authority  President  Yasser  Arafat  towards  greater  flexibility.  Indeed,  Mubarak’s  cold-shoulder  approach  toward  the   If  the  King  of  Jordan  can  line  up  a  significant  body  of  Arab  and   Muslim  opinion  behind  a  solution  for  Jerusalem,  that  may  snatch  success   from  the  jaws  of  failure.   US  President  led  to  a  period  of  tense  relations  between  Washington  and  Cairo.   After  Camp  David  ended  in  failure  in  July,  Egyptian  leaders  declared  repeatedly  that  they  would  not  twist  Arafat’s  arm  at  Washington’s  behest.  They  praised  the  Palestinian  leader’s  resilience  in  withstanding  American  pressures.  In  Mubarak’s  frequent  meetings  with  Arafat,  there  was  no  indication  —  at  least  publicly  —  that  Egypt  was  seeking  to  impress  upon  him  the  need  for  new  flexibility,  particularly  over  Jerusalem,  to  prevent  the  final  collapse  of  the  peace  effort  and  the  inevitable  defeat  of  the  Barak  government  in  Israel.   It  was  all  the  more  significant,  therefore,  to  hear  the  usually  hardline  Egyptian  Foreign  Minister,  Amre  Moussa,  tell  reporters  that  he  and  other  diplomats  were  looking  at  new  ideas  concerning  Jerusalem.   Analysts  note  the  link  between  these  new  Arab  initiatives  and  Arafat’s  failure  to  gain  inter  national  support  for  a  unilateral  declaration  of  Palestinian  statehood.  During  intense  globetrot  ting  in  recent  weeks,  Arafat  heard  repeatedly  from  world  leaders  —  including  the  usually  Palestinian-friendly  leaders  in  France  and  China  —  to  go  back  and  work  out  a  deal  with  Israel.   The  new  ideas,  say  knowledgeable  sources  in  Israel,  may  now  be  coming  from  Jordan’s   Abdullah.  While  obviously  far  less  influential  than  Egypt  in  inter-Arab  politics,  the  Jordanian  King  has  longstanding  ties  with  the  disputed  Holy  City.  These  were  given  formal  recognition  in  the  1994  peace  treaty  between  Israel  and  Jordan.   Abdullah,  moreover,  does  not  hide  his  eager  ness  to  see  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  finally  resolved  —  and  his  own  country  awarded,  he  hopes,  generous  compensation  from  the  inter  national  community  for  its  part  in  the  absorp  tion  of  large  numbers  of  Palestinian  refugees.  He  is  anxious,  too,  to  ensure  that  the  security  arrangements  that  Israel  puts  in  place  in  the  Jordan  Valley,  in  the  context  of  a  peace  settle  ment  with  the  Palestinians,  serve  to  protect  his  country,  too,  from  any  hostile  Palestinian  expan   sionism  eastward.   Israeli  sources  say  Abdullah  is  proposing  to  Arafat  and  Barak  that  they  agree  to  set  aside  part  of  the  Jerusalem  problem  while  agreeing  on  all  the  other  aspects  of  the  conflict.  The  remaining  areas  of  disagreement  would  embrace  the   Temple  Mount  and  parts  of  the  walled  Old  City.   The  idea  to  exclude  Jerusalem  from  a  final  deal  has  not  gone  anywhere  before.   Barak’s  problem,  politically,  is  that  he  needs  to  submit  to  the  Israeli  public,  whether  in  a  plebiscite  or  in  elections,  a  deal  that  carries  the  headline  “End  of  the  Conflict”.   Abdullah,  with  the  Americans,  the  Europeans  and  anyone  else  involved  in  this  initiative  will  need  to  find  wording  that  can  register  the  end  of  the  conflict  while  leaving  sovereignty  over  the  holy  sites  unresolved.   The  diplomatic  wires  are  currently  full  of  for  mulas  —  from  politicians,  academics,  historians  and  assorted  dreamers  —  regarding  how  sover  eignty  can  be  vested  in  the  three  faiths,  in  God,  in  the  two  neighbouring  states,  in  other  nebu  lous  bodies,  and  how  it  can  be  shared,  layered,  parsed  and  otherwise  inventively  sidestepped.   If  the  King  of  Jordan  can  line  up  a  significant  body  of  Arab  and  Muslim  opinion  behind  a  solu  tion  for  Jerusalem  that  is  acceptable  although  less-than-perfect,  that  may  prove  a  crucial  con   tribution  at  the  last  minute  that  can  snatch  suc   cess  for  Barak  and  Arafat  from  the  jaws  of  failure.   “I  am  confident  in  the  sincerity  of  President  Arafat,”  Abdullah  told  his  hosts  in  Tel  Aviv.   Barak  made  it  clear  that  he  sees  no  evidence   upon  which  to  base  such  confidence.

"  More  Blood  on  Indonesian  bands   For  years  citizens  in  Aceh  have  suffered  human  rights  abuses.  In  2000  Amnesty  International  steps  up  its  campaign  to  bring  them  to  an  end.  Last  year  students  at  UNSW  and  people  across  Australia  opened  their  eyes  to  the  human  rights  violations  in  East  Timor  and  became  vocal  opponents  to  it.  Yet  most  of  us  know  little  of  the  human  rights  violations  that  take  place  elsewhere  in  Indonesia.  Aceh  is  a  predominantly  Muslim  province  located  in  Northern  Sumatra.  Its  citizens  have  been  caught  up  for  many  years  in  the  violence  resulting  from  clashes  between  Indonesian  security  forces  and  the  armed  opposition  group,  Free  Aceh  Movement  [Gerakan  Aceh  Merdeka],  Between  1989  and  1998  Aceh  was  a  designated  Area  of  Military  Operation  [Daerah  •perasi  Militer]  and  the  subject  of  the  military's  widespread  counter-insurgency  operations.  During  this  period  large  scale  human  rights  violations  were  committed  by  security  forces.  These  included  extrajudicial  executions,  ""disappearances"",  torture  and  rape,  imprisonment  of  peaceful  activists  and  unfair  political  trials.  From  1989  to  1993,  2000  civilians  were  unlawfully  killed,  at  least  1000  arbitrarily  arrested  and  many  held  incommunicado  for  periods  of  more  than  one  year.  After  the  Area  of  Military  Operation  status  was  lifted  in  1998,  resentment  remained.   Calls  for  independence  increased  as  authorities  failed  to  bring  security  personnel  to  justice  for  human  rights  violations  committed  during  the  period.  And,  there  has  been  no  cessation  to  the  violations.  Indonesian  Legal  Aid  Institute  (Lembaga  Bantuan  Hukum]  records  show  that  in  January  this  year  over  100  people  were  tortured,  21  people  unlawfully  killed,  and  over  400  homes,  shops  and  stalls  were  burnt  down.  Unconfirmed  reports  claim  that  200  people  have  been  killed  in  Aceh  since  the  start  of  the  year.  More  recently,  attacks  appear  to  be  focussed  on  human  rights  defenders  lawyers,  humanitarian   workers,  student  activists  and  journalists.  Nashiruddin  Daud  was  a  politician  known  for  his  campaigning  for  the  prosecution  of  members  of  the  Indonesian  National  Army  [Tentara  Nasional  Indonesia]  who  were  accused  of  human  rights  violations.  He  was  found  dead  on  25  January  2000.  While  the  circumstances  of  his  death  are  unclear,  it  is  thought  that  his  murder  may  be  connected  to  his  campaigns.  In  December  last  year,  three  students  travelling  home  from  a  meeting  of  the  Congress  of  Muslim  Students  were  shot  at  by  members  of  the  Indonesian  National  Army.  They  allegedly  failed  to  stop  at  a  roadblock.  All  three  were  taken  to  hospital  after  the  incident  and  treated  for  serious  gunshot  wounds.  One  student  was  reported  to  have  both  arms  broken.  The  Free  Aceh  Movement  has  also  allegedly  committed  human  rights  abuses,  although  independent  confirmation  of  the  allegations  has  not  always  been  possible  to  obtain.  The  armed  opposition  group  stands  accused  of  murdering  members  of  security  forces  and  civilians  suspected  of  assisting  the  Indonesian  National  Army.  A  recent  article  in  New  Internationalist  suggested  that  locals  were  manipulated  into  fleeing  to  refugee  camps  so  as  to  strengthen  the  humanitarian  plea  for  independence.  Abdurrahman  Wahid's  new  Indonesian  Government  says  that  it  wants  to  improve  the  human  rights  situation  in  Aceh.  One  of  Wahid's  first  acts  in  office  was  to  appoint  Acehnese  human  rights  advocate  Hasballah  Saad  as  Indonesia's  first  Minister  for  Human  Rights.  More  recently  the  State  Secretary,  Bondan  Gunawan,  met  with  the  military  commander  of  the  Free  Aceh  Movement,  Abdullah  Syafei,  and  agreed  to  try  and  spare   civilians  from  the  conflict  between  soldiers  and  rebels.  However,  whether  this  current  agreement  will  result  in  better  conditions  in  Aceh  is  uncertain.  The  past  has  shown  us  that  despite  Wahid's  promises  in  1999,  human  rights  violations  in  Aceh  have  continued  at  an  alarming  rate.  And,  at  present,  there  are  murmers  that  Syafei  lacks  the  authority  to  make  such  an  agreement  on  behalf  of  the  Freedom  Aceh  Movement.  Amnesty  International  opposes  human  rights  violations  and  will  campaign  against  them  in  Aceh  for  as  long  as  they  continue.  Amnesty  urges  the  Indonesian  authorities  to  ensure  that  human  rights  defenders  can  carry  out  their  work  free  from  fear  of  harassment,  intimidation,  arrest,  ""disappearance"",  or  death;  to  carry  out  full  investigations  into  such  violations;  to  ensure  those  responsible  for  past  violations  are  brought  to  justice  before  a  civilian  court  according  to  international  human  rights  standards;  to  issue  immediate  instructions  to  security  forces  to  halt  arbitrary  arrests  and  detentions,  torture  and  ill-treatment,  ""disappearances""  and  unlawful  killings;  and  to  ensure  that  all  security  operations  in  Aceh  are  carried  out  in  line  with  international  human  rights  standards.  If  you  would  like  to  get  involved  in  Amnesty  International  UNSW  Group's  campaign  against  human  rights  violations  in  Aceh,  or  in  campaigns  against  human  rights  violations  elsewhere,  please  come  to  our  weekly  meetings  every  Tuesday  from  1  2pm  in  Morven  Brown  LG2.

"  Downer  calls  for  clemency  for  Iranian  Jews   Bernard  Freeitai   FOREIGN  Minister  Alexander  Downer  has  called  for  clemency  for  the  10  Iranian  Jews  imprisoned  on  charges  of  espionage.   Reacting  to  the  slight  reduction  of  sentences  (see  page  4),  he  said  he  was  disappointed  that  the  sentences  had  not  been  overturned  on  appeal,  but  saw  the  reductions  by  the  Iranian  Appeal  Court  as  “a  step  in  the  right  direction”.   He  said  the  reduced  sentences  were  in  keep  ing  with  assurances  he  had  received  from  Iranian  officials  last  July  that  the  legal  appeals   would  receive  careful  consideration  under   Iranian  law  and  that  mercy  would  be  shown.   “At  the  same  time,  I  am  disappointed  that   prison  sentences  remain  in  place,  for  both  the   Jewish  and  Muslim  detainees  and  were  not  over  turned,”  Mr  Downer  said.  “I  call  upon  the  Iranian  authorities  to  extend  clemency  to  each  of  the  10  Jews  and  two  Muslims.”   But  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  executive  director  Dr  Colin  Rubenstein  said  the  latest  verdict  demonstrated  conclusively  that  Teheran  was  not  amenable  to  quiet,  behind-the  scenes  diplomacy.  He  said  Australia  was  to  be  commended  for  its  repeated  protests,  but  “must  now  review  its  diplomatic  and  commercial  rela  tionships  with  Teheran  to  maximise  ongoing  pressure  until  such  time  as  these  innocent  per  sons  are  set  free”.   Their  sentences  had  been  produced  by  an   outrageous  legal  process  and  had  been  reduced  only  marginally  to  be  served  concurrently,  rather  than  consecutively.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  presi  dent  Nina  Bassat  described  the  Appeal  Court  decision  as  “deplorable”,  saying  Australian  Jews,  with  Jews  worldwide,  would  continue  political  action  on  behalf  of  the  Jews  of  Iran.   “The  decision  is  proof,  yet  again,  of  the  absence  of  justice  in  Iran,  notwithstanding  state  ments  by  Iranian  politicians  that  Iran  is  commit  ted  to  the  rule  of  law,”  she  said.  “The  flagrant  flouting  of  all  principles  of  human  rights  puts  a  lie  to  any  claims  by  Iran  that  it  is  seeking  to  become  a  responsible  member  of  the  interna  tional  community.” ",2000-09-29
"  IT  is  “not  acceptable  that  the  flags  of  friend  ly  countries  such  as  the  United  States  and  Israel  be  burnt”,  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  said  this  week,  in  reaction  to  the  burning  of  flags  by  Palestinian  demonstra  tors  in  the  streets  of  Sydney.   “I  ask  everybody  in  this  difficult  issue  to  exercise  their  democratic  right  of  protest,”  Mr  Howard  said.  “But  we  live  in  a  very  diverse  strong  democracy  and  in  the  end  we  are  Australians  together  before  anything   else.”   Responded  protest  organiser  and  spokesman  for  the  Sydney  Palestinian  com  munity  Sari  Kassis:  “It  is  very  unfortunate  that  Mr  Howard  considers  Israel  friendly.  We’re  burning  flags,  the  Israelis  are  burning  villages.  For  our  Prime  Minister  in  Australia  to  call  the  burning  of  a  flag  unacceptable  means  his  priorities  are  a  bit  mixed  up.”   For  the  second  consecutive  Sunday,  Palestinians  took  to  the  streets  of  Sydney  to  protest  at  Israeli  actions  in  the  current  vio  lence  in  Israel.  Police  prevented  angry  Palestinian  demonstrators  from  storming  the  US  Consulate  last  Sunday.  They  marched  to  the  Israeli  Consulate  the  previous  week.   The  latest  protest  started  at  Hyde  Park,  where  about  2000  demonstrators  were  addressed  by  Moslem  community  and  reli  gious  leaders  —  one  leader  welcoming  them  for  helping  “our  protest  against  the  Israeli  murderers  and  the  Israeli  criminals  inside  Palestine”  —  before  heading  towards  the  US  Consulate.   Demanding  an  end  to  what  they  stated  was  Israeli  violence  against  Palestinian  civil  ians,  screaming  protesters  burned  a  poster  of  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  and  the  US  and  Israeli  flags,  despite  appeals  by  com   munity  leaders  to  refrain  from  such  behav  iour  to  avoid  providing  negative  images  to  the  media.   Two  children,  possibly  as  young  as  five,  took  part  in  the  protest  dressed  in  military  outfits,  while  angry  chants  interrupted  the  five  minutes’  silence  for  the  more  than  100  Palestinians  estimated  to  have  been  killed  in  the  conflict.   The  demonstration  followed  a  Muslim  rally  outside  the  Israeli  Consulate  the  previ  ous  week,  when  more  than  1000  people  chanted  and  screamed,  waved  Palestinian,  Lebanese  and  Syrian  flags,  and  burned  an  Israeli  flag.   There  have  been  several  Palestinian  demonstrations  throughout  Australia  —  in  Sydney,  Melbourne  and  Canberra  —  since  the  eruption  of  violence  in  Israel  and  the  ter  ritories  three  weeks  ago.

"  Hostile  leaflet   DM  response  to  “Hostile  leaflet  It’s  free  speech,  says  professor”  (AW27/10/00):   I  am  disappointed  that  the  AJN  chose  to  highlight  my  remarks  concerning  the  appearance  of  an  offensive  leaflet  on  my  office  door.  I  had  hoped  that  my   sharp  comments  to  an  assertive  and  insistent  reporter  might  discourage  the  paper  from  giving  prominence  to  a  leaflet  that  was  undoubtedly  the  act  of  highly  emotional  students.   The  tragic  violence  between  Israelis  and  Palestinians  has  produced  distress  and  turmoil  in  both  communities  in  Australia  as  well.  Given  this  highly  emo  tional  state  of  affairs,  I  thought  readers  might  find  the  following  contextual  account  of  this  incident  interesting.   In  my  class  on  the  History  of  the  Arab-Israeli  Conflict,  I  have  Jewish,  Muslim  and  Christian  students  from  a  diverse  range  of  backgrounds  including  some  who  were  bom  —  or  whose  par  ents  were  born  —  in  Israel,  the  Palestinian  territories,  Lebanon,  Serbia,  Chile  and  the  US,  as  well  as  in  Australia.  I  have  never  seen  such  passion  and  heat  generated  in  class  discussion  as  in  the  past  month.  It  has  been  disturbing  to  see  the  divisions  and  the  stereotyp  ing  of  “the  other”  engaged  in  by  sup  porters  of  both  sides.  And  it  has  been  a  challenge  to  me  as  a  university  teacher.   When  I  learned  of  the  leaflet,  I  took  the  opportunity  to  use  it  as  a  teaching  device  to  counter  the  passion  and  unreasoning  descent  into  vitriol.  My  classes  spent  an  hour  or  more  dis  cussing  the  shortcomings  of  such  a  document,  and  the  offence  it  causes.  We  also  discussed  the  depth  of  feeling  that  might  lead  to,  but  not  justify,  such  a  leaflet,  with  its  offensive  distortions  and  inaccuracies.  The  episode  was  an  illustration  of  what  Thomas  Jefferson   called  “the  safety  with  which  error  of  opinion  may  be  tolerated  where  reason  is  left  free  to  combat  it”.   We  in  Australia  are  best  served  by  endeavouring  to  find  common  ground,  rather  than  fragmenting  into  mutually  hostile  enclaves.  I  see  an  important  part  of  my  role  as  assisting  students  to  understand  each  others’  points  of  view.  I  encourage  students  to  open  their  minds;  to  listen  to  the  pain  and  anger  of  others,  as  well  as  to  express  their  own.  I  do  not  believe  this  process  is  helped  by  sensationalist  headlines.   Ian  J.  Bickerton   Associate  Professor  of  History  University  of  NSW ",2000-11-03
"  AMNON  BEACH,  Israel:  When  Sa’ad  Hawa,  a  for  mer  fighter  in  the  Israel-allied  South  Lebanon  Army,  was  shot  during  a  1987  battle  while  fight  ing  alongside  Israeli  soldiers,  he  never  dreamed  that  he  and  his  comrades  would  end  up  in  a  makeshift  transit  camp  on  the  shores  of  the  Sea   of  Galilee.   But  last  week,  Hawa  joined  the  mounting  num  ber  of  confused  and  dejected  SLA  fighters  and  other  Lebanese  villagers  who  fled  their  homes,  fearing  for  their  lives  after  Hezbollah  forces  secured  control  of  Southern  Lebanon.  After  seek   ing  asylum  in  Israel,  these  refugees  are  now  try  ing  to  sort  out  their  lives  and  understand  what  has  happened.   Some  of  the  thousands  of  refugees  were  angry  at  Israel  for  failing  to  secure  conditions  for  an  orderly  withdrawal  that  would  have  allowed  them  to  take  their  belongings  with  them.  Others  said  events  had  simply  unfolded  too  fast.   “The  situation  was  just  out  of  control,”  a  red  eyed  Hawa  said,  his  lip  trembling  as  he  pondered  the  chaos  of  the  past  few  days.  “We  did  not  bring  anything  except  for  the  clothes  on  our  backs.  I  don’t  think  we  will  be  going  back  soon.”   Outside  Amnon  Beach  —  a  run-down  resort  now  functioning  as  a  transit  camp—a  convoy  of  20  tourist  buses  prepared  to  take  SLA  members  and  their  families  to  various  hotels  and  kibbut  zim  throughout  Israel.  Exhausted  women  and  children  peered  out  of  the  windows,  others  asleep.  These  are  the  newest  refugees  of  the   Middle  East.   “We  served  them,  walked  with  them  and  fought  with  them  and  they  just  dropped  us  like  dogs.  Why  should  I   come  here?”   Meanwhile,  unkempt  SLA  fighters  who  belonged  to  the  80th  Battalion  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  former  security  zone  milled  about,  looking  confused  and  dejected.  Many  were  afraid  to  pro  vide  their  names,  fearing  reprisals  against  family  members  who  stayed  behind.  Some  still  wore  the  olive-green  uniforms  bearing  the  Hebrew  insignia  of  the  Israel  Defence  Force.   Although  some  dream  of  the  day  that  they  might  be  allowed  to  return  to  their  homes,  they  are  not  holding  their  breaths.  For  now,  the  alter  natives  are  to  stay  in  Israel  or  move  to  the  United  States  or  Europe,  where  perhaps,  the  events  that  created  their  personal  catastrophe  may  be  for  gotten.   Just  a  few  days  ago,  these  SLA  fighters  had  hoped  to  hold  onto  their  outposts  in  the  eastern  sector  of  Southern  Lebanon  long  enough  for  arrangements  to  be  made  to  evacuate  their  fam  ilies.  But  18  years  of  support  from  Israel  may  have  made  the  2500  SLA  militiamen  too  self-con  fident  about  their  ability  to  fend  for  themselves.   Within  hours,  Israel  advised  them  to  flee  their  predominantly  Maronite  Christian  village  of  Ayn  Dibil  before  Hezbollah  gunmen  triumphantly  marched  in  to  celebrate  what  they  see  as  their  victory  over  the  Jewish  State.  “We  had  no  idea  it  would  disintegrate  so  fast,”  said  one  SLA  soldier.  “The  Israelis  said  they  would  first  make  arrange   ments  for  our  families.”   Still,  much  of  the  anger  was  focused  on  Lebanon.  Although  the  SLA  fighters  know  that  they  are  considered  traitors  in  Lebanon,  they  insist  they  had  fought  to  protect  themselves,   Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  receives  a  bouquet  of  flowers  outside  his  office  after  bringing  the  army  home.

Some  hoped  an  arrangement  with  the  government  might  allow  them  to  stay  in  their  homes.   “Lebanon  has  no  control  over  the  situation,”  said  Dori,  who  crossed  the  border  with  his  brother,  an  SLA  fighter,  and  many  other  family  members.  “There  are  a  lot  of  people  in  Lebanon  who  do  not  want  this  situation,  but  they  are  afraid  to  speak  out.”   Dori,  whose  father  was  killed  fighting  for  the  SLA  during  its  early  years,  speaks  fluent  Hebrew,  sports  a  ponytail  and  works  as  a  bellboy  at  a  hotel  in  Herzliya.  He  is  among  about  2500  civil  ians  from  Southern  Lebanon  who  have  enjoyed  the  privilege  of  working  in  Israel.  “When  the  Israelis  left,  we  only  hoped  the  Lebanese  Army  would  come,  but  Hezbollah  came  instead  and  we  had  no  choice,”  he  said.   Some  people  did  have  a  choice.  Many  of  the  SLA’s  Shi’ite  Muslim  fighters  —  who  made  up  about  60  percent  of  the  militia—opted  to  stay  in  Lebanon,  hoping  their  ethnic  ties  with  Hezbollah  would  keep  them  safe.  There  were  few  Shi’ites  among  the  refugees.   Christians  felt  less  secure.  “We  cannot  go  back,”  said  one  Christian  SLA  member.  “Anyone  who  has  left  home  as  a  traitor  will  be  killed.”   Refugees  who  have  been  in  contact  with  their  relatives  who  stayed  behind  say  there  were  reports  of  Hezbollah  blowing  up  homes  that  belonged  to  SLA  officers.  Other  stories  were  being  told  of  Hezbollah  taking  over  a  local   church  for  Muslim  prayers.  Hezbollah  gunmen  also  ransacked  the  home  of  the  SLA’s  command  er,  General  Antoine  Lahad  (see  separate  story).  Most  of  the  SLA  members  who  stayed  behind  were  transferred  to  the  Lebanese  authorities  for  trial.   Meanwhile,  the  refugees  realised  the  gates  were  shutting  behind  them.  Naim  Munther,  a  Druse  SLA  fighter,  was  standing  at  the  roadside  with  his  family,  desperate  to  catch  a  taxi  back  to  the  border  after  hearing  from  family  mem  bers  he  would  be  safe.  His  wife  was  in  tears,  realising  that  they  could  lose  any  chance  to  get   their  home  back  if  they  did  not  move  fast.  He  was  furious  at  Israel,  despite  pledges  from  sen  ior  officials  to  help  all  refugees  start  a  new  life.  “We  served  them,  walked  with  them  and  fought  with  them  and  they  just  dropped  us  like  dogs,”  said  Munther.  “Why  should  I  come  here?”   As  others  come  to  terms  with  losing  their  homes,  they  expect  Israel  to  make  good  on  its  promises.  “They  have  a  moral  obligation  to  us,""  said  one  SLA  fighter,  speaking  fluent  Hebrew.  “We  helped  Israel  a  lot  over  the  years.  All  we  ask  now  is  that  the  Israelis   please  help  us.”   JTA ",2000-06-02
"  Israel  braced  for   Ramadan  violence   JERUSALEM:  As  the  Israeli-Palestinian  violence  entered  its  third  month  this  week,  representa  tives  from  the  two  sides  are  trying  to  reduce  the  scale  of  the  fighting.  There  has  even  been  talk  of  a  new  initiative  to  reach  a  peace  deal.   But  the  real  test  of  these  efforts  will  be  seen  on  the  ground,  where  the  violence  continues  to  claim  Israeli  and  Palestinian  lives.   With  the  start  on  Monday  of  the  Muslim  holy  month  of  Ramadan  traditionally  a  time  for  Islamic  militancy,  Israeli  security  forces  are  brac  ing  for  the  conflict  to  intensify.   The  two  sides  met  on  the  diplomatic  and  security  level.  In  a  call  initiated  by  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin,  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  and  Palestinian  Authority  President  Yasser  Arafat  pledged  to  work  to  resume  securi  ty  co-ordination.   The  day  before,  Israel  ordered  the  joint  liaison  offices  with  the  Palestinians  closed  after  an  Israeli  soldier  was  killed  in  a  blast  at  one  of  the  Gaza  Strip  offices.  That  telephone  conversation  was  followed  by  a  reported  meeting  between  Arafat  and  Israeli  Cabinet  Minister  Amnon  Lipkin-Shahak.  And  also  this  week,  the  head  of  Israel’s  Shin  Bet  domestic  security  service,  Avi  Dichter,  met  in  Egypt  with  the  head  of  the  Palestinian  security  service  in  Gaza,  Mohammed   Dahlan.   At  the  same  time,  regional  commanders  of  the   Israel  Defence  Force  reportedly  met  with  their  Palestinian  security  counterparts.   The  site  of  the  Dichter-Dahlan  meeting  indi  cates  that  Egypt  is  not  yet  abandoning  its  role  of  mediator,  even  though  it  recalled  its  ambassa  dor  to  Israel  last  week.   Also  this  week,  Egyptian  President  Hosni  Mubarak  met  Barak’s  chief  security  adviser,  Danny  Yatom.  During  the  meeting,  Mubarak  reportedly  told  Yatom  that  Israel  must  imple  ment  confidence-building  measures  before  the  Palestinian  Authority  can  justify  taking  any  steps  to  stop  the  violence.   As  a  gesture  linked  to  Ramadan,  Israel  reopened  the  Kami  Crossing  into  Gaza  to  allow  the  flow  of  food,  medicines  and  other  essentials.   Despite  the  contacts,  violence  on  the  ground  has  continued  largely  unabated,  with  at  least  10  Palestinians  and  two  Israelis  killed  in  clashes  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  early  this  week.   The  Jerusalem  neighbourhood  of  Gilo  again  came  under  fire  from  the  Arab  town  of  Beit  Jalla,  and  gun  battles  erupted  in  the  West  Bank  after  Israeli  troops  killed  five  Palestinians  near  Kalkilya.  In  that  incident,  Israeli  soldiers  opened  fire  after  they  “identified  an  armed  gang  of  ter  rorists”  that  had  opened  fire  on  an  Israeli  vehicle  travelling  towards  a  Jewish  settlement,  accord  ing  to  an  armv  statement.  Palestinian  officials   said  the  five  were  unarmed  civilians.   JTA ",2000-12-01
"  Close   encounters  of  a   nasty  kind   CHICAGO:  Virulent  anti-Jewish  and  anti-Israel  remarks  were  espoused  at  a  joint  press  confer  ence  held  by  Nation  of  Islam  leader  Louis  Farrakhan  and  four  rabbis  from  the  ultra  Orthodox,  anti-Zionist  group  Neturei  Karta.   Neturei  Karta  Rabbi  Yisroel  Dovid  Weiss  said  the  Holocaust  was  divine  punishment  of  the  Jews  for  their  abandonment  of  the  Torah.  He  also  said  that  Farrakhan  —  who  has  called  Judaism  a  “gutter  religion”  —  was  dedicated  to  “the  better  ing  of  mankind”,  claiming  that  until  the  advent  of  the  Zionist  movement,  Jews  lived  in  peace  with  their  neighbours.   “Judaism  is  Godliness,  and  Zionism  is  materi  alism  and  politics,”  he  said.  “Judaism  is  humble  and  Zionism  is  arrogance.  Zionism  is  an  abomi  nation  and  a  heresy  to  God.”   Based  in  Jerusalem,  Neturei  Karta  seeks  the  dismantling  of  the  Jewish  State,  saying  Jews  must  wait  for  the  Messiah  before  establishing  Israel,  which  Rabbi  Weiss  referred  to  as  Palestine.  If  Jews  had  been  willing  to  speak  to  Hitler,  perhaps  “hundreds  of  thousands  of  Jews  would  have  avoided  the  gas  chambers”,  he  added.  His  views  were  echoed  by  Nation  of  Islam’s  Leonard  Muhammad,  who  quoted  Farrakhan’s  view  that  Israel  will  “spit  out  those  who  are  not  righteous”.   Rabbi  Weiss  said  Farrakhan’s  antisemitic  state  ments  had  been  misconstrued.  In  a  pamphlet  issued  by  Neturei  Karta,  the  group  claims  that  by  Farrakhan  calling  Hitler  a  “great  man”,  it  is  “abun  dantly  clear  that  the  Minister  was  praising   Hitler’s  economic  achievements”.   Introducing  the  rabbis,  Muhammad  said  the  communities  have  visited  each  other  several  times.  “These  Jews  are  a  model  of  what  black  Jewish  relations  could  be,”  he  said.  “They  are  not  handicapped  by  the  pressures  of  organised  Jewish  groups,”  he  added,  referring  to  main  stream  Jewish  opposition  to  meeting  with   Farrakhan.   The  press  conference  was  held  after  the  Second  International  Islamic  Conference,  which  brought  together  Farrakhan’s  group  with  Imam  W  Deen  Mohammed,  leader  of  the  Muslim  American  Society  and  son  of  Elijah  Muhammad,  who  led  Nation  of  Islam  for  decades.  After  his  death  in  1975,  his  son  led  the  movement  towards  orthodoxy,  and  in  1978  Farrakhan  broke  away   under  the  Nation  of  Islam  name.   Farrakhan  and  W  Deen  addressed  20,000  sup  porters  at  the  rally—with  the  Neturei  Karta  rab  bis  at  Farrakhan’s  side.   American  Jewish  Committee  official  Jonathan  Levine  criticised  Farrakhan  for  “passing  off  a  tiny  sect  of  Jews  best  known  for  equating  Zionism  with  Nazism  as  representative  of  a  new  relation   I  ship  with  the  Jewish  community”.   r   JUFNews ",2000-03-10
"  On  the  table:  How  to  carve  up  Jerusalem   ANALYSIS   David  Landau   JERUSALEM:  As  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  engages  this  week  in  Middle  East  summitry,  there  is  one  issue  on  which  he  can  afford  to  make  the  fewest  concessions:  Jerusalem.   Struggling  to  hold  together  the  vestiges  of  his  governing  majority  before  leaving  for  Camp  David,  Barak  assured  the  nation  on  the  eve  of  his  departure  that  Jerusalem  would  remain  undivided  under  Israeli  sovereignty  in  any  peace  treaty  with  the  Palestinians.   This,  the  premier  declared  in  a  live  televi  sion  appearance,  was  one  of  his  guiding  prin  ciples  as  he  entered  the  historic  and  crucial  negotiations.   Meanwhile,  however,  Israeli  politicians  and  pundits  were  busily  swapping  what  they  con  sidered  reliable  information  about  the  con  cessions  Barak  is  ready  to  make  regarding  Jerusalem  and  other  key  issues.   As  evidence,  they  pointed  to  the  premier’s  reluctance  to  share  his  “red  lines”  —  or  the  limits  of  his  negotiating  stance  —  with  the  leader  of  the  fervently  Orthodox  Shas  Party.   Along  with  Shas  officials,  Interior  Minister  Natan  Sharansky  of  the  Yisrael  Ba’AIiyah  Party  has  complained  that  Barak  has  refused  to  share  his  negotiating  plans  with  his  coali  tion  partners.  On  Sunday,  Shas,  Yisrael  Ba’AIiyah  and  the  National  Religious  Party  resigned  from  the  government.   Barak’s  office,  however,  maintained  that,  along  with  his  Jerusalem  stance,  the  premier  made  his  other  red  lines  abundantly  clear  during  his  televised  address:   ■  No  return  to  the  borders  that  existed  prior  to  the  1967  Six-Day  War;   ■  No  foreign  army  inside  the  West  Bank;   H  The  majority  of  Jewish  settlers  would  live  under  Israeli  sovereignty;   B  No  acceptance  by  Israel  of  legal  or  moral  responsibility  for  the  creation  of  the  Palestinian  refugee  problem.   Barak  himself  told  the  nation  during  the  address  that  it  would  be  prejudicial  to  the  national  interest  for  him  to  go  into  detail  on  any  of  the  key  points,  beyond  the  carefully   chosen  words  he  had  used.   Specifically,  he  declined  to  tell  reporters  whether  he  was  ready  to  agree  to  Muslim  and  Christian  control  of  their  holy  sites  within  the  walls  of  Jerusalem’s  Old  City.   However,  a  senior  Israeli  official  presenting  Barak’s  negotiating  stance  did  say  that  Barak  would  ensure  that  the  Palestinians  allow  complete  access  to  any  Jewish  holy  places  that  may  fall  inside  a  future  Palestinian  state.   Jerusalem  and  the  refugee  issue  are  the  two  most  intractable  issues  facing  the  two  sides  as  they  headed  for  Camp  David.   The  fact  that  there  will  be  some  changes,  though  relatively  small  ones,  in  the  pre-1967  lines  is  taken  in  Israel  as  a  given.  If  Palestinian  Authority  President  Yasser  Arafat  sticks  to  his  public  demand  for  a  return  to  the  1967  boundaries,  there  will  be  no  agree   ment.   It  is  also  widely  believed  that  the  two  sides  have  agreed  to  a  demilitarised  Palestinian  state  and  the  stationing  of  Israeli  troops  at  selected  key  points  on  the  Jordan  River.   Similarly,  it  is  also  believed  that  Israel  will  be  able  to  annex  three  settlement  blocs  close  to  the  old  border  —  although  the  Palestinians  are  said  to  be  demanding  com  pensatory  slices  of  Israeli  territory  alongside  the  Gaza  Strip.   This  annexation  was  originally  proposed  in  the  “Beilin-Abu  Mazen”  agreement,  an  infor  mal  accord  negotiated  during  1995  between  Yossi  Beilin,  now  Barak’s  justice  minister,  and  Abu  Mazen,  Arafat’s  second-in-command.   On  Jerusalem,  the  Beilin-Abu  Mazen  accord  envisaged  a  Palestinian  capital,  to  be  called  “al-Quds”  —  or  “holy  city”,  the  Arabic  name  for  Jerusalem  —  alongside  the  city’s  present  boundaries.   Those  boundaries  —  drawn  up  by  then   Defence  Minister  Moshe  Dayan  in  the  wake  of  the  1967  war  and  subsequently  proclaimed  sovereign  Israeli  soil  by  the  Knesset  —  do  not  embrace  important  Palestinian  suburbs  such  as  Abu  Dis,  Azariya  and  a-Ram.   These  areas,  Beilin  and  Abu  Mazen  believed,  could  develop  and  become  a  credi  ble  Palestinian  capital.   Since  1995,  in  a  tacit  recognition  of  the  acceptability  of  the  Beilin-Abu  Mazen  scheme,  Israel  has  turned  a  blind  eye  to  the  Palestinians’  construction  of  a  large  and  impressive  building  in  Abu  Dis  that  is  intend   ed  to  serve  as  their  Parliament  building.   Other  civilian  and  official  construction  projects  have  continued  in  the  Palestinian  areas  —  though  not  nearly  as  intensively  as  the  Jewish  residential  construction  in  the  ring  of  Jewish  suburbs  deliberately  created  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  to  encircle  Jerusalem  and  effectively  detach  it  from  the  West  Bank.   The  Palestinian  position  on  the  eve  of  the  summit  is  that  Beilin-Abu  Mazen  is  deficient.   They  insist  on  control  of  the  Temple  Mount  and  the  Muslim  Quarter  of  the  Old  City.  They  also  insist  on  control  of  Palestinian  areas  within  Jerusalem  that  are  close  to  the  Old  City  walls  —  such  as  Sheik  Jarrah,  the  American  Colony  and  Wadi  Joz.   Informed  Israeli  observers  said  this  week   that  while  the  question  of  sovereignty  and  flags  over  the  Temple  Mount  was  capable  of  resolution  —  especially  since  Jewish  reli  gious  law  forbids  entry  onto  the  mount  —  the  question  of  sovereignty  over  the  Palestinian  areas  within  the  city  could  pre  vent  an  agreement  from  being  reached.   Unlike  Abu  Dis  and  Azariya,  these  areas  within  Jerusalem  are  more  familiar  to  Jewish  residents  of  Jerusalem,  though  much  less  so  than  before  the  1987-1993  intifada,  or  Palestinian  uprising.   These  Israeli  observers  contend  that  even  though  the  Palestinians  are  reluctant  to  admit  it,  they  will  concede  that  the  Israeli  areas  in  post-1967  eastern  Jerusalem  are  there  to  stay  —  as  part  of  Israel.  This  applies  to  Pisgat  Ze’ev,  Neveh  Ya’acov,  Ramat  Shafat,  Ramot,  French  Hill,  Ramot  Eshkol,  Gilo  and  —  the  scene  of  the  most  recent  controversy   —  Har  Homa.   It  applies,  too,  to  the  large  settlements  just  beyond  Jerusalem:  Ma’aleh  Adumim  to  the  east,  Beit  El  to  the  north  and  the  Gush  Etzion  bloc  to  the  south.   The  Palestinians  must  realise,  say  these  observers,  that  no  Israeli  government  could  turn  over  any  of  these  areas  and  hope  to  sur  vive  politically.   But  the  Palestinian  negotiators  are  insist  ing  that  the  Palestinian  people  live  under  their  own  sovereignty  —  and  this  includes  not  only  the  500,000  Palestinians  living  in  the  Greater  Jerusalem  area,  but  also  the  180,000  who  live  within  the  present  city  limits.   Arafat  wants  the  residents  of  Sheik  Jarrah,  for  example,  not  only  to  vote  for  the  Palestinian  Parliament  —  a  right  Israel  has  already  recognised  —  and  to  carry  Palestinian  passports,  but  to  live  on  Palestinian  sovereign  soil.   But  to  carve  up  the  city  would  flatly  con  tradict  Barak’s  pledge  of  a  “united  Jerusalem  under  Israeli  sovereignty”.   Hence  the  intractability  of  the  problem,  despite  the  two  sides’  purported  pre-summit   concessions.   A  solution  will  require  further  flexibility  and  ingenuity  if  they  are  to  emerge  reason  ably  satisfied  —  and  with  their  respective  declarations  of  unswerving  allegiance  to  the   Holy  City  intact.

"  ANALYSIS   Michael  Jordan   NEW  YORK:  The  case  of  the  13  Iranian  Jews  accused  of  spying  —  which  took  a  twist  when  five  of  them  allegedly  confessed  —  apparently  originated  as  a  power  struggle  with  in  Iran’s  Jewish  community.   But  it  wasn’t  long  before  the  dis  pute  was  sucked  into  the  greater  drama  that  has  convulsed  Iran  dur  ing  the  past  few  years  —  the  pitched  battle  for  supremacy  between  Iranian  hardliners  and  their  reformist  rivals.   And  if  history  serves  as  a  guide,  presumably  this  won’t  be  the  last  time  that  Iran’s  2700-year-old  Jewish  community  will  be  a  pawn  in  the  country’s  political  struggles.   Since  the  Islamic  Revolution  of  1979  —  even  as  Iranian  Jewry  has  shrivelled  from  100,000  to  25,000  people  —  17  Jews  have  been  execut  ed,  primarily  for  being  accused  spies.  Two  were  executed  in  Teheran  three  years  ago.   American  Jewish  observers,  human  rights  groups  and  foreign  diplomats  have  denounced  the  hear  ings  as  a  political  show-trial.  Convictions  could  bring  anything  from  six  months  in  prison  to  a  death   sentence.   The  emigration  of  Iranian  Jews  since  1979  has  left  a  vacuum  in  lead  ership,  as  many  religious  and  com  munity  figures  were  among  the  emi  gres  who  headed  to  Israel  and  the  United  States.  The  Jewish  leadership  was  traditionally  based  in  Teheran,  the  capital.  Jews  more  or  less  have  been  allowed  to  maintain  a  commu  nal  life,  as  long  as  it  was  low-key  and   was  not  seen  as  a  threat  to  the  Islamic  state   ■  Editorial:  The  farce  of  Iranian  justice  -  page  16   Appeasing  the  authorities  ensured  a  modicum  of  security,  said  Sam  Kermanian,  secretary-general  of  the  Los  Angeles-based  American  Iranian  Jewish  Federation.  However,  recent  years  have  seen  Jews  in  the  south  ern  city  of  Shiraz  —  a  bastion  of  reli  gious  conservatism  in  general  —  grow  more  committed  and  energetic  in  their  religious  life,  Kermanian  said.   Most  Iranian  Jews  are  Orthodox,  but  the  Shiraz  community  appeared  to  be  growing  more  ultra-Orthodox  in  its  practices,  which  many  young  Jews  found  appealing.  Because  of  that  growing  appeal,  the  Shiraz  Jews  soon  became  a  source  of  irritation  to  the  Iranian  authorities,  who  presum  ably  preferred  dealing  with  the  Jewish  leadership  in  Teheran.   The  Shiraz  Jews  allegedly  ignored  warnings  from  both  government  offi  cials  and  Jewish  leaders  in  Teheran  to  tone  down  and  limit  their  activi  ties,  Kermanian  said.   Three  of  the  13  Iranian  Jews  on  trial  for  spying,  from  left:  Navid  Balazadeh,  17,  Omid  Tefileen,  26,   outside  the  Iranian  Revolutionary  Court  in  Shiraz  last  week.   and  Nejat  Broukhim,  36,   Photo:  AAP/AP   The  arrests  in  January  and  March  1999  of  the  13  Jews  —  most  of  whom  are  from  Shiraz  —  may  have  been  meant  to  send  a  message.  Very  little  is  known  about  the  13,  but  among  them  is  the  chief  spiritual  leader  of  Shiraz,  several  part-time  Hebrew  teachers,  a  university  professor,  a  cemetery  worker,  an  office  clerk,  a  tailor  and  a  17-year-old  student,  according  to  sources  here.   “The  Iranians  implicitly  men  tioned  that  the  arrests  were  related  to  the  warnings,”  said  Kermanian.  “They  needed  to  make  it  clear  to  the  people  that  they  were  serious  —  basically  to  punish  them  and  scare  them  off  —  and  that  they  were  going  to  be  released  shortly.”   Other  observers,  however,  sug  gest  that  the  hardliners  —  vying  to  maintain  a  grip  on  power  in  the  wake  of  political  victories  by  reformists  —  had  already  fingered  the  Jews  as  the  engine  with  which  to  whip  up  Islamic  fervour  and  undermine  the  liberalis  ing  efforts  of  moderates  like  Iranian  President  Mohammad  Khatami.   I   Jews  are  second  only  to  Iran’s  Baha’i  minority  as  favourite  targets  of  the  authorities  to  rally  the  public  against  a  common  enemy,  according   to  observers.   The  intra-communal  dispute  “played  some  role  at  the  beginning,  but  we  shouldn’t  exaggerate  it  or  exonerate  the  Iranian  authorities  for  pinning  this  on  the  Jews,”  said  Malcolm  Hoenlein,  executive  vice  chairman  of  the  Conference  of  Presidents  of  Major  American  Jewish  Organisations.  “We  heard  they  had  targeted  the  Jews  for  politi  cal  purposes.  It  fits  the  periodic  pat  tern.  The  difference  this  time  is  that  we  found  out  about  it  in  time  and   have  been  able  to  do  something   about  it.”   Once  the  arrests  became  public,  the  situation  was  apparently  exacer  bated,  say  observers,  with  Iranian  hardliners  becoming  more  adamant  about  punishing  the  13.  The  situa  tion  prompted  debates  among  advo  cates  about  whether  public  or  pri  vate  diplomacy  would  be  more  effec   tive  in  securing  their  release.   “We  gave  the  Iranians  many  opportunities  to  negotiate,  and  it  all  came  to  naught,”  said  Hoenlein,  who  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  negotia  tions  on  the  detainees’  behalf,  work  ing  through  his  network  of  contacts  in  Iran,  Europe  and  America.   Before  launching  the  campaign  to  secure  their  release,  Hoenlein  said  his  organisation  conducted  its  own  investigation  into  the  spying  charges.  Consultations  with  officials  from  the  CIA,  the  FBI  and  the  Mossad  confirmed  that  the  allegations  had  been  fabricated,  he  said.   Without  the  international  inter  vention,  he  speculates  that  some  or  all  of  the  Iran  13  might  have  been  executed  by  now.   In  addition  to  the  international  attention  surrounding  the  current  case,  the  other  major  difference  from  previous  spying  charges  against  Iranian  Jews  is  the  rising  tension  within  Iranian  society.  Indeed,  the  handling  of  the  Iran  13  speaks  vol  umes  about  the  current  political  cli  mate.  The  Muslim  fundamentalists  who  control  Iran’s  judiciary  are  clearly  out  to  sabotage  the  small  steps  taken  by  their  reformist  rivals  to  repair  relations  with  the  West,  say  US  observers.  At  this  point,  anything  less  than  convictions  of  some  or  all  the  “Zionist  spies”  would  mean  los  ing  face  among  their  followers.   More  significantly,  in  the  past  two  weeks  the  hardliners  have  jailed  six  journalists  and  shut  down  16  reform  minded  newspapers  that  have  regis  tered  support  for  Khatami.  Among  the  stated  reasons  for  the  newspa   per  closures  was  their  alleged  sym  pathy  for  the  13  Jews.   In  such  an  atmosphere,  some  won  der  why  any  Iranian  Jew  remains  wedded  to  the  country.  Some  sug  gest  that  everyone  who  remains  has  at  least  one  or  two  relatives  in  the  United  States.  However,  while  those  who  left  generally  had  the  financial  means  to  do  so,  those  who  remain  are  said  to  be  either  too  poor,  old,  complacent  —  or  simply  too  stub  born  to  sever  a  long  tradition.   While  flowery  reports  often  emerge  from  Iran  on  how  happy  Jews  there  are,  they  are  vulnerable  to  more  than  spying  charges.  In  December,  the  body  of  a  44-year-old  Teheran  Jew  was  discovered.  His  Muslim  business  partner,  with  whom  the  victim  had  had  a  conflict,  had  reported  him  to  the  authorities  the  previous  day,  said  Hoenlein.   But  espionage  remains  the  most  popular  accusation  to  make  against  perceived  enemies.  “We  cannot  go  on  the  assumption  this  will  not  hap  pen  again,”  said  Kermanian.  “As  to  why  stay,  that’s  the  million-dollar  question  for  many  Jewish  communi  ties  around  the  world.  I  guess  one  answer  is  that  Jews  are  eternal  opti  mists.  Iranian  history  has  had  its  ups  and  downs,  and  Jews  went  through  it  with  them.  They  always  survived.  I  don’t  think  there  will  ever  be  a  time  that  Iran  will  be  devoid  of  Jewish   life.’   JTA ",2000-05-12
"  British  Jewry’s  first  female   head  concerned  with  survival   Richard  Allen  Greene   LONDON:  The  first  woman  to  be  elected  leader  of  the  umbrella  organisation  that  represents  most  of  Britain’s  283,000  Jews  plans  to  reach  out  to  young,  unaffiliated   Jews.   The  failure  to  attract  young  peo  ple  is  “not  just  a  problem  in  the  Jewish  community”,  said  Jo  Wagerman.  “Young  people  are  either  abandoning  their  culture  or  becoming  fundamentalists”  in  Christian,  Muslim  and  Sikh  com  munities,  as  well  as  among  Jews,   she  said.   The  Board  of  Deputies  of  British  Jews  last  week  elected  Wagerman  the  first  woman  president  in  its  240-year  history.  A  former  senior  vice-president,  she  was  elected  unopposed  for  a  three-year  term.   Saying  she  was  “delighted""  that  no-one  ran  against  her,  she  said:  “I  take  that  as  a  great  compliment.”   Wagerman  made  little  of  being  the  first  woman  elected  to  the  position,  other  than  to  say  it  marked  the  “end  of  the  era  in  which  all  Jewish  women  could  do  was  make  the  tea.  It’s  not  that  I  am  leading  the  army”  of  women,  she  said;  “it’s  just  that  the  tide  is  going  in  that  direction.”   About  55  percent  of  Britain’s  283,000  Jews  are  women.  Wagerman  emphasised  that  she  wanted  to  be  president  of  an  inclu  sive  organisation.  Members  of  the  ultra-Orthodox  community  are  not  represented  on  the  Board,  nor  are  Jews  who  are  not  affiliated  with  a  synagogue.  According  to  some  estimates,  those  two  groups  make  up  nearly  40  percent  of  British  Jewry.   A  study  by  the  Institute  for  Jewish  Policy  Research  —  a  British   think-tank  —called  for  the  creation  of  a  more  representative,  more  inclusive  structure  to  represent  British  Jewry.  Many  saw  that  study’s  report,  A  Community  of  Communities,  as  an  implicit  cri  tique  of  the  Board.   “We  are  the  most  representative  thing  we’ve  got,”  Wagerman  said  in  defence  of  the  Board.  “The  only  groups  not  represented  are  those  which  do  not  wish  to  be,  or  are  oli  garchic,  rather  than  democratic.”   Wagerman  said  she  planned  to  preside  over  an  organisation  that   was  able  to  overcome  rivalries  and  differences.  “We  are  not  homoge  nous.  We  are  always  going  to  be   Jo  Wagerman  ...  “We  must  stop  thinking  in  terms  of  ‘my  territory,  your  territory’,  if  we  don’t  do  that,  we’re  going  to  die.””   different,”  she  said  of  Britain’s  Jews.  “That  should  not  prevent  us  from  working  together.  If  we  preach  respect  to  others,  we  have  to  practise  it  at  home,”  she  said,  admitting  that  “there  have  been  occasions  in  the  past  when  those  crying  loudest  for  tolerance  have  been  slow  to  give  it  themselves.”   Wagerman  stressed  the  impor   tance  of  Britain’s  Jewish  organisa  tions  working  together.  “In  the  past,  organisations  have  been  a  lit  tle  bit  territorial.  We  must  stop  thinking  in  terms  of  ‘my  territory,  your  territory’  and  work  together  in  a  co-operative  way.  If  we  don’t  do  that,  we’re  not  going  to  survive  as  a  community,”  she  warned.  “We’re  going  to  die.”  JTA ",2000-07-28
"  Antiquities  chiefs  shock  resignation   Etgar  LefScovits  and  Arieh  O’Sullivan   JERUSALEM:  The  Israeli  government’s  acceptance  of  illegal  excavations  on  the  Temple  Mount  is  being  touted  as  a  reason  behind  the  surprise  resignation  of  Amir  Drori  as  head  of  the  Antiquities  Authority.   The  former  Golani  commander  and  deputy  chief  of  General  Staff  quit  only  three  months  after  his  term  had  been  extended  by  five   years.   He  reportedly  told  Antiquities  Authority  workers  that,  after  12  years  in  the  post,  it  was  fitting  that  a  new  director  be  chosen.  However,  there  has  been  speculation  among  archaeologists  and  the  media  that  Drori’s  res  ignation  is  in  part  due  to  the  stand  the  Authority  took  on  the  illegal  Temple  Mount  construction  undertaken  by  the  Wakf,  the  Muslim  body  with  authority  over  Judaism’s   holiest  site.   The  Authority’s  internal  and  financial  diffi  culties  have  been  cited  as  another  possible  reason  for  Drori,  who  has  in  the  past  been  the  target  of  haredi  attempts  to  oust  him  over  the  excavation  of  ancient  graves,  to  resign.   In  recent  months,  he  has  found  himself  in  the  uneasy  position  of  having  to  deal  with  the  government’s  political  decision  not  to  stop   the  construction  work  on  the  Temple  Mount.  As  head  of  the  authority,  Drori,  who  has  just  turned  63,  was  responsible  for  the  supervi  sion  of  archaeological  sites.   “It  is  clear  that  the  government  has  turned  him  into  a  circus  clown,  faced  with  consider  able  pressure  to  say  half-truths  or  plain  untruths”  said  Dr  Eilat  Mazar,  from  the  Committee  Against  the  Destruction  of  Antiquities  on  the  Temple  Mount,  an  apoliti  cal  organisation  which  has  been  lobbying  the  government  to  stop  the  Wakf  work.   “No  logistical  or  financial  problems  alone  could  have  caused  him  to  resign  at  the  start  of  his  new  term,”  Mazar  said.   Appearing  before  the  Knesset  Education  Committee  recently  to  discuss  the  Wakf  con  struction  on  the  Temple  Mount,  Drori  seemed  both  pained  and  uneasy,  saying  “1  wish  I  knew  how  to  deal  with  this  issue  with  in  the  parameters  that  the  government  has   set”.   Drori  told  Israel  Radio  last  month  that  the  Wakf  work,  which  he  had  earlier  called  an  “archaeological  crime”  continued  to  damage  antiquities.   He  added  that  “the  political  echelon  has  allowed  the  work  to  continue,  and,  in  essence,  the  authority  of  the  Antiquities  Authority  has  been  taken  away”.   Some  Authority  archaeologists  denied  that  Drori  was  leaving  over  the  Wakf’s  actions.   “Drori’s  resignation  has  absolutely  nothing  to  do  with  the  Temple  Mount.  He  felt  that  he  was  too  long  in  the  job,  and  that  the  time  had  come  for  a  new  generation,”  Jerusalem  regional  archaeologist  Jon  Seligman  said.   His  battles  with  haredim  over  grave  exca  vations  took  a  personal  toll,  as  he  was  sub  jected  to  recurrent  telephone  harassment.  But  his  steadfast  stand  against  the  haredim  won  him  respect  in  the  authority  and  many  workers  are  said  to  be  deeply  saddened  by  his  departure.   Drori  will  remain  in  his  position  until  a  replacement  is  found.   Jerusalem  rosi ",2000-08-11
"  School’s  “intolerance”  saddens  world  Reform  leader   Stefan  BSalogusIki   THE  legal  discrimination  by  Perth’s  Jewish  dayschool  against  the  child  of  a  Reform  convert  reflects  “intolerance  and  a  growing  polarisation”  in  the  Jewish  commu  nity,  World  Union  for  Progressive  Judaism  president  Rabbi  Richard  Block  charged  this  week.   Perth  community  members  Helen  and  Gary  Goldberg  took  Carmel  School  to  the  Equal  Opportunities  Tribunal  last  year  because  of  restrictions  which  Carmel  School  had  placed  on  their  son  Gregory,  who  is  not  Halachically  Jewish.   Speaking  from  Jerusalem,  Rabbi  Block  —  who  will  be  in  Sydney  later  this  month  (see  page  20)  —   told  the  AJN:  “It’s  an  unfortunate  situation  which  reflects  intoler  ance  and  a  growing  polarisation  in  the  Jewish  community  which  does  n’t  benefit  anyone.”   The  Tribunal  dismissed  the   Goldbergs’  case,  ruling  that  Carmel  had  in  fact  discriminated,  but  “in  good  faith”.   Rabbi  Block:  “It’s  always  unfortu  nate  when  internal  issues  in  the   Jewish  community  can’t  be  settled  among  ourselves  and  we  find  our  selves  appealing  to  non-Jewish   Helen  and  Gary  Goldberg.   authorities  who  are  naturally  reluc  tant  to  involve  themselves.  It’s  a  very  unfortunate  episode  which  doesn’t  reflect  well  on  the  school  or  the  community.  I  understand  that  Orthodox  institutions  have  the  right  to  set  criteria  for  them  selves,  but  in  that  particular  situa  tion,  where  Carmel  is  the  only  Jewish  dayschool  in  Perth,  they   missed  an  opportunity  to  be  a  force  for  Jewish  unity  in  the  com  munity.”   But  Carmel  spokesman  Julian  Sher  said  Rabbi  Block  had  missed  the  point.  “Carmel  was  never  intended  to  be  a  community  school;  it’s  specifically  an  Orthodox  school,”  he  stated.  “Anyone  can  come  here,  but  like   Rabbi  Richard  Block   any  denominational  school,  non  Jewish  children  are  not  allowed  to  do  certain  things  —  in  the  main,  things  which  relate  to  matters  of  Jewish  ritual,  such  as  being  called  up  for  an  aliyah.  The  fact  remains  that  Gregory  Goldman  could  have  come  to  the  school  and  he  would  have  suffered  no  prejudice  whatso  ever,  despite  being  born  of  a  non   Jewish  mother  from  an  Orthodox  perspective.”   Mr  Sher  accused  Rabbi  Block  of  trying  to  impose  his  movement’s  values  on  Carmel.   “He  is  saying  we  should  bend  our  rules,  but  they  aren’t  there  for  the  benefit  of  one  or  two  people.  They  are  matters  of  serious  and  fundamental  belief,  and  if  we  bend  these  rules,  we  will  be  prejudicing  and  messing  with  the  survival  of  the  Jewish  people.”   Mr  Goldberg  said  that  when  his  family  launched  its  action  against  Carmel,  it  was  never  “a  matter  of  religion;  it  was  about  putting  my  kids  in  a  caring  environment.  And  [Carmel]  said  ‘yes,  we’ll  take  your  kid,  but  we’ll  set  him  apart  from  the  others’.  1  would  have  reacted  the  way  I  did  if  a  Catholic,  Muslim  or  any  other  school  did  the  same.  If  that’s  what  they  do,  then  it  would  be  better  not  to  admit  Gregory  at  all.  It  was  never  about  Progressive  versus  Orthodox  Jews  —  that’s  what  Carmel  made  it.”   Rabbi  Block  will  visiting  Melbourne,  Adelaide  and  Sydney   this  month  —  but  not  Perth.  However,  he  said  he  would  like  to  visit  the  West  Australian  capital  if,  as  he  intends,  he  returns  to  Australia  in  November. ",2000-02-18
"  A  Blooming  Beauty  Called  Zamboanga   Thomas  E.  King   Zamboanga,  on  the  southern  tip  of  the  bird  beak-like  western  arm  of  heavily  forested  and  mineral-rich  Mindanao  -  the  second  largest  and  most  southerly  of  the  11  major  islands  of  the  Philippines  -  can  justifiably  claim  to  being  a  cauldron  of  culture.  This  city  is  more  ethnically  and  historically  diverse  than  any  other  in  the  disparate  nation.  Though  the  Philippines  is  an  integral  part  of  Southeast  Asia  it  is,  in  many  ways,  the  most  atypical  of  the  handful  of  nations  spread  over  the  vast  region.  To  start  with,  Filipinos  themselves  are  different  being  of  Malay-Polynesian  stock  with  blood  influences  from  China,  Indonesia,  Spain  and  the  USA.  And  then  there  are  the  nation's  past  colonial  affiliations,  language  origins  and  religious  convictions.  Spanish  rule  lasted  for  333  years  followed  by  nearly  50  years  of  American  government.  Centuries  of  zealous  work  by  Spanish  missionaries  introduced  and  nurtured  Christianity  as  well  as  a  new  language.  Though  now  a  republic  where  English  is  the  spoken  language  rather  than   the  former  'lingua  franca'  of  Spanish,  Christianity  continues  to  predominate  throughout  the  country.  That  is  everywhere  except  in  Mindanao  where  the  cross  meets  the  crescent  and  mosques  and  crescent-crested  minarets  are  almost  as  common  as  churches  and  cross-christened  steeples.  The  port  city  of  Zamboanga  like  many  other  large  centres  in  the  Philippines   has  a  Spanish-built  fort  and  like  most  others  in  Asia  has  a  thriving  market.  Similarities  end  there,  however,  as  it  has  little  in  common  with  other  cities  in  the  country  or,  indeed,  those  in  Asia.  The  early  Malay-speaking  settlers  noted  the  differences  calling  the  city  'Jambangan'  which  means  ""Land  of  Flowers"".  Because  of  its  relative  proximity  to  the  equator  that  results  in  a  hot  house  climate  Zamboanga  is  almost  overgrown  in  floral  offerings.  Bougainvillea  spills  from  flower  boxes  and  exotic  orchids  grow  wild.  Pasonanca  Park  is  a  blooming   good  attraction  and  an  excellent  introduction  to  the  city's  leisurely  lifestyle  and  traditional  outlook.  Festooned  with  year  round  foliage  the  park  has  mountain  spring-fed  swimming  pools  and  a  cozy  hideaway  without  comparison.  Although  there  are  quality  hotels  like  the  Zamboanga  Plaza  and  the  Lantaca  you  might  like  to  book  a  night  in  the  self-  contained  cottage  snugly  poised  on  top  of  a   massive  Acacia  Tree  within  the  core  of  the  park.

Locals  come  to  purchase  provisions  while  it's  the  adjunct  flea  market  that  will  entice  you  and  other  visitors  to  browse  and  buy.  Bargaining  is  brisk  at  this  waterfront  market  where  vendors  display  bright  fabrics  and  black  coral  jewellery,  products  of  pearl,  Chinese  porcelain,  musical  instruments,  tasty  mangosteen  preserves  and  intricately  designed  Muslim  brassware.  While  the  Spanish  were  never  able  to  completely  control  the  large  island  their  rule  did  extend  over  a  few  coastal  areas,  one  of  which  included  Zamboanga.  This  accounts  for  the  unmistakable  Hispanic  strains  which  still  pervade  this  unusual  city,  notably  a  distinct  language  and  a  solemn  fort  but  also  the  Spanish  ancestry  of  many  families,  the  architecture  of  country  estates  and  public  buildings  and  a  few  quaint  customs.  Directly  behind  the  wharf  is  Plaza  Pershing,  named  for  the  general  who  was  the  first  American  governor  over  the  local  Moras.  [The  Spanish  called  the  Muslim  people  of  uhis  island  and  a  few  minor  ones  nearby  ""Mores""  after  the  Arabs  [Moors]  whom  they  had  onveri  from  southern  Spam  t   centuries  earlier.)

Tapestries  and  table  runners  in  traditional  geometric  designs  and  striking  violets,  oranges,   greens  and  purples  have  earned  Yakan  mat  makers  and  loom  weavers  an  unsurpassed  reputation  for  high  quality  handiwork.  The  Yakans  are  but  one  of  five  minority  groups  living  in  and  around  Zamboanga.  The  Subanons  are  considered  to  be  the  original  people  of  Zamboanga  settling  here  long  before  the  Spanish  occupied  the  city  while  most  Badjaos,  the  sea  gypsies  of  the  nation,  spend  their  lives  on  smail  boats  which  shelter  in  the  waters  around  numerous  isles.

At  22  km  out  is  the  San  Ramon  Penal  Farm,  a  19th  century  Spanish-built  prison  where  inmates  who  have  served  a  portion  of  the  sentences  are  allowed  to  make  souvenirs,  mostly  from  wood,  and  sell  them  from  a  tiny  kiosk  outside  the  main  entrance  to  the  occasional  passerby.  Almost  equidistant  to  the  east  of  Zamboanga  is  Taluksangay,  a  settlement  that  is  home  to  a  number  of  Samal  and   Tausog  families.  Two  peculiarities  make  this  sedate  village  worth  a  visit:  its  picture  postcard  perfect  views  of  an  onion  domed  mosque  and  four  minarets  reflected  in  a   forest-fringed  lagoon  and  the  efforts  of  its  local  boat  builders.

"  “Let  the  Kosovars  stay!’'   PamawlftBMhna   AN  urgent  plea  for  the  Kosovar  refugees  to  be  allowed  to  stay  in  Australia  was  issued  this  week  by  Federal  MP  Michael  Danby.   The  Labor  Party  co-patron  of  the  Bandiana  Safe  Haven  in  Victoria  —  where  167  Kosovo  refugees  were  being  detained  as  illegal  immi  grants  —  Mr  Danby  attacked  the  Federal  Government’s  decision  that  the  167  Kosovars  and  15  others,  including  11  who  fled  safe  havens  in  Tasmania  and  NSW,  had  to  return  to  an  uncer  tain,  possibly  life-threatening,  future  in  Kosovo.   Echoing  Shadow  Immigration  Minister  Con  Sciacca,  Mr  Danby  said  the  government  is  “suf  fering  compassion  deficit  disorder”.  He  urged  it  to  show  charity  and  allow  the  refugees  to  apply  individually  for  special  protection  visas.   The  “illegal”  Kosovars  were  among  almost  4000  who  came  to  Australia  in  May  and  June  last  year,  fleeing  Serbian  “ethnic  cleansing”  during  the  war  in  Kosovo.  Immigration  Minister  Phil  Ruddock  declared  them  to  be  illegal  after  their   MP  Michael  Danby...   co-patron  of  Bandlana.   temporary  safe  haven  visas  expired  at  midnight  last  Saturday.   Mr  Danby,  the  Member  for  Melbourne  Ports,  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  as  co-patron  at  Bandiana,  he  has  spoken  to  many  families  and  individuals  about  their  immi  nent  forced  return.  “Australia  is  the  only  country  forcing  Kosovo  refugees  to  return.  The  Americans  have  issued  20,000  green  cards  to  Kosovars.  The   Canadians  have  said  all  their  refugees  (about  4000)  may  stay,  and  Germany  is  not  forcing  its  Kosovars  to  leave.  Australia  is  a  country  of  19  million  people.  We  should  let  these  people  stay.”   Mr  Danby  said  the  Kosovars  did  not  want  to  return  home  because  the  situation  had  deterio  rated  in  the  last  two  weeks.  “There  are  meant  to  be  6000  police  in  Kosovo  and  there  are  only  300  deployed.  The  situation  was  causing  fear  amongst  the  people  remaining  here,  and  they  had  very  substantial  grounds  to  be  frightened.”   He  saw  an  irony  in  his  attempts  as  a  Jew  to  keep  the  Muslim  Kosovars  in  Australia.  There  was  also  a  family  connection  with  the  Bandiana  army  base  where,  after  arriving  in  Australia  as  a  refugee  from  Germany  in  1939,  his  father  served  in  an  Australian  Army  employment  battalion.   The  forced  departure  of  the  Kosovars  follows  a  victory  for  the  government  when  Chief  Justice  Murray  Gleeson  rejected  an  attempt  by  81  Kosovars  to  obtain  protection  visas  and  an  injunction  to  stop  the  government  repatriating  them.  Lawyer  Basil  Nuredni  argued  that  Mr  Ruddock  had  failed  to  consider  relevant  sec  tions  of  a  UN  High  Commission  for  Refugees  (UNHCR)  report  when  considering  their  applica  tions  and  had  failed  to  accord  them  natural  jus   tice.   Mr  Ruddock  admitted  that  some  of  the  Kosovars  were  frightened  to  return,  but  others  were  refusing  to  return  believing  Australia  would  let  them  stay  if  they  waited  long  enough.  He  said  it  would  be  unfair  to  give  places  to  the  refugees  refusing  to  leave  Australia  as  this  would  deny  refuge  to  others  in  need  around  the  world.

"  Immigration   and   Multicultural  Affairs   Minister  Philip   Ruddock  (left)  with   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen   Rothman  at   the  meeting  with  Sydney   Jewish   leaders  last  week.   Sydney  Arab  leaders  not  doing  enough,  government  told   SteSasi  Bsatogpsslti   JEWISH  community  leaders  in  Sydney  and  Melbourne  have  called  on  the  Federal  Government  to  tackle  the  local  fallout  from  the  explosion  of  violence  in  Israel.   They  have  told  Immigration  and  Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  Phil  Ruddock  that  Arab  and  Muslim  leaders  have  not  done  enough  to  dis  courage  members  of  their  communities  from  pursuing  violence  against  Australia’s  Jews.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman,  who  led  an  11-strong  delegar  tion  to  meet  the  minister  last  week,  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News:  “We  don’t  accuse  the  leadership  of  the  Arab  community  of  inciting  acts  against  Jews,  but  we  don’t  think  they  are  doing  enough  to  ensure  that  members  of  their  communities  were  discouraged  from  so  acting.  We  asked  the  minister  that  in  forthcoming  meet  ings  with  the  Arab  community  that  they  be  encouraged  to  exercise  greater  control  over  members  of  their  community,  and  more  publicly  discourage  violence.”   Mr  Ruddock  was  given  details  of  attacks  against  Jewish  targets  in  recent  weeks.  “I  think  he  was  surprised  at  the  extent  of  the  security  needed  by  the  Jewish  community.  He  agreed  that  it  was  an  unfortunate  aspect  of  community  life  that  cultures  had  to  protect  themselves  from  attack  and  felt  that  it  was  inconsistent  with  a  normal  Australian  lifestyle.”   In  a  meeting  with  ACT  Jewish  Community  president  Dr  Alan  Shroot,  Mr  Ruddock  expressed  regret  that  a  Canberra  synagogue  had  been  firebombed.  He  emphasised  he  had  no  con  cerns  about  the  Jewish  community’s  reaction  to  events  in  the  Middle  East,  but  was  aware  of  inciteful  comments  on  Arab  radio  programs,   believing  there  was  “a  need  for  restraint”.   B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commission  executive  director  Danny  Ben-Moshe  said  that  in  a  meeting  in  Melbourne,  Victorian  Jewish  lead  ers  “shared  with  the  minister  literature  which  the  delegation  deemed  offensive,  such  as  Let  the  blood  of  Jews  run  thick  and  free,  circulating  on  the  internet  and  at  university  campuses.""   Both  in  Sydney  and  Melbourne,  community  leaders  expressed  support  for  people  on  both  sides  of  the  conflict  to  express  their  views.  But  Mr  Ben-Moshe  said  the  “incitement  and  vilifica  tion  which  has  been  seen  in  the  Arabic  media  and  on  the  streets  of  Australia  [are]  beyond  the  bounds  of  democratic  discourse”.   Mr  Rothman  said  the  issue  of  the  media’s  anti  Israel  bias  was  raised  with  Mr  Ruddock—in  par  ticular,  that  exhibited  by  the  ABC  and  SBS.  “Mr  Ruddock  stressed  that  both  were  independent  and  bound  by  legislative  charter  to  be  balanced.  But  he  would  support  any  process  which  made  the  ABC  and  SBS  more  balanced  in  their  cover  age,  without  conceding  that  their  coverage  has   been  unbalanced.”   Mr  Rothman  said  the  minister  was  open  to  the  idea  of  Jewish  community  leaders  being  able  to  brief  MPs,  particularly  government  ministers,  on  the  situation  in  the  Middle  East  to  help  balance  the  bias  of  media  reports.  “We  hope  the  minister  will  pass  on  our  views  to  Arab  leaders.  I  felt  it  was  an  extremely  positive  meeting.”   Zionist  Federation  of  Australia  president  Dr  Ron  Weiser:  “Mr  Ruddock  gave  us  a  good  hear  ing.  We  spent  about  90  minutes  with  him.  He  was  sympathetic  and  pointed  out  that  the  Prime  Minister  had  spoken  out  against  flag-burning  and  destruction  of  property.  And  he  said  he  would  issue  such  cautionary  notes  when  he  meets  the  Arab  leadership.” ",2000-11-03
"  ?   Keys  t  ENCOURAGING  young  people  to  stay  in  regional  towns  and  employing  economic  development  officers  have  been  cited  as  key  components  for  small  town  survival  following  a  study  tour  on  Eyre  Peninsula  this  month.  Tumby  Bay  community  development  officer  Janene  Piip  said  the  aim  of  the  Harvesting  Hometown  Jobs  Study  Tour  was  to  help  South  Australian  participants  realise  their  own  economic  and  community  development  opportunities.  Held  from  June  24  to  June  30,  representatives  from  around  Eyre  Peninsula  visited  communities  in  regional  South  Australia  and  Victoria.  Participants  included  people  from  Port  Neill,  Tumby  Bay,  Lock,  Elliston,  Venus  Bay,  Cleve  and  Streaky  Bay.  Mrs  Piip  said  the  focus  of  -the  tour  was  on  tourism,  infrastructure,  community  development,  economic  development,  town  beautification,  industry  and  fundraising.  She  said  community  spirit  and  togetherness  along  with  personal  enthusiasm  were  important  if  small  towns  were  to  survive.  ""A  passion  and  a  vision  by  individual  people  was  evident  as   crucial  ingredients  for  success  in  all  of  the  ventures  that  we  visited  over  the  week-long  tour,""  Mrs  Piip  said.  Mrs  Piip  also  added  that  to  succeed  you  couldn't  do  things  at  half  measure.  ""When  you  do  something  you  have  to  do  it  well,""  she  said.  ""And  you  have  to  do  it  really  well.""  Vice  president  of  the  Port  Neill  Progress  Association  Helen  Cox  said  providing  services  for  the  youth  in  towns  and  keeping  them  in  the  area  was  a  key  priority.  Mrs  Cox  said  a  fulltime  development  officer  in  the  area  would  help  towns  get  back  on  their  feet.  ""The  most  effective  place  was  Donald  in  Victoria  where  they   vival  employed  a  development  officer,""  Mrs  Cox  said.  She  said  the  town  had  a  population  of  around  1200  people  and  the  community  was  thriving.  Donald  boasted  a  shirt  factory,  a  biscuit  factory  and  even  a  Muslim  abattoir.  Mrs  Cox  said  people  were  encouraged  to  build  new  homes  in  the  town  because  of  an  initiative  which  meant  new  home  builders  didn't  have  to  pay  rates  for  three  years.  Mrs  Cox  said  such  initiatives  created  jobs  in  the  towns  and  kept  the  youth  in  the  area.  ""We  need  to  re-educate  people  and  stop  the  leakage  from  our  towns,""  she  said.  ""Changing  people's  attitudes  towards  business  is  important.""  Mrs  Piip  agreed  keeping  youth  in  the  area  was  essential  and  highlighted  one  Victorian  town  as  a  great  example.  ""They  (residents  of  Benalla)  are  really  looking  after  their  youth,""  she  said.  ""This  council  has  an  excellent  vision  for  the  inclusion  of  youth  in  decision  making,  the  development  of  leadership  skills  •  in  the  younger  generation  and  for  the  retention  of  current  businesses.

Employing  an  economic  develop-   ment  officer  was  something  both  Mrs  Piip  and  Mrs  Cox  said  Eyre  Peninsula  towns  needed  to  do.  Mrs  Cox  said  towns  in  the  region  also  needed  to  look  ahead  and  plan  for  the  future.  She  said  creating  a  town  fund  of  some  sort  would  help.  ""Most  towns  are  going  to  have  to  do  this  to  survive,""  she  said. ",2000-07-27
"  JERUSALEM:  The  visit  to  Israel  of  Pope  John  Paul  II  this  week  presents  a  turning-point  in  relations  between  Christians  and  Jews,  Jerusalem  Mayor   Ehud  Olmert  declared.   “This  is  an  opportunity  of  historic  proportions  —  to  open  a  new  chapter  in  the  relations  between  the  Church  and  the  Jewish  people,”  Olmert  said  as  the  Pope  landed  in  Jerusalem.   The  first  Pope  to  visit  Israel  in  36  years,  his  arrival  has  been  anxiously  awaited  by  both  Israelis  and  Palestinians,  each  seeking  to  make  political  and  moral  capital  out  of  his  presence.  The  Vatican,  which  recog  nised  Israel  only  in  1994,  does  not  recognise  its  claims  over  East  Jerusalem,  which  Israel  captured  and   annexed  in  1967.   The  Pope  flew  to  Jerusalem  in  a  Black  Hawk  helicopter  from  Ben  Gurion  Airport.  “Welcome  to  Jerusalem,  the  capital  of  Israel,”  Olmert  greeted  him  in  Hebrew.  Olmert  then  read  a  psalm  about  the  unity  of  Jerusalem  and  presented  him  with  a  special  copy  of  the  Bible.  “He  carries  a  deep  sense  of  responsibility  for  the  relations  between  the  Church  and  the   Jewish  people,”  Olmert  said.   The  Pope  delivered  a  conciliatory  message  on  his  arrival  in  Israel  from  Amman  in  a  Royal  Jordanian  aircraft.  “We  all  know  how  urgent  is  the  need  for  peace  and  justice,  not  for  Israel  alone,  but  for  the  entire  region,”  he  said.  “I  pray  that  my  visit  will  serve  to  encourage  an  increase  of  inter-reli  gious  dialogue  that  will  lead  Jews,  Christians  and  Muslims  to  seek  in  their  respective  beliefs  ...  the  motiva  tion  and  the  perseverance  to  work  for  the  peace  and  justice  which  people  of   the  Holy  Land  do  not  yet  have,  and  for  which  they  yearn  so  deeply.”   The  Pope’s  week-long  millennial  pil  grimage  includes  Jordan,  Israel  and  the  Palestinian  self-rule  areas.   He  was  greeted  on  the  tarmac  at  Ben-Gurion  Airport  by  three  Israeli  children  —  Jewish,  Muslim  and  Christian  —  who  presented  him  with  a  bowl  full  of  earth,  which  he  kissed.  Israeli  President  Ezer  Weizman  and  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  then  met  him,  and  he  was  welcomed  by  the  entire  Israeli  cabinet  and  leading  reli   gious  officials,  while  a  military  band  played  Jerusalem  of  Gold   Shielded  by  umbrellas  from  a  cold  drizzle,  he  noted  the  evolving  ties  between  Israel  and  the  Vatican,  includ  ing  the  1994  establishment  of  diplo  matic  ties.  He  spoke  of  the  “new-found  openness”  between  Jews  and  Christians  and  the  need  to  deepen  interfaith  understanding.   Echoing  his  appeal  earlier  this  week  to  Israel  and  the  Arabs  to  remain  com  mitted  to  the  difficult  search  for  peace,  he  noted  that  the  process   “binds”  all  the  people  of  the  region  to  pursue  a  lasting  peace,  and  said  Christians  and  Jews  must  make  efforts  to  overcome  prejudice.   While  the  Vatican  has  described  the  pilgrimage  as  a  spiritual  journey,  undercurrents  of  other  issues  are  evi  dent.  Noting  that  Israel  was  estab  lished  out  of  the  devastation  of  the  Holocaust,  President  Weizman  wel  comed  the  Pope’s  apology  in  Rome  last  week  for  sins  committed  by  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  against  other  peoples  and  called  for  continued  co  operation  to  fight  antisemitism.  Israel  welcomed  the  apology,  but  expressed  disappointment  that  it  did  not  include  an  explicit  reference  to  the  Holocaust.  Before  the  Pope’s  arrival,  some  Israeli  officials  said  they  believed  a  clear  mention  of  the  Holocaust  would  be  appropriate.   Israel  has  taken  unprecedented  security  measures  for  the  visit,  includ  ing  stationing  thousands  of  police  and  detaining  right-wing  Jewish  extremists  suspected  of  planning  to  disrupt  the  visit.  Israeli  newspapers  were  domi  nated  by  the  visit,  with  Ma’ariv  wel  coming  the  Pope  in  Latin.  AFP,  JTA ",2000-03-24
"  News   Lieberman  vows  to  keep  the  faith   US  ELECTION  November  7,2000   WASHINGTON:  Senator  Joseph  Lieberman  —  who  will  make  history   next  week  if  he  becomes  the  first  Jewish  Vice-President  of  the  United  States  —  wants  America  to  find  its  spiritual  balance.   The  running  mate  of  Democratic  presidential  candidate  A1  Gore,  the  Connecticut  senator  has  frequently  included  religious  references  during  his  campaign,  despite  criticism  from  some  American  Jewish  leaders.   Speaking  in  Indiana  last  week,  he  said  the  country  was  founded  on  val  ues  of  faith,  and  he  did  not  believe  its  Founding  Fathers  wanted  the  strong  separation  of  Church  and  State  as  advocated  by  some  in  his  own  party.   “The  line  of  Church  and  State  has  always  been  hard  to  draw,”  he  said,  “but  in  recent  years  we  have  gone  far  beyond  what  the  framers  imagined  in  separating  the  two.  So  much  so  that   INSIDE   ■  Fighting  for  civil  rights  ■  Congressional  contests   to  watch   PAGE  14   ■  On  the  brink  of  history   PAGE  15   ■  Hillary  in  race  to  be   seen  as  Israelis  friend   PAGE  IS   we  have  practically  banished  religious  values  and  religious  institutions  from  the  public  square.”   When  he  joined  Vice-President  A1  Gore’s  campaign  in  August,  Lieberman  made  headlines  as  the  first  Jew  on  a  major  national  ticket  in  American  history.  But  even  after  the  novelty  wore  off,  he  pursued  religious  issues  in  his  speeches,  evoking  God   and  biblical  verses.  Those  comments   sparked  criticism  from  Jewish  leaders  who  felt  he  was  crossing  the  line  between  Church  and  State.   “Appealing  along  religious  lines,  or  belief  in  God,  is  contrary  to  the   Senator  Joseph  Lteberman  with  his  wife  Hadassah.   American  ideal,”  said  the  Anti  Defamation  League.   Last  week  Lieberman  defended  his   use  of  religious  speech  and  mentioned  those  who  oppose  it.  “Some  friends  and  foes  discouraged  me  from  speak  ing  about  religion,  but  my  resolve  has  been  strengthened.”  Leaders  need  to  find  the  line  between  discussing  faith  in  public  life  and  not  excluding  those  with  differing  viewpoints,  he  said.   Foxman  said  while  he  agrees  with  the  need  to  find  the  role  of  faith  in  politics,  now  is  not  the  time  to  look  for  it.  “It’s  an  important  debate,  but  this  is  a  debate  that  belongs  in  soci  ety,  not  on  the  campaign  trail.  If  you’re  an  atheist,  Muslim  or  a  Buddhist,  you  felt  excluded.”   Matt  Brooks  of  the  Republican  Jewish  Coalition  said  he  found  the  speech  “hypocritical”  because  Democrats  chastise  Republicans  for  speaking  of  God  in  expressing  views  on  abortion.  “This  is  an   unprecedented  call  for  greater  reli  gious  involvement,”  Brooks  said.  “This  is  part  of  a  pattern  among  Democrats  to  use  religion  in   speeches  and  their  public  profes  sion.”   He  cited  a  recent  speech  by  Lieberman  in  which  the  candidate  invoked  the  commandment  to   “Honour  thy  mother  and  father”  as  an  argument  for  Medicare  reform.   Lieberman’s  remarks  last  week  combined  religious  doctrine  with  American  history,  as  he  repeatedly  noted  the  role  which  faith  played  in  the  establishment  of  the  American  Government.  He  cited  George  Washington,  John  Adams  and  Thomas  Jefferson,  noting  their  use  of  God  in  writing  the  Bill  of  Rights  and  Declaration  of  Independence.  “They  knew  that  our  experience  in  self-gov  ernment  was  contingent  on  our  faith  and  trust  in  the  Creator  who  endowed  us  with  the  inalienable  rights  to  life,  liberty  and  the  pursuit  of  happiness,”   Lieberman  said.   Foxman  said  he  believed  Lieberman’s  campaign  team  had  understood  his  (Foxman’s)  concerns.  “He  didn’t  preach,”  he  said  of  Lieberman’s  speech  last  week:  “he   taught.’   JTA ",2000-11-03
"  Broader  guidelines  for  religious  tolerance   CANBERRA   FILE   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   THE  need  of  observant  Jews  to  be  home  in  time  on  Friday  nights  to  cele  brate  Shabbat  has  been  cited  in  recently  issued  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunity  Commission  guidelines  to  illustrate  how  religious  discrimination  can  affect  workers,  even  unintentionally.   The  Commission  has  issued  the  guidelines  defining  direct  and  indirect  religious  discrimination  following  complaints  from  job  seekers  that  reli  gious  organisations  providing  com  munity  services  for  the  Federal  Government  have  discriminated  against  them.   The  guidelines  say  there  can  be  indirect  discrimination  if  an  employer  applies  a  rule,  policy  or  procedure  which  may  seem  to  apply  to  everyone  without  allowing  for  employees  whose  religious  practices  are  different   from  those  of  most  others.   The  guidelines  suggest  that  an  employer  may  attempt  to  impose  an  inflexible  rule  that  no  employee  may  leave  work  before  5pm.  “This  rule,”  the  guidelines  say,  “can  affect  Orthodox  Jews  in  winter  because  they  must  leave  work  with  enough  time  to  get  home  before  sundown  to  observe  the  Sabbath.  Orthodox  Jews  who  are  refused  flexible  scheduling  could  be  forced  to  choose  between  their  reli  gion  and  their  jobs.”   The  guidelines  say  that  unless  a  requirement  is  “reasonable  in  the  cir  cumstances”,  it  is  likely  to  be  indirect  discrimination,  even  if  there  is  no  intention  to  discriminate.   The  guidelines  are  addressed  prin  cipally  to  private  organisations  —  mainly  Christian  religious  organisa  tions  —  which  have  become  promi  nent  employers  following  the  Federal  Government’s  controversial  decision  to  privatise  employment,  welfare  and  other  community  services  previously  provided  by  the  Commonwealth.   The  Commission  says  that  although  religious  organisations  have  agreed  to  comply  with  federal,  state  and  local  government  anti-discrimination  laws  and  requirements,  there  has  been  “a  need  for  greater  clarity  regarding  the  extent  to  which  religious  beliefs  and  values  may  be  taken  into  account  in  employment  within  organisations  that  provide  community  services  on  behalf  of  the  government”.   The  guidelines  “seek  to  assist  employers  avoid  discrimination  while  recognising  that  some  organisations  have  a  religious  ethos  of  which  it  is   reasonable  to  expect  certain  employ  ees  to  have  a  degree  or  knowledge  or  understanding”.   The  Commission  has  invoked  feder  al  laws  prohibiting  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  race,  colour,  sex,  age,  reli  gion,  political  opinion,  national  extrac  tion  or  social  origin.   The  guidelines  rule  out  both  direct  and  indirect  discrimination.  Direct  dis  crimination  excludes  or  reduces  the  chances  of  individuals  or  groups  get  ting  jobs  because  of  “personal  charac  teristics”.  This  includes  religion  or  belief  and  applies  whether  the  dis   crimination  is  conscious  or  uncon   scious.  Harassment  of  employees  because  of  religious  belief  or  non  belief  may  also  amount  to  discrimina  tion  if  they  are  treated  less  favourably  than  other  employees.   The  guidelines  also  emphasise  that  laws  prohibit  advertisements  which  require  job  applicants  to  have  empa   thy  or  sympathy  for  a  particular  faith  s  ethos,  values  and  ideals  or  commit  ment  to  a  faith  or  denomination.   The  laws  also  forbid  job  applica  tions  that  require  job  seekers  to  declare  their  religion,  questions  at  interview  about  an  applicant’s  religion  or  religious  practices  or  a  requirement  for  references  from  ministers  of  reli  gion.  But  advertisements  are  allowed  to  refer  to  the  need  for  understanding  and  willingness  to  work  with  the  reli  gious  employer’s  mission  and  knowl  edge  of  the  philosophy  and  values  of  the  religious  organisation.   The  guidelines  suggest  employers  allow  flexible  hours  and  enable  employees  to  make  up  for  lost  time  observing  holy  days.  Employees  should  also  be  allowed  to  wear  reli  gious  head-coverings  including  yarmulkes,  turbans  (for  Sikhs)  and  hijabs  for  Muslim  women.

"  “Sensational”  media  condemned   Stefan  Bialoguski   A  SILVER  lining  to  the  media’s  cloudy  coverage  of  the  violence  in  Israel  was  noted  by  observers  last  week  —  but  the  cloud  remained.   In  what  has  been  condemned  as  an  “unpro  fessional,  incompetent  and  inflammatory""  report,  Channel  Nine’s  60  Minutes  on  Sunday   concluded  that  the  evidence  was  “incontrovert  ible”  that  the  Israelis  had  murdered  12-year-old  Palestinian  youth  Mohammed  Aldura  at  Netzarim  Junction  and  then  destroyed  the  evi   dence.   Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  exec  utive  director  Dr  Colin  Rubenstein  said  60  Minutes’  Richard  Carleton  had  not  interviewed  any  Israeli  officials  for  his  report.  Nor  had  he  examined  any  contrary  evidence,  such  as  the  aerial  photograph  published  in  last  week’s  Australian  Jewish  News  showing  how  the  boy  and  his  father  were  caught  in  a  crossfire  between  Palestinians  and  Israeli  soldiers.   Dr  Rubenstein  said  AUAC  was  considering  what  action  to  take.  “It  was  the  sensational  non  sense  we  have  come  to  expect  from  Richard  Carleton.  It  took  the  cake  for  one-sidedness.”   He  also  condemned  SBS  TV  for  broadcasting  a  “scurrilous”  BBC  report  from  Florida  purport  ing  to  show  that  Jewish  money  was  determining  America’s  Middle  East  policies.  “That  it  was  shown  on  multicultural  television  rubs  salt  into  the  wound,”  he  added.   The  above  poster  was  on  display  at  the  University  of  New  South  Wales  last  week.  It  was  authorised  by  Every-Action  —  Activism  Committed  to   Exposing  Corruption  &amp;  Abuses  of  Human  Rights  by  Governmental  Agencies.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  research  offi  cer  Aviva  Bard  said  she  had  received  a  com   plaint  describing  the  report  as  “nauseating  and   WORSHIPPING  THEIR  GOD...   Jewish  and  Arab  groups  in  America  have  condemned  this  cartoon  in  the  Los  Angeles  Times  depicting  a  Muslim  and  Jew  praying  at  what  appears  to  be  the  Western  Wall,  with  the  wall  featuring  the  word  “HATE”.  “It  is  the  most  grotesque  insult  to  Judaism,”  Anti-Defamation  League  director  Abraham  Foxman  said.  Cartoonist  Michael  Ramirez  said  the  wall  is  not  the  Western  Wall,  but  “an  unspecified   wall  of  hate”.   mediaeval”.  “There  was  no  mention  of  the  influ  ence  of  Arab  oil  production,”  she  said.   Israeli  Foreign  Ministry  spokesman  Gideon  Meir  told  the  Jerusalem  Post  that  hundreds  of  complaints  had  been  received  from  around  the  world  concerning  CNN’s  coverage  and  about  antisemitic  features  in  the  BBC  World  Service  coverage.  In  particular,  Israel  had  objected  to  CNN  about  its  two  Arab  women  reporting  from  the  field,  using  the  word  “we”  “as  if  CNN  had  become  an  agent  of  the  Palestinians”.   Columnist  Robert  Macklin  attributed  the  crisis  to  Israelis’  struggle  to  come   to  grips  with  the  Holocaust,  which  he  charged  had  been  made  into  a   religion.   Mr  Meir:  “We’re  not  asking  that  CNN  become  an  agent  of  the  Israeli  Government;  what  we’re  asking  is  to  be  honest  and  even-handed  ...  We  have  no  problem  with  the  other  side  presenting  its  story.  The  problem  is  that  the  other  side  is  presenting  its  story  with  lies,  and  the  media  gives  them  an  advantage  by  covering  their  side  of  the  story.”   The  quest  for  balance  also  does  not  seem  high  on  the  agenda  for  Palestinian  Authority  Television,  which  broadcast  live  a  sermon  by  Dr  Ahmad  Abu  Halabiya  of  the  PA-appointed  Fatwa  Council  and  former  acting  rector  of  the  Islamic  University  in  Gaza.  The  Middle  East  Media  Research  Institute  translated  his  sermon:  “Our  bride  is  paradise  ...  The  cost  and  the  dowry  of  this  bride,  the  dowry  of  this  paradise  is  that  we  fight  in  the  path  of  Allah,  and  kill  and  be  killed...   Have  no  mercy  on  the  Jews,  no  matter  where  they  are,  in  any  country.  Fight  them,  wherever  you  are.  Wherever  you  meet  them,  kill  them.  Wherever  you  are,  kill  those  Jews  and  those  Americans  who  are  like  them  and  those  who  stand  by  them,  they  are  all  in  one  trench,  against  the  Arabs  and  the  Muslims.”   In  Sydney,  Arab  activist  Khaldoun  Hajaj,  described  in  the  Sun-Herald  as  a  fierce  advocate  for  the  Palestinian  people,  is  an  explicit  sup  porter  of  terrorism,  as  reported  by  the  AJN  last   week.  He  accused  Israel  of  deliberately  provok  ing  the  latest  violence  and  claimed  that  his  fam  ily  had  lived  in  the  Galilee  “for  at  least  4000  years"".   A  balancing  interview  with  Zionist  Federation  of  Australia  president  Dr  Ron  Weiser  was  print  ed  alongside.  Dr  Weiser,  referring  to  Ariel  Sharon’s  controversial  visit  to  the  Temple  Mount,  asked:  “What  sort  of  peace  is  it  if  a  Jew  within  Israel  can’t  visit  the  nation’s  holiest  site?”   The  religious  significance  of  the  Temple  Mount  still  eludes  many  journalists.  John  Diamond  in  the  Sunday  Telegraph  referred  to  “the  site  of  the  A1  Aqsa  Mosque,  third-holiest  site  in  Islam”.  In  the  next  paragraph  he  referred  to  “the  Western  Wall,  Judaism’s  holiest  site”.   Rabbi  Moshe  Gutnick:  “The  holiest  site  in  Judaism  is  actually  the  site  of  the  A1  Aqsa   Mosque.  It  was  where  the  Holy  of  Holies  of  the  Temple  was  located,  about  1600  years  before  the  A1  Aqsa  Mosque  was  built.”   However,  even  Mr  Diamond’s  report  sparkled  in  comparison  to  other  reports.   Channel  10  news  referred  to  the  outbreak  of  violence  “in  Palestine”,  following  a  “provocative  visit  [by  Ariel  Sharon]  to  a  Muslim  holy  site”.  In  an  otherwise-balanced  report,  SBS  TV  also  referred  to  Sharon’s  visit  to  “Islam’s  third-holiest  site”  without  mentioning  its  significance  to   Jews.   AUAC  director  of  international  affairs  Jeremy  Jones  said  there  had  been  some  improvement  in  last  week’s  coverage  compared  with  the  week  before,  which  had  treated  the  situation  as  “a  matter  of  a  ‘bloodthirsty’  or  ‘savage’  Israeli  Government  going  out  to  harm  Palestinians”.   Ms  Bard  agreed:  “In  the  last  couple  of  days,  1  have  noticed  that  [the  media]  are  considering  the  Israeli  perspective;  while  in  no  way  is  it  an  even  coverage,  they  are  presenting  more  of  an  Israeli  perspective  than  they  have  done.”   A  diary  entry  by  James  Jeffrey  in  the  Weekend  Australian  caused  consternation.  He  wrote:  “Amazing  developments  this  week  in  Jerusalem  where  even  a  two-year-old  child  is  now  consid  ered  suitable  for  target  practice.  Get  'em  early  seems  to  be  the  ethos  at  work  in  the  Israeli  Army  these  days  —  after  all,  you  can  never  be  sure  what  sort  of  troublemakers  those  Palestinian  toddlers  will  grow  up  to  be.”   Mr  Jones:  “I  know  from  the  questions  I  have  been  asked  this  past  week  that  there’s  more  of  an  understanding  that  people  who  throw  rocks,  shoot  bullets  and  throw  petrol-bombs  don’t  fall  into  the  category  of  protesters.  But  there’s  still  a  disturbing  lack  of  context  in  the  coverage.”   The  main  news  last  Friday  was  the  murder  of  two  Israeli  reservists  by  a  mob  in  Ramallah.  The  West  Australian  placed  the  story  under  the  headline  “Middle  East  on  brink  as  soldiers  lynched”.  But  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald's  front  page  story  opened  with  Israeli  helicopters’  rocketing  the  police  station  where  the  murders  took  place,  rather  than  the  murders  them   selves.   The  Australian  relegated  the  lynching  to  third  place  after  the  killing  of  American  sailors  in  Aden  and  the  bombing  of  Yasser  Arafat’s  office  in  Gaza.  The  Canberra  Times  missed  the  news   altogether.  News  editor  Bruce  Jones  said  the  news  of  the  lynching  started  to  come  through  “in  dribs  and  drabs”  mid-evening  Thursday,  and  its  “full  import”  had  not  become  apparent  by  the  time  the  newspaper  went  to  press.  He  said  it  gave  the  story  front-page  treatment  on  Saturday.   In  the  same  edition,  Canberra  Times  colum  nist  Robert  Macklin  attributed  the  crisis  to   Israelis’  struggle  to  come  to  grips  with  the  Holocaust,  which  he  charged  had  been  made  into  a  religion.  Just  as  the  Nazis  had  dehuman  ised  the  Jews,  so,  claims  Mr  Macklin,  do  the  Israelis  “make  lesser  beings  of  the  Palestinians”.   “[The  Israelis]  do  not  understand  that  in  their  rage  over  the  Holocaust,  they  are  adopting  many  of  the  attributes  of  their  erstwhile  oppres  sors  ...  Arafat  and  his  ilk  are  not  negotiating  with  men  and  women  of  goodwill  seeking  some  accommodation  to  bring  permanent  happiness  to  all.  They  are  wrestling  with  the  ghosts  of  the   Holocaust.” ",2000-10-20
"  Title:   Gesher:  The  Official  Journal  of  the  Council   of  Christians  &amp;  Jews  (Vic)  Inc.   Editor;   Gad  Ben-Meir   Date:  Vol.  2,  No.  2,  October  1999   Reviewer:  Ruth  Rosenberg   HAVING  read  issues  of  Gesher,  the  journal  of  the   Victorian  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews,  with  mod  erate  interest,  I  was  stunned  by  the  power  of  some  of  the  articles  in  this  edition.  It  includes  contributions  by  many  names  familiar  to  the  community:  Monash  University  Law  Professor  Louis  Waller,  writer  and  former  Australian  Jewish  News  literary  editor  Dr  Serge  Liberman  and  Mount  Scopus  College  educational  research  and  development  director  Paul  Forgasz.   But  opened  at  random,  the  first  article  to  grip  my  atten  tion  was  “The  Conversion  as  Connivance”  by  Reverend  Dr  Lorraine  Parkinson.  She  discusses  Hebrew  writer  Aharon  Appelfeld’s  book,  The  Conversion,  which  deals  with  a  fasci  nating  period  of  Jewish  history  when  Jews  in  Germany  were  enticed  by  promised  career  advancement  to  convert  to  Christianity.   According  to  some  sources,  the  peculiar  pain  suffered  by  Rhineland  Jews  like  Karl  Marx’s  father  was  that  they  were  first  given  civil  rights  under  Napoleonic  rule,  only  to  have  them  stripped  again  when  the  French  retreaded.  Having  once  been  free  to  practise  the  professions,  they  were  sud  denly  barred  from  doing  so  —  but  not  if  they  were  to  con   vert.   Appelfeld’s  book  describes  the  subtle  pain  of  one  man’s  conversion  for  the  sake  of  expediency  and  its  careful  encouragement  by  the  priest  who  will  baptise  him.  Eventually  the  apostate  returns  to  his  people  and  suffers  a  harsh  fate,  but  with  the  reward  of  being  true  to  himself.   Parkinson  comments  poignantly:  “For  the  Christian  read  er,  there  is  no  escaping  the  increasingly  uncomfortable  truth  the  story  carries.  Whereas  it  is  disturbing  enough  for  a  Christian  to  admit  the  manner  in  which  the  Church  par  ticipated  in  the  development  of  antisemitic  hatred  through  the  ages,  this  book  also  demands  an  explanation  concern   ing  the  shameful  way  the  sacred  sacrament  of  baptism  was  used  in  an  attempt  to  destroy  the  faith  of  Jesus’  own  peo   ple.”   Long-time  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  leader  Reverend  Robert  Anderson  contributes  a  courageous  statement  of  belief,  explaining  how  his  respect  for  the  Hebrew  Bible  grew  from  his  days  at  Edinburgh  University  in  the  1950s,  enabling  him  to  develop  an  understanding  of  Judaism,  despite  exposure  to  antisemitic  and  even  pro  Nazi  Christian  theology.   Another  outstanding  article,  for  which  I  recommend  the  journal,  is  Melbourne  Jewish  History  Professor  Eliezer  Paltiel’s  analysis  of  “Jewish  self-understanding  in  the  early  centuries  of  the  Common  Era”.  Peppered  with  startling  facts  and  conclusions  gleaned  from  Greek  sources  and  archaeological  finds,  Paltiel’s  comments  are  incisive  and  authoritative.   Acknowledging  the  criticism  that  rabbinic  Judaism  was  narrower  in  its  outlook  after  the  destruction  of  the  Temple,  he  remarks:  “Authoritarianism  seems  to  have  been  the  bit  ter  pill  that  saved  the  life  of  the  patient”.  To  those  who  dis  parage  Halacha  as  promoting  a  rigid  way  of  life,  he  com  ments,  “ideologies  and  purely  inner  personal  religious  experiences  can  hardly  be  national.  They  are  not  social,  they  are  individual.  If  you  want  to  have  a  religion  that  unites  a  nation,  it  has  to  consist  of  practices.  Practices  make  an  ethnic  culture.”   Other  highlights  include  Gad  Ben-Meir’s  editorial  on  Adolf  Eichmann,  whose  trial  he  attended  in  Israel  in  1961;  an  article  on  Muslim  attitudes  to  Judaism  and  Christianity  by  New  Zealand  academic  Dr  William  Shepard,  who  sug  gests  the  possibility  of  a  “trialogue”;  and  an  overview  of  the  Dead  Sea  Scrolls  by  New  York  University  Hebrew  and  Judaic  Studies  Professor  Lawrence  Schiffman.  Meanwhile,  Paul  Forgasz  urges  those  trying  to  understand  Judaism  not  to  forget  that  the  Oral  and  Written  Torah  have  always  been  inter-related,  and  Catholic  playwright  Dr  Jack  Opie  defends  Chaucer  from  a  charge  of  antisemitism.   Ruth  Rosenberg  is  a  Melbourne  reviewer. ",2000-03-17
"  Books   Understanding  violence  in  Israel   Tide:   Brother  against  Brother:   Violence  and  Extremism  in   Israeli  Politics  from  Altalena  to  the  Rabin  Assassination   Author:  Ehud  Sprinzak   Publisher:  The  Free  Press,  370pp,  $59.95   Reviewer:  Ben  Haneman   VOID  rose-coloured  glasses  when  reading  Ehud  Sprinzak’s  detailed  and   JL  3k  well-researched  work,  Brother  Against  Brother.  Here  is  a  different  history  of  the  State  of  Israel,  a  history  about  which  you  may  have  heard  rumours,  of  which  you  were  only  indistinctly  aware,  and  may  possibly   not  want  to  know.   Nevertheless,  the  author’s  conclusions  are  optimistic.  Violence  there  is,  and  much  to  be  deplored  and  regretted,  yet,  even  that  violence  is  within  bounds  and  Jewish  ethics  have  lessened  its  impact.  Not  completely,  however,  as  shown  by  the  murder  of  peace  activist  Emil  Grunzweig  and  the  murder  of  29  Muslims  in  Hebron  by  Dr  Baruch  Goldstein,  culminating  in  Yigal  Amir’s  tragic   assassination  of  Prime  Minister  Yitzhak  Rabin.   In  a  dispassionate,  clinical,  witness-on  oath  type  of  way,  Sprinzak  takes  us  through  the  events,  explaining  plainly  and  convinc  ingly  the  motivation  of  those  who  practise  violence,  and  describing  both  the  perpetra   tors  and  their  victims.   It  would  be  easy  to  dismiss  both  Goldstein  and  Amir  as  having  acted  psycho  pathically.  It  is  not  as  simple  as  that.  We  all  know  that  there  are  at  least  two  Israels,  and  the  battle  raging  in  the  broadest  terms  con  cerns  whether  the  land  should  be  governed  by  the  Torah  and  its  interpretations,  or  by  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations,  and  by  implication,  democracy.   Interestingly,  those  from  the  ultra-reli  gious  camp  who  were  contemplating  vio  lence  would  wait  for  rabbinical  “blessing”   for  their  actions.  There  has  been  consider  able  debate  as  to  whether  Rabin’s  murder  had  explicit  rabbinical  approval,  but  there  is  no  doubt  that  inflammatory,  indeed  murder  ous,  language  was  freely  used.  Certainly,  violence  against  Palestinians  has  been  sanc  tioned.  In  all  candour,  it  can  be  seen  that  without  in  any  way  excusing  Arab  terrorism,  there  was  intentional  and  grievous  provoca  tion  from  the  settlers  of  Gush  Emunim  (Bloc  of  the  Faithful),  for  instance.   Sprinzak  quotes  Lubavitch  Rabbi  Yitzhak  Ginzburg,  who  justifies,  if  not  extols,  the  murders  committed  by  Goldstein  and  states  that  it  is  fully  justified  to  kill  non-combatant  Palestinians.  We  are  left  with  the  impression  that  God  has  often  blessed  our  people  with  wise  and  saintly  rabbis,  but  sometimes  He  decides  not  to  bless  us!   The  career  of  Rabbi  Meir  Kahane  in  America  and  Israel  is  covered  in  detail,  until  it  was  ended  by  a  Muslim  fundamentalist.  Kahane  saw  secular  Jews  as  much  the  enemy  as  Palestinians.  Indeed,  in  an  analogy  with  Maccabean  times,  the  enemy  is  described  as  “Hellenised  Jews”.   Sprinzak,  Professor  of  Political  Science  at  the  Hebrew  University  of  Jerusalem,  does  well  as  a  historian  and  a  sociologist,  but  risks  his  reputation  when  he  sets  out  to  be  a  prophet.  His  book  was  completed  two  years  ago,  and  he  did  not  foresee  Ehud  Barak’s  victory.  Moreover,  some  of  his  predictions  seem  unlikely,  and  stand  a  strong  chance  of  being  proved  wrong.  But  he  does  document  a  thread  of  political  violence  in  Israeli  poli  tics  and  offers  a  useful  taxonomy  of  types  of  violence.  I  was  surprised  to  find  a  whole  chapter  devoted  to  ultra-Orthodox  violence.  There  is  also  a  useful  discussion  on  what  happens  when  a  messianic  movement  finds  its  expectations  nullified.  Sprinzak  quotes  Leon  Festinger,  author  of  When  Prophecy  Fails,  who  studies  how  followers  overcome  “the  painful  cognitive  dissonance  of  discom   firmation”  —  in  other  words,  “the  painful  realisation  that  they’ve  backed  the  wrong  messianic  horse”.  We  are  told  that  they  cope  in  three  ways:  by  finding  a  biblical  explanation  for  the  disappointing  turn  of  events;  turning  to  passivism;  or  turning  to  hyperactive  religiosity,  including  terroristic   suicide.   Brother  Against  Brother  is  a  sombre,  thought-provoking  book  with  which  we  don’t  have  to  agree.  But  we  should  hear  what  is  being  said.

"  Worldwide  wave  of  antisemitic  violence   ROME:  Fearing  that  the  crisis  in  the  Middle  East  could  spill  over  into  a  wave  of  terrorism  in  Europe  and  the  United  States,  Jewish  communi  ties  and  police  are  on  their  highest  state  of  alert   in  a  decade.   Scores  of  antisemitic  incidents  ranging  from  graffiti  to  street  demonstrations  to  the  firebomb  ing  of  synagogues  and  Jewish  businesses  have  been  reported  in  Paris,  Rome,  Madrid,  Cape  Town,  Moscow,  London,  Argentina,  Germany  and  the  United  States.   An  Orthodox  Jew  in  his  20s  is  in  a  serious  con  dition  after  being  stabbed  17  times  on  a  London  bus  this  week.  A  man  “of  Mediterranean  appear  ance”  is  in  custody.  A  spokesman  for  a  Jewish  group  said  the  threat  was  the  most  serious  since   the  1991  Gulf  War.   Almost  100  incidents  were  reported  in  France,  including  the  fire-bombing  of  a  Paris  synagogue  and  a  Jewish  shop  in  Toulon,  and  similar  attacks   on  several  other  Jewish  institutions  including  a  school.  French  President  Jacques  Chirac  called  the  attacks  “intolerable”.   Between  Rosh  Hashana  and  Yom  Kippur,  about  50  incidents  ranging  from  vandalism  to  antisemitic  graffiti  were  reported  at  British  syna  gogues.  Militant  Muslim  demonstrators  in  London,  Manchester  and  Birmingham  burned  Israeli  flags,  chanted  slogans  and  distributed  leaflets  urging  supporters  to  “kill  Jews  all  over   the  world”.   Germany  has  also  seen  a  wave  of  attacks  on  Jewish  sites,  most  attributed  to  neo-Nazi  skin  heads.  Just  before  Yom  Kippur,  about  100  Palestinian  and  Lebanese  demonstrators  tried  to  storm  the  Old  Synagogue  in  Essen  —  a  Jewish  museum  and  Holocaust  centre.  Foreign  Minister  Joschka  Fischer  condemned  the  attack  and  said  German  authorities  would  not  permit  Jewish  institutions  in  Germany  to  be  targets  of  such  vio   lence.   In  Italy,  target  of  a  number  of  Arab  terrorist  attacks  in  the  1970s  and  ‘80s,  security  was  bol  stered  at  synagogues,  embassies,  airports  and  Jewish  and  foreign  schools.  Milan  Police  Chief  Giovanni  Finazzo  said  that  American  and  Israeli   consulates,  as  well  as  “other  potential  targets”,  were  under  24-hour  guard.   Clashes  have  been  reported  in  Rome  between  young  Jewish  militants  and  right-wing  extremists  demonstrating  in  favour  of  Palestinians.  Italian  Jewish  leaders  blasted  what  they  said  was  one  sided  media  coverage  that  cast  blame  for  the  cri  sis  on  Israel  and  inflamed  antisemitic  feelings.   In  other  incidents:   ES  Local  Jewish  leaders  criticised  South  Africa’s  ruling  party  for  organising  a  Palestinian  solidari  ty  rally  in  Cape  Town.  The  South  African  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  planned  to  meet  with  officials  from  the  African  National  Congress  to  discuss  the  ruling  party’s  “behaviour,  or  rather  misbe  haviour”,  according  to  the  board’s  national  chair  man,  Russell  Gaddin.   B3  Rocks  were  thrown  at  a  Jewish  community  building  and  synagogue  in  Madrid,  breaking  win  dows.  No-one  was  injured.   G3  About  100  Arab  students  demonstrated  in  front  of  the  Israeli  Embassy  in  Moscow,  and  an  anonymous  caller  threatened  to  bomb  the  Chabad  synagogue.  Police  evacuated  the  build  ing  but  nothing  was  found.   13  Argentine  officials  strengthened  the  police  presence  near  Jewish  and  Arab  institutions.  Security  was  also  beefed  up  at  the  US  Embassy  and  at  border  crossings.  Argentine  President  Fernando  de  la  Rua  also  convened  the  heads  of  the  security  forces  and  met  with  Jewish  and  Arab  community  leaders,  who  had  written  a  joint  statement  calling  for  a  cease-fire  in  the  Gaza  Strip   and  West  Bank.   In  the  US,  60  federal  agents  are  investigating  a  fire  which  seriously  damaged  Temple  Beth  El  in  Syracuse,  while  in  Chicago,  police  are  investigat  ing  three  attacks  in  a  largely  Jewish  neighbour  hood.  Three  Palestinian  American  teenagers  were  arrested.  Police  are  also  searching  for  a  gunman  who  fired  five  shots  at  a  rabbi  in  his  car,  shattering  the  front  and  rear  windows,  but  miss  ing  the  rabbi.   The  incidents,  in  addition  to  earlier  attacks  on  synagogues  in  Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania,  New  York  and  Toronto,  have  heightened  concern.   European  Jewish  communities  have  height  ened  their  own  security  while  governments  and  police  have  increased  protection  at  Jewish  insti  tutions  and  other  potential  targets.

Het  waren  er  zoveel  dat  ik  drie  maanden  longer  in  het  Nederlanse  leger  heb  gediend  dan  nodig  was,  omdat  ik  mij  weinig  van  demilitaire  tucht  aantrok.  Lang  haar,  baardje,  geen  vouw  in  de  broek,  vergeet  eens  een  officier  te  groeten  (hand  niet  naar  hetpetje),  geenpetje,  laat  in  de  kazerne  (kruipend  onder  het  hek  gevonden)  en  nachtenafwezig.  Oefeningen  waren  leuk.  Je  werd  op  een  vrachtwagen  gezet  en  50  kilometer  later  ergens  afgeladen.  Mijn  maatje,  Jan  Keyzer  en  ik  kwamen  niet  verder  dan  het  eerste  kroegje.  Een  paar  biertjes  en  rond  12  uur  kwam  het  leger  ons  wel  ophalen.  Weer  een  toespraak  van  de  kolonel  en  weer  een  dagje  op  een  eenzame  kamer.  Bob  Dylan  was  mijn  vriend.

Ik  zwaaide  afin  Utrecht  in  juni.  Injuli  werd  ik  21  en  in  augustus  was  ik  op  weg  naar  Australie.  Vandaag  lees  ik  nare  krantenkoppen  in  Australische  kranten.  'DutckUN  troops  'ignored  Muslim  pleas  for  help',  'Desperate  Muslims  'ignored  by  Dutch  ',  Dutch  ignored  pleas  for  help  '  en  mijn  hart  gaat  uit  naar  het  leed.  Voor  hetHaags  Vredesgerecht  staat  nu  een  Servische  massa-moordenaar  Radislav  Krstic.  Zijn  terechtzitting  begon  op  13  maart.  Zijn  troepen  en  zijn  blaaspijpjes  zouden  7500  Bosnische  Moslims  gedood  hebben  in  Srebrenica  op  Wjuli  1995,  en  Hollandse  (NAVO)  troepen  hebben  niets  gedaan  om  het  geweld  te  stoppen.  Een  getuige  zegt,  'Ik  zag  de  Nederlandse  comman  dant  (Ton  Karremans).  Hij  kon  de  wanhoop  van  de  bevolking  niet  verstaanbaar  maken.  '  Wij  zijn  hier  ver  weg  van  de  wanhoop.  Wat  ik  van  de  ellende  begrepen  heb,  en  misschien  dat  iemand  mij  dat  meer  kan  verduidelijken  (er  zijn  lezers  die  graag  toelichtende  brieven  willen  schrijven),  was  het  de  Nederlandse  soldaten  verboden  in  te  grijpen.  NAVO  wilde  geen  conflict.  Er  waren  Nederlandse  soldaten  die  hun  geweren  wilden  gebruiken,  maar  dat  niet  mochten.  Zulk  geweld  zou  een  groter  conflict  teweeg  hebben  gebracht.  Dus  werden  de  Bosnische  mannen  en  vrouwen,  ouderen  en  kinderen  naar  hun  dood  gereden  en  omgebracht,  terwijl  de  Nederlandse  landmacht  de  moorden  met  lede  ogen  aan  moest  zien.  Dat,  voorzover,  heb  ik  nog  niet  in  Den  Haag  gehoord.  Maar  misschien  komt  dat  nog  wel.  De  boat  en  het  geweld  dat  zich  op  de  Balkans  afspeelt,  toen  en  nog  steeds  in  Kosovo,  hebben  geen  plaats  in  het  moderne  Europa.  Het  is  wel  een  voorbeeldvan  de  universele  haat  in  de  wereld,  waarvan  wij  hier  weinig  meemaken,  horen  of  zien.  Het  Australische  leger  in  Oost  Timor  kwam  dicht  bij  zo'n  waarheid.  Maar  thuis,  hier  in  Australie  of  in  Nederland,  heeft  de  gewone  burger  weinig  benul  wat  zich  op  zo  'n  tragisch  moment  plaatsvindt  of  afspeelt.  Ik  vind  het  verschrikkelijk.  Mijn  blaaspijltjes  waren  een  onschuldig  spel  eritegelijk  ook  niet.  Maar  ik  heb  nooit  een  geweer  op  iemand  gericht.  Ik  zal  dat  ook  nooit  doen  en  zou  het  niet  willen  (doen).  Maar  ik  ben  nooit  in  die  positie  geplaatst.  Het  is  bij  de  pijltjes  gebleven  ende  ongevouwen  broeken.  Als  dat  nou  ook  maar  voor  die  jongens  in  Bosnie  had  gekund  dan  zouden  de  krantenkoppen  er  anders  hebben  uitgezien.  Wel  dezelfde  boodschap,  maar  een  andere  vredestroep,  een  andere  nationaliteit,  net  zo  on  machtig  6m  de  smeekbeden  te  kunneribeantwoorden.  Laten  we  niet  vergeten  dat  Krstic  voor  het  gerecht  staat  en  niet  Jan  Soldaat. ",2000-04-10
"  Tension  mounts  over  Temple  Mount  site   Etgar  Lefkovits   JERUSALEM:  Police  closed  the  Temple  Mount  to  Jews  and  tourists  after  hundreds  of  Palestinian  youths,  led  by  PLO  Jerusalem  rep  resentative  Faisal  Husseini  and  MK  Ahmed  Tibi,  reportedly  hurled  insults  at  members  of  the  Temple  Mount  Faithful.   Jerusalem  police  chief  Commander  Yair  Yitzhaki  closed  the  Mount  to  visitors  out  of  fear  the  verbal  slurs  would  flare  into  physical  violence  on  Tisha  b’Av,  the  day  that  commem  orates  the  destruction  of  the  First  and  Second  Temples.   As  several  Temple  Mount  Faithful  activists,  led  by  movement  head  Gershon  Salomon,  reached  the  Mugrabi  Gate  under  police  escort,  the  Palestinians  met  them  with  chants  of  “God  is  great”  and  “With  blood  and  sweat  we’ll  redeem  you,  Palestine.”  The  Jewish  group  responded  with  its  own  chants.   “Today  the  true  battle  on  the  Temple  Mount  begins,”  Salomon  said.  “Enemies  of  the  Temple  Mount...  will  disappear  like  dust  in  the  wind.”   Husseini:  “Some  extreme  Israelis  who  mix  religion  and  politics  are  trying  to  enter  this  place,  so  we  are  here  to  prevent  that,  if  the  police  do  not.  They  know  very  well  that  if  they  make  such  a  move,  it  is  the  end  of  any  hope  for  peace  in  the  Middle  East.”   Yitzhaki  explained  to  leaders  of  the  Muslim  Waqf  religious  trust  that  if  they  did  not  allow  members  of  the  Temple  Mount  Faithful  to  ascend  the  Mount  during  normal  visiting  hours,  then  the  site  would  remain  closed  to  all   tourists.   When  it  appeared  the  Wakf  would  not  allow  the  group’s  members  to  enter  the  site,  the  police  closed  the  Mount  to  non-Muslims.  It  did  not  re-open  until  Sunday.   To  some  Israelis,  the  fact  that  the  Temple  Mount  became  off-limits  to  Jews  on  Tisha  b’Av  was  especially  symbolic  and  poignant.   “One  can  imagine  the  outcry  of  the  Arabs  if  the  Israel  police  would  have  declared  the  Temple  Mount  off  limits  to  Muslims  during  their  holy  month  of  Ramadan,”  said  Esther  Alexander,  who  had  come  to  say  a  prayer  at  the  Kotel.   Earlier,  the  Temple  Mount  Faithful  failed  to  persuade  Israel’s  High  Court  to  stop  construc  tion  by  the  Waqf  on  the  site.  The  group  argued  that  the  Waqf  was  illegally  laying  paving  tiles  across  the  southern  section  of  the  Temple  Mount,  destroying  Jewish  archeological  remains  in  the  process.  They  also  cited  reports  that  the  Waqf  was  intending  to  build  another  mosque  on  the  site.   Another  petition  —  not  presented  by  the  group  —  called  for  the  demolition  of  two  struc  tures  erected  by  the  Waqf  on  the  site.   Both  petitions  were  rejected  by  the  court,  which  accepted  the  State’s  argument  that  it  was  not  the  kind  of  “special  case”  that  called  for  its  intervention  based  on  earlier  rulings.   The  Jerusalem  municipality  told  Ha’aretz   Off  limits  to  Jews...  peace  hopes  focus  increasingly  on  Judaism’s  holiest  site.   that  ongoing  violations  ot  the  planning  and  building  laws  were  occurring  on  the  Temple  Mount,  but  that  it  could  not  enforce  the  law  because  it  was  subject  to  the  guidelines  of  the  Attorney-General.   Meanwhile,  Israel’s  Chief  Rabbinical  Council  has  postponed  a  debate  on  a  proposal  to  build  a  synagogue  on  the  Temple  Mount.   Instead,  the  council,  which  is  the  top  policy  making  body  for  Israel’s  Orthodox  establish  ment,  appointed  a  special  committee  to  study   the  matter.   In  an  indication  of  how  charged  the  propos  al  is,  the  grand  Mufti  of  Jerusalem,  the  senior  Islamic  official  there,  warned  that  building  the  synagogue  would  start  a  war  “that  only  God  knows  where  it  would  lead”.   The  site  of  the  First  and  Second  Temples,  the  Temple  Mount  is  now  where  the  Al-Aksa  Mosque  find  Dome  of  the  Rock  are  located.  It  is  regarded  as  the  third  holiest  site  in  Islam.   The  synagogue  proposal  was  made  by  the  chief  rabbi  of  Haifa,  Sha’ar  Yishuv  Cohen,  a  longtime  supporter  of  letting  Jews  pray  at  the  Temple  Mount.   He  is  reported  to  have  evidence  that  a  syna  gogue  existed  there  following  the  destruction  of  the  Temples.   However,  the  Chief  Rabbinical  Council  said  it  still  supported  a  religious  ruling  barring  Jews  from  entering  the  Temple  Mount.   Since  the  exact  location  of  the  original  Temples  is  not  known,  the  ruling  was  issued  because  of  biblical  injunctions  about  maintain   ing  ritual  nuritv  when  entering  the  holy  site   JTA,  Jerusalem  Post ",2000-08-18
"  MOSCOW:  Just  days  before  the  Russian  presidential  election,  the  state-controlled  television  channel  ran   an  advertisement  claiming  that  one  of  the  candidates  was  controlled  by  Jews,  foreigners  and  gays.   The  attack  against  Grigory  Yavlinsky,  who  has  Jewish  roots,  came  as  a  surprise  because  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin,  who  won  the  election  with  52  percent  of  the  vote,  had  not  played  a  nationalist  card.  If  anything,  it  was  the  campaign  of  Putin’s  main  rival,  Communist  leader  Gennady  Zyuganov,  that  was  tainted   with  antisemitism.   There  have  been  two  Putins  so  far:  the  man  who,  after  being  designated  heir-apparent  by  President  Boris  Yeltsin,  promised  US  President  Bill  Clinton  and  British  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  that  he  would  pursue  free  market  reforms  and  human  rights,  and  the  former  KGB  officer  who  has  pur  sued  the  war  in  Chechnya  with  vengeance  and  not  permitted  journal   ists  to  cover  the  war  against  Muslim  separatists.   This  vagueness  allowed  Jewish  vot  ers,  like  their  fellow  Russians,  to  proj  ect  onto  Putin  whatever  they  wanted:  a  Moscow  businessman  expects  liber  alisation  of  the  economy;  a  family  of  Mountain  Jews,  fleeing  the  instability  in  Dagestan,  wants  him  to  wipe  out  the  rebels  in  Chechnya;  an  activist  from  the  Siberian  city  of  Tomsk  wants  him  to  support  Israel;  a  student  from  Moscow  wants  him  to  crack  down  on  antisemitism.   All  share  a  desire  for  stability,  a  leader  who  will  restore  order  and  authority  of  the  state,  even  at  the  expense  of  some  democracy.  How  this  will  translate  is  unknown.  Will  Putin  pursue  free-market  reforms  and  crack  down  on  antisemitism  or  will  he  become  an  authoritarian  leader  who  allows  free-market  reforms,  but  limits  individual  freedoms  and  pays  scant  attention  to  human  rights?   Will  he,  as  he  did  in  parliament,   Russian   President  Vladimir  Putin   Photo:  AAP/AP   form  an  alliance  with  Communists  and  their  leader,  Zyuganov,  who  received  30  percent  of  the  vote,  or  rely  on  reformers  who  backed  him  in  the  elec  tion,  such  as  former  Prime  Minister  Sergei  Kiriyenko?  Answers  to  the  questions  might  be  clearer  when  Putin  announces  his  government  in  May.   The  antisemitic  advertisement  demonstrates  that  there  may  be  two  Putins  regarding  Jewish  issues  as  well.  Since  Yeltsin  plucked  Putin  from   obscurity  and  made  him  Prime  Minister  last  August  —  and  Acting  President  on  December  31  —  Putin   has  often  stated  a  willingness  to  com  bat  antisemitism  and  xenophobia.  In  November  he  met  Russian  Jewish  leaders.  More  recently,  he  pledged  to  combat  antisemitism  in  a  response  to  a  letter  from  US  legislators.   Even  though  it  was  clear  that  Yavlinsky,  who  garnered  less  than  6  percent,  had  no  chance  of  winning  the   election,  the  advertisement  was  vicious.  Yavlinsky  was  accused  of  hav  ing  spent  10  times  as  much  money  on  his  campaign  as  was  legally  permitted.  It  was  alleged  that  he  illegally  received  the  extra  money  from  abroad  and  from  Jewish  media  tycoon  Vladimir  Goussinsky,  who  heads  the  Russian  Jewish  Congress.  The  advertisement  mentioned  that  Goussinsky  is  an  Israeli  citizen  and,  clearly  implying  Jewish  and  Israeli  connection,  showed  footage  of  Yavlinsky  sitting  among  /e/pa-wearing  Jews.   It  is  believed  that  Yavlinsky  cap  tured  the  bulk  of  the  Jewish  vote  in  Moscow  and  St  Petersburg.  In  provin  cial  cities  it  is  estimated  that  Jews  voted  for  Putin  in  the  same  percentage  as  the  general  population.  The  main  reason  for  Jewish  support  of  Yavlinsky  in  St  Petersburg  and  Moscow  is  that  his  democratic,  pro-Western  outlook  reflects  their  views  as  members  of  Russia’s  intelligentsia.   Moscow  Chief  Rabbi  Pinchas  Goldschmidt  called  it  “an  act  of  state  antisemitism”  and  said  that  if  “Putin  doesn’t  want  to  be  accused  of  anti  semitism,  he  should  publicly  repudi   ate  these  acts”.   So  the  world  is  holding  its  breath  —  and  waiting.  Harvard  researcher  Carol  Saivetz  is  pessimistic.  She  is  worried  that  once  the  Chechen  war  has  run  its  course,  Jews  could  again  become  scapegoats.  “Should  somebody  run  a  populist  campaign,  Jews  are  the  most  likely  targets.  If  somebody  wants  to  find  blame  for  what  has  happened”  in  Russia  economically  and  politically  during  “the  last  few  years,  the  Jews  are   me  most  UKeiy  targets  .

"  Three  Arab  nations  cut   ties  with  Israel   WASHINGTON:  Diplomatic  relations  between  three  Arab  nations  and  Israel  have  been  cut.   Tunisia,  Morocco  and  Oman  have  all  closed  their  offices  in  Israel,  and  it  is  believed  that  Qatar  may  terminate  its  presence  in  Israel  as  well.   The  decisions  by  Tunisia  and  Morocco  fol  lowed  a  call  by  the  Arab  League  on  its  22  mem  bers  to  freeze  all  but  formal  diplomatic  ties  with  Israel,  which  it  blames  for  inciting  the  current  violence  which  has  left  about  135  people  Wiled,  3500  injured  and  four  Israelis  kidnapped.   Only  three  Arab  League  countries  have  full  diplomatic  relations  with  Israel  —  Egypt,  Jordan  and,  most  recently,  Mauritania  (a  West  African,  predominantly  Muslim  country  which  estab  lished  full  diplomatic  relations  with  Israel  on  October  28,1999).  The  severance  of  ties  is  caus  ing  concern.  “Israel  was  trying  to  build  a  com   rnunity  that  supported  the  peace  process,”  Israel  Embassy  Washington  spokesman  Mark  Regev  said;  “now  that  community  has  been  cut.”   Since  the  1970s,  Morocco  has  been  a  discreet  broker  of  rapprochement  between  Israel  and  Arab  countries,  establishing  relations  in  1994.   .  The  Arab  League  ended  its  summit  in  Cairo  with  a  declaration  that  blamed  Israel  for  the  vio   lence,  but  stopped  short  of  calling  for  severed   relations.  The  summit  was  denounced  across  the  Arab  world,  where  anti-Israel  protests  called  for  harsher  action.  Thousands  of  Egyptian  stu  dents  took  to  the  streets  to  urge  a  “holy  war”.   Further  clashes  erupted  outside  Jerusalem  this  week,  as  well  as  in  the  West  Bank  and  in  Gaza,  with  nightly  exchanges  of  fire  between  Israeli  soldiers  outside  the  Jerusalem  suburb  of  Gilo  and  Palestinians  in  the  West  Bank.   Tanks  fired  at  Palestinian  positions  in  Ramallah,  and  the  army  imposed  a  blockade  on  the  Palestinian  village  of  Beit  Jalla,  from  which  Palestinians  fired  machineguns  into  Gilo.  Barak’s  security  aide,  Danny  Yatom,  warned  that  Israel  would  “intensify”  its  response  if  Palestinians  continue  firing  on  Gilo.   Palestinian  leader  Yasser  Arafat  earlier   responded  to  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak’s  call  for  a  “time-out”  in  the  peace  talks  by  saying  that  anyone  blocking  the  Palestinians’  path  to  a  state  could  “go  to  hell”.   Yet  despite  Barak’s  declaration  of  a  timeout,  Israel  has  no  plans  to  stop  depositing  millions  of  shekels  into  Palestinian  Authority  bank  accounts  each  month.  The  reason,  said  a  senior  official  in  the  Prime  Minister’s  Office,  is  that  the  timeout  is  a  period  to  rethink;  it  is  not  a  cancel  lation  of  the  Oslo  Accords.   While  economic  ties  have  not  been  affected,  security  coordination  and  consultation  has  effectively  ended,  Chief  of  Staff  Lieutenant  General  Shaul  Mofaz  said.  Joint  Palestinian  Israeli  patrols  ceased  once  the  violence  began.   Some  have  criticised  Barak’s  timeout  declara  tion  as  useless,  because  it  changed  nothing  on  the  ground  and  did  not  halt  negotiations  as  no  negotiations  are  taking  place  amid  the  violence.  According  to  this  school  of  thought,  all  that  Barak  did  by  making  the  declaration  was  to  give  ammunition  to  those  who  portray  Israel  as  an  obstinate  partner  who  does  not  want  peace.   A  source  in  the  Prime  Minister’s  Office  said  Barak  remains  convinced  that  the  time-out  is  necessary,  because  he  had  to  send  a  message  to  his  people  that  business  cannot  go  on  as  usual  and  that  Israel  cannot  behave  as  if  nothing  has  happened  over  the  last  four  weeks.   Cabinet  secretary  Isaac  Herzog  said  Barak  felt  there  was  “no  choice  for  a  reasonable  leader  of  a  democratic  country  whose  citizens  are  being  shot  at  in  its  capital  not  to  say  ‘Hold  on,  I  want  to  analyse  where  things  are’.”   Herzog  said  Barak  spoke  to  US  President  Bill  Clinton  and  UN  Secretary-General  Kofi  Annan  about  the  timeout,  and  neither  of  them  “fell  out  of  his  chair”  when  they  heard  about  it.   Nevertheless,  US  sources  have  indicated  con  cern  that  it  is  not  clear  on  what  basis  the  time  out  will  be  ended.  Will  there  now  be  new  condi  tions  before  renewing  the  talks?  And  if  one  of  those  conditions  is  a  cessation  of  violence,  does  that  mean  a  complete  cessation  of  violence?  Does  that  mean  that  Israel  will  not  return  the  call  of  Palestinian  negotiators  if  there  are  sporadic  incidents?  These  questions  remain  unanswered.

"  Lev  Gorodetsky   MOSCOW:  Zisya  Weisman  says  he  will  vote  for  the  incumbent  and  almost-guaranteed  winner,  Vladimir  Putin,  in  next  week’s  Russian  presi   dential  elections.   “First  of  all,  there  is  no  choice.  Others  have  no  chance,""  says  the  55-year-old  retired  Jewish  army  major  from  the  city  of  Samara.   Weisman  said  he  admires  Putin’s  experience  in  the  Soviet-era  KGB.  Plus,  he  says,  Putin  “promised  to  crack  down  on  antisemitism”.   But  Stas  Mogilevsky,  25,  will  vote  for  “none  of  the  above’’,  hoping  to  bring  about  a  second  round  of  elections,  which  would  be  held  if  no  candidate  receives  at  least  50  percent  of  the   vote  in  the  March  26  ballot.   ""Any  signs  of  antisemitism  are   considered  an  inadmissible  display   of  aggressive  nationalism,   incompatible  with  civilised  society   in  Russia.”   “Many  Jewish  people  think  Putin  has  totali  tarian  inclinations  and  is  going  to  crack  down  on  human  rights  and  liberties  and  introduce  a  compulsory  draft  of  students,”  says  Mogilevsky,  a  student  of  psychology  at  Moscow  State  University.  He  added  that  some  of  his  friends  prefer  Communist  leader  Gennady  Zyuganov.   The  presidential  election  comes  after  Putin’s  Unity  bloc  won  the  most  seats  in  December’s  parliamentary  elections.  After  that  vote,  Jewish  observers  here  and  abroad  were  unsure  whether  he  would  support  the  Jewish  commu  nity’s  longstanding  desire  for  the  government  to  crack  down  on  antisemitism  and  support  human  rights.  This  uncertainty  was  heightened  after  Putin  entered  an  alliance  with  the  Communists  after  the  election.   In  the  December  ballot,  Jewish  voters,  in  a  sharp  contrast  to  the  broader  Russian  elec  torate,  overwhelmingly  supported  the  Union  of  Right  Forces,  headed  by  former  Prime  Minister  Sergei  Kiriyenko,  Boris  Nemtsov  and  backed  by  Anatoly  Chubais,  all  reformers  with  Jewish  roots.  But  this  time,  Jews,  particularly  those  liv  ing  outside  Moscow  and  St  Petersburg,  appear  to  be  joining  with  the  majority  of  their  country   men  and  women  in  a  desire  for  Putin’s  “strong  hand  to  crack  down  on  crime,  corruption  and  economic  chaos.  More  than  50  percent  of  Jews  outside  these  two  major  cities  are  expected  to   vote  for  Putin.   But  in  St  Petersburg  and  Moscow,  where  more  than  half  of  Russia’s  600,000  Jews  live,  Jewish  voters  appear  to  be  less  supportive  of  Putin.  A  sizeable  percentage  of  the  Jewish  intel  ligentsia  —  especially  students  in  Moscow  and  St  Petersburg  —  not  only  dislike  Putin,  but  are  scared  by  his  background  in  the  KGB.   Alexander  Lvov,  35,  a  teacher  from  St  Petersburg,  will  probably  vote  for  Yavlinsky  because  he  is  the  “only  one  with  a  human  face”.   Major  Jewish  organisations  in  Russia  are  expressing  “cautious  optimism”  or  maintaining  silence  on  Putin’s  apparently  inevitable  rise.  Representatives  of  the  Russian  Jewish  Congress,  whose  leader,  media  mogul  Vladimir  Goussinsky,  is  battling  with  Putin  and  his  team,  refused  to  state  a  position.   Just  the  same,  perhaps  Putin’s  overtures  to  Jewish  leaders  appear  to  be  paying  off.  In  November,  he  promised  the  leader  of  the  Lubavitch-dominated  Federation  of  Jewish  Communities  of  Russia  to  assist  the  Jewish  community  in  combatting  antisemitism,  build  ing  schools  and  reclaiming  former  synagogue  buildings  for  Jewish  communities.  He  also  told  the  group’s  leaders  that  he  acted  personally  to  help  rebuild  Jewish  life  in  St  Petersburg  in  the  early  1990s,  when  he  was  head  of  the  KGB   there.   Polls  of  the  general  electorate  show  that  Putin  appears  to  be  a  shoo-in,  with  52-55  per  cent  of  the  vote.  Zyuganov  is  expected  to  receive  16-20  percent,  with  other  candidates,  including  ultranationalist  Vladimir  Zhirinovsky  and  Yavlinsky,  trailing  far  behind.  If  Putin  earns  more  than  50  percent,  he  will  avoid  a  second   round  run-off.   Putin  appears  to  be  particularly  popular  among  the  Jews  of  the  North  Caucasus,  who  want  him  to  put  down  the  Muslim  insurgency  there  and  combat  antisemitism  among  Chechen  gangs  who  have  carried  out  a  wave  of  kidnappings,  whose  targets  include  Jews,  and  recently  beat  a  Jewish  hostage  to  death.  “Putin  means  stability.  I  think  that  the  level  of  crime  in  Russia  and  the  situation  around  Chechnya  demand  tough  handling,”  says  Roman  Levayev.

"  ANALYSIS   DAVBD  LANBMU/SMQfVll  SEGAL   JERUSALEM:  Egypt  has  become  the  latest  Arab  country  to  take  diplomatic  action  against  Israel  because  of  the  ongoing  violence  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  Strip.   In  a  sudden  turn  from  its  role  of  mediator,  Egypt  recalled  its  ambassador  to  Israel  this  week.  Egyptian  Foreign  Minister  Amre  Moussa  cited  “Israeli  aggression”  for  the  decision,  adding  that  it  reflected  Cairo’s  “extreme  displeasure”  with  the  way  Israel  was  treating  the  Palestinians.   The  announcement  came  after  Israel  launched  missile  strikes  on  Gaza  City  to  retaliate  for  a  dead  ly  terror  attack  on  an  Israeli  schoolbus  in  Gaza  which  left  two  people  dead  (see  page  19).   The  departure  of  Egypt’s  long-time  envoy,  Mohammed  Basiouny,  leaves  no  Arab  represen  tatives  in  Israel.  Jordan,  the  only  Arab  country  besides  Egypt  to  have  signed  a  treaty  with  Israel,  has  delayed  sending  its  newly-appointed  ambas  sador  to  Tel  Aviv  to  protest  what  it  also  sees  as  aggression  against  the  Palestinians.   The  ongoing  violence  has  also  prompted  Morocco,  Qatar,  Tunisia  and  Oman  to  sever  the  low-level  economic  links  that  each  established  with  Israel  during  more  promising  times  in  the   peace  process.   Egypt’s  recall  of  Basiouny  —  which  could  lead  to  an  eventual  downgrading  of  relations  between  the  two  countries  —  caught  the  Israeli  Foreign  Ministry  by  surprise.  Israelis  officials  expressed  disappointment,  but  said  they  do  not  believe  the  development  indicates  that  the  violence  was  heading  towards  a  wider  conflict.   Foreign  Minister  Shlomo  Ben-Ami  called  the  move  “grave”  and  said  it  would  impede  Egypt’s  ability  to  play  a  role  in  peacemaking.  Moussa  dis  missed  Ben-Ami’s  comment,  saying  Egypt  “shall  participate  in  the  peace  process.  The  peace  process  has  no  tickets  that  Israel  issues.”   Israeli  officials  said  they  had  no  plans  to  recall  Israel’s  ambassador  in  Cairo.  The  last  time  Egypt  recalled  its  ambassador  was  during  Israel’s  1982   war  in  Lebanon.   The  Egyptian  move  threw  into  sharp  relief  the  gulf  between  expectations  and  realities  as  the  cri   Egyptian  Ambassador  to  Israel  Mohammed   Baslouny  during  a  visit  to  the  Beilinson  Children’s   Medical  Centre  in  Tel  Aviv.

Only  two  days  earlier,  former  President  Ezer  Weizman  and  the  Prime  Minister’s  security  chief,  Danny  Yatom,  returned  from  talks  with  Mubarak,  saying  they  believed  he  understood  Israeli  concerns.  And  just  hours  before  Cairo’s  announcement,  Israeli  sources  had  said  Mubarak  would  make  a  last-ditch  effort  to  head  off  a  looming  escalation.   They  said  he  had  summoned  Palestinian  Authority  President  Yasser  Arafat  for  talks,  fol   lowing  an  assurance  from  Weizman  that  Arafat  is  capable  of  reining  in  the  violence  if  wants  to.   Israeli  hopes  of  an  llth-hour  Egyptian  media  tion  effort  seemed  to  have  been  built  on  sand.  The  change  in  atmosphere  was  as  swift  as  it  was  dour.  Indeed,  it  had  looked  promising  last  week  end,  with  Arafat  ordering  Palestinian  gunmen  to  stop  firing  at  Israelis  from  Palestinian-ruled  areas.   Israel  Defence  Force  commanders  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  noticed  a  drop  in  the  number  of  shooting  incidents,  although  a  serious  episode  took  place  in  Gaza,  when  a  Palestinian  police  offi  cer  attacked  an  Israeli  Army  installation,  killing  two  soldiers  before  he  was  shot  dead  by  Israeli  troops.  But  apart  from  that,  the  violence  appeared  to  be  subsiding.   At  the  same  time,  the  diplomatic  track  seemed  to  pick  up  in  intensity.  US  peace  envoy  Dennis  Ross  held  separate  talks  with  Israeli  and  Palestinian  officials,  and  signals  from  Washington  suggested  that  Barak  and  Arafat  had  agreed  that  US  President  Bill  Clinton  try  to  convene  another  three-way  summit.  There  were  even  hints  that  Israel  might  soften  its  opposition  to  the  Palestinians’  demand  that  the  United  Nations  dis  patch  an  observer  force  to  the  West  Bank  and  Ga/a  as  part  of  an  effort  to  stop  the  violence.   Optimists  suggested  that  Clinton  could  cobble  together  an  agreement  that  would  award  the  Palestinians  their  state  in  more  than  90  percent  of  the  territories,  with  the  issue  of  Jerusalem  sov  ereignty  left  for  subsequent  negotiations.  Israel  would  recognise  the  new  state,  and  the  Palestinians  would  pledge  that  the  remaining  issues  would  be  resolved  by  diplomatic  means.   Now,  after  Israel’s  helicopter  strike  on  Gaza  City,  the  Palestinians’  demand  for  the  protection  of  a  UN  force  has  grown  more  strident.  And  Israel  has  reverted  to  its  refusal  to  allow  “the  interna  tionalisation  of  the  conflict”.   With  hopes  of  a  return  to  the  negotiating  table  dimmed  again,  attention  is  focusing  on  the  Muslim  holy  month  of  Ramadan,  which  began  this  week.  Ramadan  is  a  time  of  prayer,  but  in  the  past  weeks,  Israel  has  barred  all  but  elderly  Palestinians  from  praying  on  Jerusalem’s  Temple  Mount.  Experts  say  a  continued  policy  of  restrict   ing  pntrv  rnulH  trigger  further  violence.   JTA ",2000-11-24
"  Yosef   Educating  ourselves   MUCH  has  recently  been  made  of   the  bias  in  the  media  reporting   of  the  recent  crisis.  Some  have  focussed  on  specific  stories  and  the  overt  casting  of  blame;  others  have  noted  the  use  of  particular  terminology.  A  third  aspect  is  the  absence  of  historical  context  in  regard  to  particular  stories.   This  extends  even  to  the  Temple  Mount  —  where  the  uninformed  observer  is  rarely  reminded  that  the  site  was  Jewish  long  before  Islam  arrived  on  the  scene  to  adopt  it  as  significant  just  because  of  its  previous  Jewish  religious  associations.   And  of  course  there  is  the  oft  unspoken  assumption  behind  many  an  accusation:  while  violence  (albeit  by  lethal  stones)  is  not  to  be  criticised  (or  at  least  not  construed  as  really  serious),  the  Israeli  response  is  to  be  criticised.  Such  an  approach  begs  unstated  questions:  if  the  criticism  is  valid,  what  should  Israel  do?  Give  in  to   violence?   Even  those  who  genuinely  believed  in  the  *peace  process’  (as  opposed  to  real  peace)  have  now  had  their  dream  shattered.  Countless  reports  in  the  mainstream  Israeli  press  suggest  that  most  now  realise  that  there  is  no  equivalent  partner  with  whom  to  negotiate.   “The  issue  is  not  Jewish  control  of  particular  sites  or  areas;  it  is  the   very  existence  of  the  Jewish  State  of   Israel  in  the  Middle  East.”   For  the  issue  is  not  Jewish  control  of  particular  sites  or  areas;  it  is  not  just  control  of  the  Temple  Mount.  Rather,  it  is  the  very  existence  of  the  Jewish  State  of  Israel  in  the  Middle  East.  Its  exclusion  from  Palestinian  school  textbooks  was  no  accident.  The  Palestinians  have  bred  generations  of   children  to  view  the  Middle  East  map  without  Israel.   Listen  to  the  widely  reported  sermon  at  Al-Aqsa  Mosque  that  ignited  the  riots  on  erev  Rosh  Hashana:  “Al  Aqsa  Mosque  was  under  the  Crusader’s  occupation  for  more  than  90  years.  It   used  to  be  a  stable  for  their  horses.  But   it  was  only  when  the  Muslim  Ummah  declared  Jihad  that  Al-Aqsa  Mosque   was  liberated.   :“The  same  applies  today.  This  mosque  will  not  be  liberated  until  Jihad  will  be  declared  by  a  trusted  authority,  who  else  would  it  be  except  the  coming  Khalifah  Inshallah  [God  willing].   “I  call  all  the  Muslims  to  work  for  this  purpose:  they  see  the  [day]  indeed  as  a  far-off  [event],  but  we  see  it  [quite]  near.  Amen.”   Last  week  I  cited  Rashi’s  opening  comment  to  Bereishit:   Amar  Rabbi  Yitzchak:  Why  did  the  Torah  begin  with  the  story  of  the  Creation  ...  For  if  the  nations  of  the  world  will  say  to  you  that  you  are  [armed]  robbers  in  that  you  captured  the  lands  of  the  seven  nations,  say  to  them  all  the  earth  belongs  to  the  Holy  One  Blessed  be  He,  He  created  it  and  He  gave  it  to  the  one  that  was  appropriate  in  His  eyes...   As  a  contemporary  of  the  Crusaders,  Rashi  too  witnessed  war  over  Jerusalem.  Of  course  despite  the  havoc  wrought  by  the  Crusaders  upon  Jewish  communities  in  Europe  and  Jerusalem,  that  11th  century  war  over  Jerusalem  was  primarily  between  Christians  and  Moslems.  But  the  message  of  Rashi  is  clear  —  and  equally  relevant  today.   What  are  the  exact  words  of  Rabbi  Yitzchak?  Im  yomru  lachem  umot  ha’olam  —  If  the  nations  of  the  world  will  say  to  you  ...  You  shall  respond  ...   There  are  two  aspects  here.  There  is  the  statement  of  Jewry  to  the  world  —  and  there  is  what  Jewry  says  to  themselves  when  faced  with  a  competing  claim  to  the  land.  The  first  lesson  of  Bereishit  has  to  be  that  when  faced  with  a  claim  that  we  are  robbers,  we  must  first  understand  for  ourselves  that  the  land  is  ours.  Yomru  lachem  —  they  will  say  to  you  —  requires  a  response  such  that  you,  i.e.  Israel,  understand  that  what  is  being  said  is  not  acceptable  to  ourselves.  We  should  not  be  absorbing  that  message  to  the  extent  that  we  (or  at  least  some  of  our  people)  are  beginning  to  believe  it.   Only  when  we  ourselves  are  convinced  of  the  justice  of  our  claim,  can  we  respond  with  statement  of  that  right  to  others  —  and  have  that  viewpoint  accepted.   Regrettably,  it  has  now  largely  been  left  to  a  few  fundamentalist  Christian   groups  to  publicly  express  the  view  of  our  right  to  Israel  that  was  our  commonly  stated  position  a  few  decades  ago  —  and  was  the  basis  of  the  original  UN  decision  to  allocate  to  us  part  of  Palestine,  as  well  as  also  being   the  basis  of  the  text  of  the  Declaration  of  Independence.   We  must  work  together  to  correct  the  bias  of  the  media.  But  as  we  commence  reading  the  biblical  account  that  forms  the  basis  of  our  claim  to  Israel,  we  must  first  educate  ourselves.   Shabbat  Shalom,  Yossi ",2000-10-27
"  Labor  urged  to  condemn  incitement  against  Jews   CANBERRA   FILE   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   ZIONIST  Federation  of  Australia  president  Dr  Ron  Weiser  is  putting  pressure  on  the  Labor  Party  to  speak  out  against  anti-Jewish  incitement  in  Australia.   He  has  written  to  Opposition  Leader  Kim  Beazley  expressing  sadness  that  neither  he,  nor  any  Labor  Party  representative  had  publicly  called  for  an  end  to  violent  attacks  on  Australia’s  Jewish  community.  He  had  earlier  written  to  Mr  Beazley  asking  him  to  make  such  a  statement.   “As  well,”  he  wrote,  “neither  yourself  nor  the  Australian  Labor  Party  have  to  date  been  willing  or  able  to  call  upon  leaders  of  the  Arabic  com  munity  to  issue  public  calls  for  restraint  and  adherence  to  Australian  law  in  regards  to  attacks  on  Jewish  individuals  and  institutions.”   In  response,  Mr  Beazley’s  office  called  Dr  Weiser  last  Friday  promising  a  statement  this  week  appealing  for  calm  and  a  return  to  the  negotiating  table.   Dr  Weiser’s  letter  followed  a  series  of  attacks  against  Jewish  targets  in  Sydney,  Canberra  and  Melbourne,  but  pre-dated  last  week’s  arson  attack  against  Bondi’s  Machzika  Hatorah  Congregation  Shule.   Earlier,  Dr  Weiser  had  written  to  Labor  MP  Anthony  Albanese,  the  secretary  of  the  parlia  mentary  friends  of  Palestine  group,  who  addressed  a  rally  in  Sydney  last  month  in  which  Arab  demonstrators  burned  Israeli  and  US  flags.   In  one  letter  to  Mr  Albanese,  who  represents  an  inner-western  Sydney  seat,  Dr  Weiser  described  a  Jewish  youth  solidarity  and  peace  rally  in  Woollahra.   “You  really  need  to  ask  yourself  the  following  question:  Why  is  it  that  during  the  Palestinian  rally,  the  police  were  facing  the  protesters,  whilst  during  the  rally  of  the  Jewish  community,  the  police  were  facing  outwards.   “The  answer  is  obvious  —  the  police  know  very  well  that  at  Palestinian  rallies,  the  danger  is  from  the  protesters,  whereas  at  Jewish  commu  nity  rallies,  the  danger  is  to  the  participants.”   Dr  Weiser  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  while  Mr  Beazley  had  said  nothing,  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  had  condemned  demon  strators  who  burned  flags.   “At  least  this  government  is  having  this  dia  logue  with  us,”  he  said,  referring  to  Immigration  Minister  Phil  Ruddock’s  recent  meetings  with  Jewish  community  leaders  in  Melbourne,  Sydney  and  Canberra.   None  of  these  meetings,  which  were  balanced  with  similar  conversations  with  Arab  community  leaders,  have  produced  public  statements  point  ing  the  finger  at  Australia’s  Arab  community.  Mr   Ruddock  has  been  careful  in  his  condemnation  of  attacks  on  Jewish  community  sites  not  to  refer  publicly  to  the  role  of  the  Arab  community.   Both  Coalition  and  Labor  MPs  have  been  cau  tious  on  this  issue  because  several  represent  the  interests  of  electorates  heavily  populated  by   Muslim  voters.   Meanwhile,  a  bi-partisan  motion  is  being  put  before  Federal  Parliament  expressing  disap  pointment  that  Israel’s  “far-reaching  and  courageous  proposals”  at  Camp  David  were  not  “seized  by  all  parties  to  the  peace  process”.   And  Labor  MP  for  Melbourne  Ports,  Michael  Danby,  who  drafted  the  motion  with  the  the  Liberal  chairman  of  the  Australia-Israel  parlia  mentary  friendship  group,  Chris  Payne,  has  called  on  Jewish  community  leaders  to  come   to  Canberra  to  brief  MPs.   Notice  of  the  motion,  which  declares  that  “peaceful  coexistence  is  the  only  option  for  both  Israelis  and  Palestinians”,  was  given  in  the  House  of  Representatives  last  week.  But  with  parliament  meeting  for  only  another  eight  days,  procedural  arrangements  and  pressure  of  other  business,  provide  just  two  more  opportunities  this  year  —  on  November  27  or  December  4  —  for  it  to  be  moved.   It  calls  on  Israelis  and  Palestinians  to  imme  diately  stop  all  violent  acts  and  to  resume  negotiations  without  the  threat  of  violence  or  of  a  “premature  announcement  of  unilateral   declarations”.   And  it  expresses  grief  for  “the  innocent  lives   lost  on  both  sides  and  condemns  the  unac  ceptable  inclusion  of  children  in  violent  activi   ties  on  the  front  line”.   Opposition  Leader  Kim  Beazley   Outside  parliament,  Mr  Danby  called  on  Australia’s  Jewish  community  leaders  to  come  to  Canberra  and  make  “a  comprehensive,  inte  grated  sweep  through  Parliament  House  to  shore  up  Israel’s  many  friends  and  to  back  ground  the  many  open-minded  and  impartial  parliamentarians”.   He  said  recent  violent  attacks  on  Jewish  tar  gets  in  Sydney  and  Canberra  were  intolerable  and  he  felt  very  deeply  the  fear  and  trepida  tion  when  he  attended  communal  functions.   “Palestinian  advocates  and  delegates  have  been  present  in  Parliament  House  since  the  vio  lence  broke  out  last  month,”  Mr  Danby  said.  “Friends  of  Israel  need  to  see  and  hear  their  friends  in  the  Australian  Jewish  community.” ",2000-11-10
"  needs  as  crucial,   rabbi   Samanfifta  Bazfen   THE  spiritual  needs  of  the  15,000  athletes  and  offi  cials  in  the  Olympic  Village  are  as  critical  to  their  performances  on  the  track  as  their  physical   needs.   That’s  according  to  Great  Synagogue  Rabbi  Mendel  Kastel,  and  he  is  on  hand  to  cater  for  those  requirements.   Based  at  the  Religious  Centre  in  the  Olympic  Village,  Rabbi  Kastel  will  run  Friday  evening  and  Saturday  morning  Shabbat  services,  as  well  as  Rosh  Hashana  services  for  athletes  and  officials  living  in  the  Olympic  Village.   During  the  Paralympics,  Rabbi  Kastel  and  his  team  of  three  Bnei  Akiva  leaders  Jeremy  Gold,  Simon  Miles  and  Rebecca  Gordon  will  continue  the  work,  building  a  succah  adjacent  to  the  Religious  Centre.   “Jews  are  coming  to  the  Olympic  Village  from  all  parts  of  the  world  and  many  want  to  practise  their  religion  and  connect  with  the  Australian  Jewish  community,”  Rabbi  Kastel  said.  “We’ll  be  there  to  help  them  do  that,  whether  through  prayer,  counselling  or  study.”   Under  International  Olympic  Committee  regu  lations,  space  must  be  made  available  in  the  Olympic  Village  for  prayer.  The  Religious  Centre  includes  adjoining  rooms  to  accommodate  the  Hindu,  Muslim,  Buddhist,  Christian  and  Jewish  faiths.  The  Christian  and  Jewish  faiths  share  a  room,  “with  a  partition  that  can  be  moved  to  accommodate  more  people  on  the  Jewish  side  during  Shabbat,  or  more  people  on  the  Christian  side  for  Sunday  mornings”,  Rabbi  Kastel  said.   Proselytising  in  the  Olympic  Village  is  out  lawed.  “There  was  concern  that  some  religions  would  try  to  use  their  presence  to  convert  peo  ple;  there  was  evidence  of  this  behaviour  at  the  Atlanta  Games,  so  the  organisers  decided  to  use  a  chaplaincy  group  they  knew.”   Rabbi  Kastel  was  referring  to  the  NSW  Police  Service  Chaplains.  “Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  is  a  police  chaplain,  and  they  approached  him  to  set  up  the  synagogue,  and  he  passed  the  task  to  me.”   Anticipating  that  much  of  his  time  in  the  Village  will  be  spent  counselling  athletes,  he  added:  “The  Olympics  is  a  high-pressure  environment  where  athletes  are  likely  to  need  counselling  on  two  fronts  —  before  an  event,  when  they  need  some  one  to  chat  to,  or  if  they  don’t  make  it  to  the  gold  medal.  We  pray  that  no  crisis  situations  develop.”   Rabbi  Kastel  had  to  overcome  some  unusual  challenges  in  setting  up  the  synagogue.  ‘We  had  to  get  special  security  clearance  to  take  the  Torah  in  and  out  of  the  Village  during  the  Games.  Ordinarily,  you  are  only  allowed  to  take  in  what  can  fit  in  a  bum-bag,  so  we’ll  take  in  telillin  that  way.  We’ve  already  taken  in  prayer-books,  tallitot,  Kiddish  wine  and  Shabbat  candles.”   Building  the  succah  will  be  an  expensive  oper  ation,  he  noted.  “It  will  cost  a  lot  to  get  all  the  materials  delivered,  and  because  of  security  and  traffic,  it  will  take  a  long  time  for  it  to  get  here.”   Olympic  Religious  Centre  Rabbi  Mendel  Kastel...  “Athletes  are  likely  to  need  counselling  before  an  event,  or  if  they  don't  make  it  to  the  gold  .medal.”   Rabbi  Kastel  has  already  received  numerous  inquiries  at  the  Religious  Centre  from  Israelis,  Americans  and  Canadians,  as  well  as  Australians,  Jewish  and  non-Jewish.  “We’re  in  the  village  square,  so  we  get  interest  from  people  passing  by.  The  synagogue  is  open  to  everybody  from  8am  until  11pm.  It  is  set  up  like  a  synagogue  all  the  time,  so  people  can  come  in  and  pray  on  their  own,  and  I’m  on  call  24  hours  a  day  in  case  peo  ple  need  to  talk.   “The  amount  of  services  we  run  will  depend  on  demand.  All  the  religions  are  in  a  similar  position.  It’s  possible  we  will  hold  daily  prayers,  particu  larly  if  someone  wants  to  say  Kaddish.  We  will   also  hold  shiurim  if  there  is  interest.”   Rabbi  Kastel’s  outreach  activities  have  taken  him  to  a  range  of  diverse  places,  from  Russia  to  Kathmandu  in  Nepal  to  a  day  camp  in  Belgium.  “Growing  up  in  Chabad,  Fve  had  opportunities  to  work  with  communities  all  over  the  world.  This  is  a  unique  experience,  and  while  I’ve  been  a  chap  lain  for  Maccabi  before,  it’s  never  been  anything   on  this  scale.   “It’s  wonderful  to  be  able  to  work  with  Jewish  communities  from  around  the  world.  I  speak  a  bit  of  Russian,  I  grew  up  speaking  Yiddish  and  I  speak  Hebrew,  so  it  will  give  me  the  chance  to  make  friends  with  our  overseas  visitors.” ",2000-09-15
"  News  Extra   Hamas,  Hezbollah  have  links  in  Australia   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   A  SENIOR  Foreign  Affairs  Department  official  has  named  Hezbollah  and  Hamas  among  terror  ist  groups  which  have  supporters  and  networks   in  Australia.   A  joint  parliamentary  committee  inquiry  in  Canberra  into  Australia’s  relations  with  the   Middle  East  heard  from  diplomat  and  Middle  East  expert  Bob  Bowker  that  most  Middle  East  political  organisations  have  a  coterie  of  sup  porters  and  networks  among  ethnic,  religious  and  language  groups  in  Australia.   “Most  of  the  elements  of  the  Kurdish  political  factions  have  support  facilities  in  Australia,”  Mr  Bowker  said.  “Hamas  clearly  has  some  support  ers.  They  have  publications  in  Australia.  The  activities  of  Hezbollah  have  been  supported  from  time  to  time  by  people  in  Australia  as  well.”   Mr  Bowker  said  many  of  the  groups  espous  ing  political  Islam  had  strong  support  bases  out  side  the  Middle  East.  “We  have  seen  the  devas  tating  effects  in  New  York  of  such  support,”  he  said,  apparently  alluding  to  the  1993  New  York  World  Trade  Centre  bombing  in  which  six  peo  ple  were  killed  and  more  than  1000  injured.   When  committee  chairman  Liberal  MP  David  Jull  asked  if  there  was  any  evidence  to  support   allegations  of  support  for  various  terrorist  organisations  with  funds  or  personnel,  Mr  Bowker  said  he  could  not  comment  publicly,  but  added:  “You  would  be  aware  of  the  level  of  pro  tection  which  the  government  sees  fit  to  extend  to  various  foreign  dignitaries  visiting  Australia.  I  can  assure  that  those  provisions  to  provide  pro  tection  are  not  taken  lightly.”  SETTIEMEN1S   COMMITTEE  members  Liberal  MP  Chris  Pyne,  a  member  of  parliament’s  Israel  friendship  group,  and  Labor  MP  Janice  Crosio,  whose  Western  Sydney  electorate  of  Prospect  has  a  large  Muslim  population,  clashed  over  claims  that  Israeli  settlements  continue  to  expand  in  the  West  Bank.   Bob  Bowker  was  caught  in  the  middle  of  what  Ms  Crosio  described  as  a  debate,  when  he  told  her  that  Australia  had  made  a  strong  statement  of  principle  in  the  UN  General  Assembly  last  year,  declaring  that  settlement  activity  then  going  on  in  the  occupied  territories  was  con  trary  to  international  law  and  harmful  to  the  peace  process.  Ms  Crosio  wanted  to  know  what  Australia  had  done  “to  persuade  Israel  to  cease  further  building  of  settlements”.  In  response,  Mr  Bowker  agreed  with  her  that  Australia  had  acknowledged  “that  settlements  are  still  being   built”.   When  Mr  Pyne  asked  Mr  Bowker  to  identify  where  these  new  settlements  were  being  built  and  how  far  they  might  be  from  the  perimeter  of   Janice  Croslo  MP   Jerusalem,  Mr  Bowker  identified  Har  Homa  as  “the  most  obvious  settlement  activity”  to  have  attracted  international  attention.   Mr  Pyne  pointed  out  that  this  information  was  “very  dated”  —  three  years  old,  at  least  —  and  the  settlement  was  within  the  municipality  of  Jerusalem.  “Mrs  Crosio  would  create  the  impres  sion  that  the  Israelis  are  building  settlements  all  across  the  West  Bank  as  we  speak,”  Mr  Pyne  said.  “The  truth  is  that  since  Har  Homa,  there  has  been  virtually  no  settlement  activity...”   Mr  Bowker  mentioned  A1  Jib,  an  area  close  to  Ramallah,  where  he  said  a  settlement  was  “on  the  ground  for  several  days”  before  Israeli  forces  forcibly  removed  it.   At  this  point,  Victorian  Liberal  MP  Peter  Nugent  joined  in,  calling  for  the  Foreign  Affairs  Department  to  verify  reports  about  linking  of  “a  lot  of  existing  settlements”  in  Hebron.   Ms  Crosio  said  she  also  wanted  to  know  what  the  Israeli  Government  of  Israel  had  allocated  in  its  budgets  this  year  and  last  for  settlements  and  extensions  to  existing  settlements,  where  they  were  being  buUt  and  what  roads  were  being  built  to  go  into  them.  She  said  she  already  had  the  information  about  settlements  and  extensions,  but  wanted  the  Foreign  Affairs  Department  to  supply  the  information.  “That  is  the  only  way  we  can  get  it  on  the  record,  and  it  will  not  be  me  or  Mr  Pyne  or  anybody  else  debating  the  issues,”  she  said  before  changing  the  subject  to  con  cerns  about  sanctions  in  Iraq.   But  she  returned  to  the  issue  when  Austcare  Middle  East  program  manager  Martine  Vanderveld,  speaking  for  the  Australian  Council  for  Overseas  Aid,  told  the  committee  that  the  West  Bank  had  been  “divided  into  small   Palestinian  territories  surrounded  by  Israeli  set  tlements”  which  were  expanding  at  a  higher  rate  than  during  the  intifada.   Ms  Vanderfeld  promised  Ms  Crosio  and  Mr  Nugent  she  would  provide  the  committee  with  the  latest  figures  and  data  which  were  published  regularly  in  a  publication  called  Settlement   Monitor.

"  United  capital  of  the  Jewish  people   Following  a  recent  visit  to  Israel  Rabbi  Nir  Gurevitch  shares  his  thoughts  on  the  status  of  Jerusalem.   SINCE  Biblical  times  Jerusalem  has  served  as  the  capital  of  our  Holy  Land.  Yet  today  there  is  a  need  to  clarify  some  issues  per  taining  to  the  rightful  ownership  of  this  Holy  City.   Jerusalem  is  the  only  capital  for  the  Jew  ish  people  and  the  State  of  Israel.  Neverthe  less  it  is  undeniably  cherished  and  respected  by  all  monotheistic  religions,  Judaism,  Christianity  and  Islam.  To  whom  does  it  belong?  Who  are  its  rightful  citizens,  and  can  there  ever  be  harmony  and  dual  existence  in  this  holy  city?   The  very  first  source  one  should  look  into  is  our  Torah.  The  Bible  records  that  Abraham  our  forefather  received  the  Land  of  Israel  from  Hashem,  as  a  gift  to  him  and  all  his  descendants  —  the  Jewish  people.  One  of  the  first  things  Abraham  did  when  he  reached  the  Holy  Land  was  to  visit  Jerusalem,  referred  to  in  the  Torah  as  Salem  (home  of  Malchizedek).  Simply  because   even  then  Jerusalem  was  viewed  as  the   heart  of  the  promised  land.   In  our  long  history  there  were  many  tyrants  motivated  to  deny  Jerusalem  as  the  capital  of  the  Jewish  State.  They  wanted  to  amputate  the  Heart.  They  knew  that  with  out  a  heart  a  body  couldn’t  function.  With  out  Jerusalem,  its  heart,  the  state  would  wither,  and  without  the  Jewish  state,  Judaism  and  the  Jewish  people  would  not  be  able  to  survive.   Towards  the  end  of  the  second  century,  the  infamous  Roman  Emperor  Hadrian  want  ed  to  root  out  Judaism.  The  very  first  step  Hadrian  took  in  his  effort  to  eradicate  Judaism  and  our  people,  was  to  erase  Jerusalem  from  the  map  of  the  world.  He  had  the  city  plowed  over.  He  then  renamed  it  Aelia  Capitolina  —  and  decreed  that  Jerusalem  should  never  rise  again.   We  all  know  of  the  well-respected  monarch,  the  late  King  Hussein  of  Jordan,  who  was  greatly  admired  for  his  resolution  of  making  peace  with  Israel  after  many  years  of  hostility.  His  grandfather  had  captured  the  Old  City  as  one  of  the  spoils  of  his  war  of  aggression  in  1948.  One  of  the  earliest  actions  of  his  troops  had  been  the  desecra  tion  and  destruction  of  Jerusalem’s  syna  gogues  including  the  Hurva.  During  the  reign  of  his  successor,  his  grandson  the  late  King  Hussein,  the  Jordanians  uprooted  the  monuments  of  the  sacred  cemetery  of  Mount  of  Olives.  The  ruins  of  synagogues  were  used  as  stables  for  horses,  and  the  monuments  and  gravestones  turned  into  latrines  for  the  occupying  troops.   During  the  19  years  of  Jordan’s  occupa  tion  of  East  Jerusalem,  no  Jew  was  permit  ted  to  live  in  or  enter  its  boundaries.  In  those  days  one  had  to  climb  to  the  top  of  the  YMCA  building  in  the  newer  section  of  Jerusalem  or  the  Dormition  Abbey  on  Mt  Zion  if  one  wanted  to  glance  wistfully  at  the  Old  City.   Incidentally,  Muslim  Arabs  living  in  Israel  were  also  forbidden  to  enter  the  Old  City,  and  Christians  living  in  Israel  were  permit  ted  to  enter  only  at  Christmas  and  Easter.  It  was  only  when  the  State  of  Israel  liberated  Eastern  Jerusalem  in  1967  that  it  became  once  again  accessible  to  all  religions,  faith  and  creeds  and  the  sacred  shrines  of  all  peo  ple  were  respected  and  protected.   During  World  War  I,  Chaim  Weizmann  (who  would  later  become  the  first  President  of  the  Israel)  was  urging  the  Jewish  claim  to  Palestine  and  to  Jerusalem  upon  prominent  British  statesman  Lloyd  George.  The  Eng  lishman  asked,  “Dr  Weizmann,  why  do  you  Jews  want  Jerusalem  so  much?”   Weizman  replied  by  asking,  “Why  do  you   British  want  London?”   “But  my  dear  Dr  Weizmann,  we  English   men  have  London.”   Chaim  Weizmann  retorted,  “Well,  we  Jews  had  Jerusalem  when  London  was  a  swamp.”   Jerusalem  has  always  been  Jewish.  Mohammed  never  stepped  in  Jerusalem  while  he  was  alive.  The  Koran  describes  his  night  journey  to  the  Holy  City  in  which  he  tethered  his  faithful  winged  steed  to  the  Wall.  According  to  Muslim  belief,  on  the  day  of  his  death,  he  was  lifted  over  the  miles  to  Jerusalem  at  night,  when  it  was  dark  and  nobody  could  see.  From  there  he  ascended  to  heaven  from  the  spot  where  the  Dome  of  the  Rock  is  today.  However,  during  his  natu  ral  life,  he  never  entered  Jerusalem.   Three  times  Jerusalem  was  the  capital  of  the  Jewish  commonwealth:  once  from  1000  BCE  to  586  BCE,  again  from  518  BCE  to  the  year  70  CE,  and  now  from  1948  or  at  least  1967  to  the  end  of  time.   The  Moslems  came  into  the  area  in  the  seventh  century.  They  ruled  the  city  for  480  years.  Yet  not  once  did  they  make  Jerusalem  the  capital  of  an  Arab  state.  When  Jordan  ruled  Jerusalem  for  19  years  by  conquest  of  arms,  neither  King  Hussein  nor  his  grandfather  ever  designated  Jerusalem  their  capital.   Jerusalem  is  of  primary  importance  only  to  the  Jews.  And  I  emphasise  primary.  To  Christians  there  is  first  Bethlehem,  then  Nazareth  and  only  third,  Jerusalem.  To  some  Christians  their  focal  point  is  Rome,  to  others  it  is  Constantinople.  To  still  others,  it  is  Canterbury.  To  Mormons,  it  is  Salt  Lake  City,  Utah.  To  the  Muslims,  their  holiest  metropolis  is  Mecca,  then  Medina  and  only   third  Jerusalem.   Only  to  Jews  does  Jerusalem  come  first.  Only  to  Jews  is  Jerusalem  central.  For  us,  Judaism  without  Jerusalem  is  not  Judaism.  Of  the  six  fast  days  on  the  Jewish  calendar,  four  commemorate  the  destruction  of  Jerusalem.   Mohammed  never   stepped  in  Jerusalem   while  he  was  alive.*   In  our  happiest  moment  at  a  wedding  we  break  a  glass  in  mourning  for  Jerusalem.  At  a  funeral  we  recite  a  special  Kaddish  for  the  return  of  Jerusalem  and  we  pour  into  the  grave  soil  from  the  earth  of  Jerusalem.  That  same  Kaddish  is  also  recited  each  time  we   complete  study  of  a  tractate  of  Talmud,  teaching  that  every  achievement  we  may  make  in  the  spiritual  realm  is  tied  to  prayer   for  the  return  to  Jerusalem   It  is  only  the  Jews  who  pray  three  times  a  day  for  the  return  of  Zion.  It  is  we  who  must  face  toward  the  direction  of  Jerusalem   whenever  we  pray.  Not  the  Arabs,  who  face  towards  Mecca.  Even  when  the  President  of  Egypt,  the  late  Anwar  Sadat,  prayed  in  a  mosque  in  Jerusalem  he  turned  in  prayer  away  from  the  very  city  in  which  stood  —  to   face  toward  Mecca.   Unfortunately,  we  live  in  a  time  when  many  individuals,  politicians  and  govern  ments  seek  to  conceal  who  possesses  right  ful  ownership  of  Jerusalem  as  the  capital  of  Israel.  They  also  ignore  the  fact  that  it  is  the  State  of  Israel  that  recognises  and  maintains  the  principles  of  multiculturalism,  religious  freedom  and  peaceful  coexistence.  This  is  what  Israel  strives  for,  more  then  any  past  government  in  Israel.   I  remember  hearing  a  beautiful  insight  from  Rabbi  Tobias  Silberman  about  the  issue  of  dividing  Jerusalem.  We  are  all  aware  of  the  classic  Biblical  story  about  the  wisest   Above:  Hachurva  bechurbanah  —  the   Hurva  Synagogue  as  it  appeared  in  1967.  Right:The  Hurva  in  its  pre  1948  glory.   Photos  Hanova  Hayehudi  Ba'tr  Ha'atika   of  all  men,  King  Solomon,  who  was  sitting  on   his  throne  when  two  women  came  in  for  judgement.  Each  had  given  birth  to  a  healthy  child,  but  during  the  course  of  the  night  one  baby  died,  and  his  mother  replaced  her  dead  child  with  the  live  one.  In  the  morning  the  rightful  mother  knew  that  the  dead  child  did  not  belong  to  her;  that  the  live  one  had  been  taken  away  from  her.   Nevertheless  the  second  mother  claimed  the  live  baby.   Standing  before  King  Solomon  waiting  to  hear  a  verdict,  King  Solomon  ordered  that  the  live  child  be  taken  and  sliced  into  two.  One  half  was  to  be  given  to  the  first  mother  and  the  other  half  to  the  second,  thus  both  would  receive  an  equal  share.  It  seemed  a  perfect  compromise.  But  at  that  moment,  the  true  mother  spoke  up,  naturally  protest  ing  about  killing  the  baby.  “I  would  rather  give  it  away,  as  long  as  he  remains  alive,”  she  said.  The  lying  mother  on  the  other  hand  declared:  “I  am  happy  with  the  com  promise  —  slice  the  child.”   At  that  moment,  King  Solomon  ordered  that  the  live  baby  be  handed  to  his  true  mother.  The  one  who  compassionately  protested  against  division  must  be  the  true   mother.   Today,  Israel  is  under  tremendous  pres  sure  to  determine  the  rightful  owner  of  this  precious  child,  the  most  important  com  modity  that  we  possess,  the  holiest  site  in  the  world.  We  are  further  challenged  with  a  seemingly  ‘healthy’  compromise  to  divide  the  child,  to  slice  Jerusalem  into  two.  Yet  instead  of  screaming  out  and  protesting,  showing  to  the  rest  of  the  world  that  Jerusalem  is  rightfully  ours,  and  even  a  sin  gle  centimetre  will  not  be  cut,  we  we  keep  silent.  Sadly  there  are  even  some  who  pub  licly  speak  of  ways  to  hand  over  Jerusalem  to  the  guillotine.  If  the  government  of  Israel  and  the  people  of  Israel  would  firmly  pub  licly  announce  that  Jerusalem  is  not  nego  tiable,  we  would  avoid  pressure  and  negotiations.   I  will  only  conclude  with  a  story  I  once  heard  from  a  Jew  who  visited  Israel  follow  ing  the  Six  Day  War  when  Jerusalem  was  recaptured.  Whilst  in  the  city  he  went  to  visit  a  newly  established  yeshivah  near  the  Kotel.  He  noticed  that  one  individual  poring  over  a  large  Talmudic  tractate  had  a  patch  on  his  eye  similar  to  the  late  General  Moshe  Dayan.  In  conversation  the  Talmudic  stu  dent  related  that  he  had  lost  his  eye  in  the  battle  for  the  liberation  of  Jerusalem.  Natu  rally  the  visitor  began  to  sympathise.  But  the  young  man  stopped  him  short.  “Don’t  feel  bad  about  the  loss  of  my  eye,”  he  said.   “When  I  entered  the  battle  1  was  prepared  to  give  my  life  away  for  Jerusalem.  I  thank  God  he  only  took  an  eye.”   We  in  Australia  are  not  asked  to  give  our  lives  away  for  Israel,  not  even  an  eye.  What  we  should  consider  is  giving  our  sincere  and  honest  thought  to  truthfully  and  honestly  accepting  that  Jerusalem  is  Jewish  and  rightfully  belong  to  the  Jewish  people.   Let  us  only  hope  that  we  should  merit  to  see  an  everlasting  Shalom  in  Israel,  with  the  immediate  arrival  of  Moshiach.   ■  Rabbi  Nir  Gurevitch  is  Minister  of  the  Gold  Coast  Hebrew  Congregation,  Surfers  Paradise.

"  Five  years  after   the  assassination   FIVE  years  ago,  on  November  4,  1995,  Israeli  Prime   Minister  Yitzhak  Rabin  was  assassinated.  He  was  assassi  nated  because  he  had  embarked  on  the  Oslo  initiative  with  the  Palestinian  people  —  a  course  which  elicited  severe  disfavour  among  a  substantial  segment  of  the  Israeli  popula  tion.  He  was  assassinated  because  he  breached  a  major  barri  er  in  the  Israeli  psyche  by  shaking  hands  with  Yasser  Arafat  on  the  White  House  Lawn  on  September  13,  1993.  He  was  assassi  nated  because  he  continued  to  seek  an  accommodation  with  the  Palestinians  while  Binyamin  Netanyahu  demonised  him  and  Likud  followers  waved  effigies  of  him  in  Nazi  uniform.   The  tragedy  of  the  violence  which  has  shaken  Israel  for  five  weeks  is  that  it  occurred  just  16  months  after  the  accession  to  power  of  Ehud  Barak  on  a  platform  of  achieving  a  workable  peace  with  the  Palestinian  people.   The  tragedy  of  the  hatred  which  has  characterised  the  vio  lence  —  seared  into  Israel’s  subconscious  by  the  lynching  of  the  two  reserve  soldiers  —  is  that  it  occurred  just  two  months  after  Barak  offered  the  Palestinians  infinitely  more  than  any  Israeli  Prime  Minister  has  ever  offered,  or  is  likely  to  offer:  92  percent  of  the  West  Bank,  control  of  the  Muslim  and  Christian  sectors  of  Jerusalem,  a  form  of  United  Nations  administration  of  the  Temple  Mount,  and  a  proposal  for  dealing  with  Palestinian  refugees  which  included  compensation  and  some  right  of  return.  Yet  Arafat  walked  away.   If  the  violence  had  occurred  under  Binyamin  Netanyahu,  it  would  still  have  been  inexcusable,  but  one  could  have  argued  that  frustration  had  reached  breakpoint  at  the  lack  of  progress  towards  statehood.  But  it  occurred  during  the  tenure  of  the  man  who  had  stated  that  there  would  be  two  Jerusalems  —  a  capital  of  Israel  and  a  capital  of  Palestine.   The  tragedy  is  that  Rabin’s  dream  of  living  hand-in-hand  with  the  Palestinians  —  articulated  so  idealistically  in  the  speech  he  gave  minutes  before  being  shot  (see  facing  page)  —  is  in  tat  ters,  destroyed  first  by  the  visceral  hatred  of  the  Palestinians,  and  in  case  there  were  any  mistaking  the  intent  of  the  con  frontations,  underscored  by  statements  from  Hamas  that  its  objective  is  the  total  elimination  of  Israel.   The  tragedy  is  that  the  bias  in  the  world  media,  exacerbated  by  the  abysmal  lack  of  context,  has  seen  Israel  turn  in  on  itself.  Speaking  after  being  elected  Prime  Minister  in  1992,  Rabin  said:  “No  longer  is  it  true  that  the  whole  world  is  against  us.  We  must  overcome  the  sense  of  isolation  that  has  held  us  in  its  thrall  for  almost  half-a-century.  We  must  join  the  international  movement  towards  peace,  reconciliation  and  co-operation  that  is  spreading  over  the  entire  globe  these  days,  lest  we  be  the  last  to  remain,  all  alone,  in  the  station.”   It  was  a  significant  moment  in  Israel’s  maturation.  It  marked   a  turning-point  in  Israel’s  perception  of  its  place  in  the  world.  With  the  Oslo  process  elevating  Israel’s  standing  to  unprecedented  levels,  Jerusalem  opened  so  many  embassies  that  it  did  not  have  enough  diplomats  to  staff  them  all.   Three  weeks  ago,  Barak  remarked  that  Israel  currently  has  fewer  friends  than  it  has  had  in  a  long  time.  If  this  sentiment  is  permitted  to  take  root,  it  will  create  the  danger  of  a  return  to  the  era  of  isolationism  and  siege  mentality,  which  led  to  hard  line  policies,  which  augmented  the  isolationism.  The  inclusion  of  Ariel  Sharon  in  government  would  accelerate  that  process.   This  is  not  to  suggest  that  right  is  all  on  one  side.  A  Palestinian  state  is  long  overdue.  Israeli  Arabs  feel  that  they  are  second-class  citizens.  Both  are  legitimate  grievances.  Both  need  to  be  addressed.   In  the  meantime,  there  will  need  to  be  statesmanlike  leader  ship  on  both  sides  if  there  is  to  be  any  hope  of  restoring  life  to  the  words  spoken  by  Yitzhak  Rabin  on  the  White  House  Lawn  when  he  shook  Arafat’s  hand  in  1993:   “Let  me  say  to  the  Palestinians:  We  are  destined  to  live  togeth  er,  on  the  same  soil.  We,  the  soldiers  who  have  returned  from  battle  stained  with  blood,  we  who  have  seen  our  relatives  and  friends  killed  before  our  eyes,  we  who  have  attended  their  funer  als  and  cannot  look  into  the  eyes  of  their  parents,  we  who  have  come  from  a  land  where  parents  bury  their  children,  we  who  have  fought  against  you,  the  Palestinians  —  we  say  to  you  today:  Enough  of  blood  and  tears.  Enough.   “We,  like  you,  want  to  build  a  home,  to  plant  a  tree,  to  love,  live  side  by  side  with  you  —  in  dignity,  in  empathy,  as  human  beings,  as  free  men.  We  are  giving  peace  a  chance  and  again  saying  to  you:  Let  us  pray  that  a  day  will  come  when  we  will  say  enough,  farewell  to  arms.  We  wish  to  turn  over  a  new  chapter  in  the  sad  book  of  our  lives  together  —  a  chapter  of  mutual  recog  nition,  of  good  neighbourliness,  of  mutual  respect,  of  under  standing.  We  hope  to  embark  on  a  new  era  in  the  history  of  the   Middle  East."" ",2000-11-03

"  Yosef   DAVID  Ben-Gurion  did  not   need  to  be  to  convinced  that  the  Tanach  serves  as  our  title  deed  to  the  Land  of  Israel.  But  within  the  Tanach  and   its  multiple  references  to  our  ownership  of  the  land,  there  is  one  place  singled  out  for  special  mention  as  having  been  acquired  through  legal  process:  Hebron  (known  in  Hebrew  as  Chevron).   For  many  years  now,  Shabbat  Parshat  Chaye  Sarah  has  been  celebrated  by  thousands  of  people  who  come  to  spend   Shabbat  with  the  settlers  in   Hebron  or  in  the  nearby  Jewish  settlement  of  Kiryat  Arba.  Concerts  featuring  noted  religious  singers  are  held  at  the   outskirts  of  Me’arat  Hamachpelah  (Cave  of  Machpelah),  whilst  lectures  on  the  history  and  significance  of  Hebron  are  delivered  by  respected  speakers  on  the  subject   The  reason?  In  this  week’s  parshah  we  are  told  how  the  patriarch  Abraham  purchased  the  title  to  the  Cave  of  Machpelah.  Rejecting  any  generous  offer  that  would  have  made  it  his  by  gift,  he  insisted  on  paying  for  the  property  in  question.  And  so  we  are  told  that  he  paid  the  full  value,  and  perhaps  even  more  than  anticipated:  four  hundred  shekels  of  silver  of  the  best  qualify  —  over  lasocher  —  as   used  in  commerce.   Of  course,  our  neighbours,  the  Palestinians,  who  dispute  our  title  to  our  land  are  also  interested  in  this  biblical  story.  They  too  see  themselves  as  heirs  to  Abraham  with  a  rightful  claim  to  the  site.   However,  regardless  of  the  debate  surrounding  the  Me’arah  and  its  title,  there  is  less  controversy  about  ownership  of  various  other  precincts  in  Hebron.  While  political  and  security  realities  in  the  current  environment  may  obscure  certain  facts  and  their  implications,  there  is  an  interesting  technical  difference  between  the  Jewish  claim  to   certain  properties  in  Hebron  and   much  of  what  is  deemed  Jewish  settlement  in  our  traditional  homeland  —  Judea,  Samaria  and  even  Israel  proper.   Much  of  the  development  that  has  taken  place  in  both  urban   and  rural  environments  across  Israel  has  occurred  on  land  recently  acquired  by  the  Jewish  National  Fund  or  on  state  lands  leased  or  sold  for  designated  purposes.  Only  a  very  limited  amount  of  Jewish  development  in  the  older  towns  is  based  on   longstanding  freehold  ownership  arising  from  transfer  of  a  tabah   —  the  ancient  Ottoman   equivalent  of  a  registered  title   deed.   The  fact  that  much  Jewish  development  has  occurred  on  state  land  has  left  an  opening  for  denial  of  the  right  to  that  land  by  those  who  deny  the  right  of  the  Jewish  State  to  exist  They  even  refuse  to  recognise  the  United  Nations  acceptance  of  Israel  as  heir  to  the  British  Mandate  —  the  legal  heir  to  Ottoman  rule.   Not  so  in  regard  to  Jewish  ownership  of  the  existing  Jewish  precincts  in  Hebron  —  and,  for  that  matter,  various  properties  not  currently  utilised  by  Jewish  settlers  (including  the  area  occupied  by  the  central  vegetable  market,  which  is  a  freehold  owned  by  Lubavitch).  Some  of  these  have  been  in  continuous  Jewish  occupation  for  much  of  the  millennium,  while  others  (especially  those  in  Lubavitch  ownership)  were  acquired  during  the  19th  century  or  not  later  than   the  first  decade  of  the  20th  century.   The  Wakf  (Muslim  religious  authority)  and  Hebron  municipal  authorities  know  full  well  their  status  in  law.  These  Jewish   precincts  would  even  be  recognised  as  Jewish  under  the   so-called  Palestinian  Covenant   which,  although  it  denies  Jewish  rights  to  our  land,  accepts  those   Jews  and  their  institutions  whose   arrival  in  Israel  preceded  the  Balfour  Declaration  of  November  1917.   That  being  so  it  is  ironic  that  since  the  Six-Day  War  there  has  been  so  much  negativity  by  successive  Israeli  governments  towards  Jewish  resettlement  in  Hebron.  Long  before  the  contemporary  level  of  security   concerns  became  an  unfortunate   reality  —  and  even  whilst  Israel’s  victory  worried  older  Arab  residents  that  Israel  would   avenge  the  pogroms  of  1929  —  the  Israeli  military  government  of   Hebron  refused  to  countenance  Jewish  settlement  there.   Here  is  not  the  place  to  detail  the  long  struggle  by  those  devoted  to  the  cause  before  they  were  finally  allowed  to  re  establish  the  age-old  Jewish  presence  that  had  only  been  extinguished  by  violence  and  murder.  Suffice  to  say  that  a  different  approach  on  behalf  of  the  authorities  in  earlier  decades  may  have  resulted  in  a  lesser  Jewish/Arab  imbalance  in  the  town.  This  in  turn  would  have  meant  a  much  less  untenable  situation  than  that  currently  in  place  where  a  few  hundred  Jews   in  scattered  enclaves  are  effectively  besieged  by  the  violently  anti-Israel  population  of   the  town.   In  a  historical  context,  the  Jewish  relationship  to  Hebron  owes  much  to  those  who  braved  their  lives  to  settle  this  holy  site.  As  was  the  wish  of  Joshua  and  Calev  when  sent  to  spy  on  the  land  by  Moses,  may  the  merit  of  those  buried  in  Hebron  assist  us  to  overcome  all  adversaries  in  the  Holy  Land.

"  ?   A  socialist  perspective   by  Tess  Lee  Ack   The  Palestinian  masses  are  fighting  back  against  the  state  of  Israel  which  stole  their  land  and  has  oppressed  them  for  over  fifty  years.  It's  David  versus  Goliath:  thanks  to  US  aid,  Israel  is  the  most  heavily  armed  state  in  the  Middle  East,  and  it  is  using  guns,  tanks,  helicopters  and  missiles  against  a  people  armed  for  the  most  part  only  with  stones  and  bare  hands  -  plus  a  lot  of  courage  and  determination.  The  casualties  of  the  conflict  are  almost  entirely  Palestinian.  The  first  thing  that  socialists  say  is  that  we  support  the  struggle  of  the  Palestinians  unconditionally.  And  despite  the  casualties,  it  is  a  good  thing  that  they  are  fighting  back.  The  alternative  is  to  accept  defeat  -  to  give  up  the  fight  for  self-determination  and  basic  human  rights,  to  allow  thousands  of  refugees  to  continue  to  rot  in  the  camps.  The  current  conflict  was  not  ""started  by  the  Palestinians"",  as  the  Israeli  government  and  its  apologists  in  the  West  would  have  you  believe.  It  was  deliberately  orchestrated,  sparked  by  a  ""visit""  to  Jerusalem's  Temple  Mount  by  Ariel  Sharon,  accompanied  by  a  thousand  troops.  Sharon  is  the  leader  of  the  hard  right  Likud  party,  which  has  always  opposed  any  concessions  to  the  Palestinians.  He  is  infamous  for  organising  the  slaughter  of  hundreds  of  Palestinian  refugees  in  the  Sabra  and  Chatila  camps  during  Israel's  invasion  of  Lebanon  in  1982.  So  his  appearance  at  Temple  Mount  was  a  blatant  provocation.  When  Palestinians  understandably  protested,  it  gave  the  Israeli  Defence  Force  the  ""excuse""  to  start  shooting.  Nor  can  the  provocation  be  explained  away  as  a  maverick  action.  There  is  no  way  Sharon  could  have  done  it  without  the  support  of  Labor  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak.  Indeed,  Barak  is  now  talking  of  forming  a  ""government  of  national  unity""  with  Sharon.  Moreover,  Israel's  claim  on  Temple  Mount  is  completely  new,  brought  up  only  since  the  Camp  David  negotiations  in  July  this  year.  But  then,  the  ""peace  process""  has  always  been  a  farce,  and  has  delivered  nothing  to  most  Palestinians.  The  Israeli  army  still  occupies  large  areas  of  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza,  supposedly  the  basis  of  a  new  Palestinian  state,  and  Jewish  settlements  in  Arab  areas  continue  unabated.  The  Camp  David  talks  between  Barak  and  Yasser  Arafat  broke   down  because  Israel  refused  to  make  concessions  to  legitimate  Palestinian  demands.  Barak  is  trying  to  achieve  through  force  what  he  failed  to  win  at  the  negotiating  table.  But  Arafat  and  the  leadership  of  the  Palestinian  Authority  are  also  to  blame.  The  concessions  they  have  made  during  and  since  the  Oslo  conference  seven  years  ago  have  only  encouraged  Israel  to  make  new  demands,  as  with  Temple  Mount.  The  intifada  (uprising]  that  led  to  the  Oslo  negotiations  was  wound  back  -  yet  it  was  only  this  mass,  collective  defiance  that  forced  Israel  onto  the  back  foot.  In  the  absence  of  that  struggle,  Israel  regained  the  upper  hand.  Many  Palestinians  are  now  thoroughly  disillusioned  with  Arafat  and  the  ""peace  process"".   Unfortunately  some  have  turned  to  Islamic  fundamentalist  organisations  like  Hamas,  which  takes  a  more  militant  stand  against  Israel  and  the  US.  The  narrow,  undemocratic  nationalism  of  these  organisations  (along  with  the  generally  reactionary  character  of  Islamic  fundamentalism)  will  prove  as  much  of  a  dead-end  as  the  corrupt  Arab  leaders  to  whom  Arafat  has  always  looked  for  support.  They  have  all  betrayed  the  Palestinians  at  one  time  or  another.  Yet  there  are  some  heartening  signs.  For  the  first  time  in  many  years,  Arab  Israelis  -  Christian  and  Muslim  -  are  joining  the  protests.  Although  they  have  Israeli  citizenship,  they  are  second  class  citizens,  barred  from  many  jobs  and  from  living  in  predominantly  Jewish  areas  and  suffering  daily  racism  and  discrimination.  And  there  has  been  an  explosion  of  anger  across  the  region,  with  solidarity  actions  in  Jordan  (the  largest  demonstration  in  ten  years),  Lebanon  (a  general  strike  in  the  camps),  Egypt  and  other  centres.  It  is  the  region's  working  class,  overwhelmingly  sympathetic  to  their  cause,  that  the   Palestinians  need  to  Photographed  by  look  to  as  the  only  force  BBC  World  Service  capable  of  winning  justice.  Ultimately  it  is  a  class  struggle  between  the  mass  of  workers  and  the  poor  of  the  whole  region  on  the  one  hand  and  the  rulers  of  Israel  (and  their  US  backers)  and  the  Arab  states  on  the  other.  Despite  the  mythology   promoted  by  Israel's  supporters,  the  establishment  of  Israel  in  1948  had  nothing  to  do  with  providing  a  safe  haven  for  Jews.  Both  the  US  and  Britain  turned  Jewish  refugees  from  Europe  away.  The  reality  is  that  Israel  was  set  up,  funded  and  armed  to  be  a  watchdog  for  US  interests  in  the  region,  a  project  that  required  the  bloody  eviction  of  Palestinians  from  their  homeland.  As  long  as  this  fundamental  injustice  is  not  addressed,  Palestinian  resistance  will  continue.

"  Stop  the  farce  over  Jerusalem  —  Olmert   Stefan  Bialoguski   ISRAEL  cannot  count  on  the  international  favour  elicited  by  its  generous  bargaining  position  at  Camp  David  lasting,  Jerusalem  Mayor  Ehud  Olmert  said  in  Sydney  last   week.   Instead,  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak’s  unique  and  ample  concessions  opened  the  way  for  increased  pressure  on  Israel  to  con   cede  even  more.   In  Sydney  for  the  Olympic  Games,  Mr  Olmert  is  regarded  as  one  of  Likud’s  poten  tial  contenders  for  Prime  Minister.  He  voiced  support  for  Mr  Barak  before  the  last  election,  but  the  Labour  Prime  Minister’s  offer  to  cede  Israeli  authority  over  portions  of  Jerusalem  had  forced  the  capital’s  mayor  to  change  his  position.   “Are  we  after  peace  at  any  price?  We  want  peace,  we’re  yearning  and  fighting  for  peace  and  dreaming  of  peace  all  these  years  —  but  there’s  a  point  beyond  which  we  won’t  go.  There  are  certain  fundamental  truths  that  we  can’t  afford  to  compromise,  and  one  of   these  is  Jerusalem.   “The  Palestinians  believe  that  if  the  most  sacred  place  in  Jewish  history,  the  place  that’s  been  the  focus  of  all  that  we  have  been  praying  and  fighting  and  living  for  all  our  lives,  if  that  can  be  taken  from  us,  there’s  no  end  to  what  can  be  taken  from  us.”   In  a  passionate  speech  that  emphasised  •  the  continuous  centrality  of  Jerusalem  to  Jewish  life,  Mr  Olmert  argued  that  the  Palestinians  had  failed  at  Camp  David  to  grasp  a  “unique  window  of  opportunity  ...   Jerusalem  Mayor  Ehud  Olmert  with  Shlomtt  Nlrf  who  represented  Israel  as  a  swimmer  at  tne  Olympics  m  mexico  wxy  ...  ...  —...   that  would  have  provided  them  with  a  lot  more  than  they  could  legitimately  have  dreamed  of  a  few  years  ago”.   “No  Prime  Minister  in  the  history  of  Israel  was  as  generous  to  the  Palestinians  as  Barak.  No  Prime  Minister  ever  proposed  such  compromises  and  concessions  on  the  crucial  issues  as  he  did,  and  I  doubt  that  there  will  ever  be  a  Prime  Minister  in  the  future  who  will  have  the  authority  and  cir  cumstances  to  be  as  generous  as  he  was  —  including  Barak.  [The  Palestinians’  failure]  to  seize  it  shows  that  they  are  after  some  thing  that  is  not  a  real,  genuine  reconcilia  tion  with  the  Israeli  people.”   Although  international  public  opinion  swung  towards  Israel  in  the  wake  of  Camp  David,  Mr  Olmert  warned  that  this  more  positive  portrayal  would  be  shortlived.  “This  impression  of  the  world  which  presently  doesn’t  put  all  the  pressure  on  our  shoulders  is  temporary.  It  may  last  two  weeks  or  two  months,  but  after  that,  what  will  they  say  to  Barak?  That  you  agreed  to  hand  over  the  Christian  and  Muslim  quar   ters  [of  the  Old  City]  to  the  Palestinians,  and  now  they  also  want  the  Armenian  quar  ter  and  they’re  ready  to  give  you  an  under  ground  passage  to  the  Kotel.  Why  won’t  you  agree?  And  they  will  say  ‘Don’t  be  stubborn,  don’t  be  intransigent,  carry  on  in  the  same  spirit  of  flexibility  and  generosity  you  showed  at  Camp  David’.  And  suddenly  all  this  sympathy  and  image  of  Israel  as  posi  tive  and  the  Palestinians  as  negative  will  disappear  and  we  will  be  faced  by  the  fur  ther  concessions  we’re  making  and  the  lack  of  understanding  as  to  why  we  won’t  go  any   further.”   NSW  B’nai  B’rith  chairman  Ernie  Friedlander  asked  whether  internationalis  ing  East  Jerusalem  was  not  a  feasible  option  for  negotiations.   Mr  Olmert:  “I  don’t  draw  distinctions  between  East  and  West  [Jerusalem].  I  look  at  the  prayer-books  of  1500  years  ago,  and  I  don’t  see  that  Jews  were  praying  for  the  west  of  Jerusalem  and  not  for  the  east.”   With  so  many  variables  affecting  the  peace  process,  including  the  weakness  of   the  Israeli  Government  and  the  forthcoming  US  presidential  elections,  Mr  Olmert  was  hesitant  in  predicting  the  future  course  of  events,  although  he  was  doubtful  that  the  renewed  talks  would  deliver  any  tangible  results.  But  he  was  certain  of  one  point:  “The  Temple  Mount  will  remain  in  the  hands  of  the  Jewish  people  and  the  State  of  Israel.  The  city  will  be  open  to  all  believers.  We  will  continue  to  conduct  ourselves  with  gen  erosity,  understanding  and  respect  for  the  believers  of  other  religions,  but  the  political  sovereignty  will  be  in  the  hands  of  the  Jewish  people  and  the  State  of  Israel.   “What  can  you  find  in  the  ground  of  Jerusalem  that  tells  something  of  Palestinian  history?  Nothing.  And  they  are  fighting  as  if  Jerusalem  is  everything.  It’s  all  fake,  it’s  all  artificial  and  the  time  has  come  for  us  to  put  it  in  the  most  blunt  way  to  stop  this  farce.”   Mr  Olmert  was  addressing  a  meeting  organised  by  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  Zionist  Federation  of  Australia   and  NSW  State  Zionist  Council.

"  THE  Nation  of  Islam  has  a  well-documented  history  of  virulent   antisemitism.  Its  leader,  Reverend  Louis  Farrakhan,  is  responsible  for  scurrilous  remarks  about  Catholics,  gays,  whites  in  general  and  Jews  in  particular.  He  repeatedly  raises  the  canard  of  Jewish-conspiracy  theories,  accusing  Jews  of  controlling  government,  media,  banks  and  arms-manufacturing  companies,  as  well  as  of  having  played  a  major  role  in  the  slave  trade.  God,  in  fact,  is  so  appalled  by  their  insidiousness  that  African  Americans  have  superseded  them  as  His  Chosen  People,  Farrakhan  claims.   Why  is  this  relevant  today?  Because  it  serves  as  a  litmus  test  of  just  how  out  of  touch  the  new  President  of  the  United  States  is  regarding  issues  which  fall  beyond  his  sphere  of  immediate  con  cern.  Interviewed  on  the  Fox  network  during  the  election  cam  paign,  George  W  Bush  made  the  preposterous  statement  that  the  Nation  of  Islam  follows  principles  of  love.  Asked  whether  he  believed  it  to  be  based  on  faith,  he  replied:  “I  think  it  is.  I  think  it’s  based  upon  some  universal  principles,  such  as  ‘love  your  neigh  bour  like  you’d  like  to  be  loved  yourself’.”   A  few  weeks  later,  Bush  signed  a  proclamation  declaring  a  spe  cific  day  to  be  Jesus  Day  in  Texas  —  a  violation  of  the  separation  of  Church  and  State,  and  a  slight  on  the  millions  of  Texans  who  are  Jewish,  Buddhist,  Muslim,  members  of  other  faiths  and  non-believ  ers.  The  remark  followed  an  observation  that  only  Christians  go  to   Heaven.   The  bottom-line  question  is  —  will  George  Walker  Bush  be  good  for  the  Jews?  Or,  according  to  the  sub-text,  will  there  be  a  replay  of  the  strained  relations  between  Washington  and  the  Jews,  and  between  Washington  and  Jerusalem,  which  marked  the  administra  tion  of  his  father,  George  Herbert  Bush?   It  is  a  reflection  of  Bush’s  parochial  worldview  that  as  an  adult  he  has  left  the  United  States  just  three  times,  and  that  he  is  an  unknown  quantity  outside  the  US.  Indeed,  until  the  election,  he  was  an  unknown  quantity  within  the  US.  The  scant  information  that  was  available  showed  that  Texas,  of  which  he  was  Governor,  had  the  second-worst  standards  of  education,  environment  and  health  care  in  the  US.  It  showed  that  he  had  been  in  politics  for  barely  six  years  (compared  with  the  26  of  his  rival,  A1  Gore,  who  had  served  as  sen  ator,  congressman  and  Vice-President).   Bush’s  malapropisms  likewise  do  not  augur  well  for  preten   sions  to  statesmanship.  He  expressed  affection  for  Slovenia  while  addressing  a  representative  of  Slovakia;  he  wants  good  relations  with  the  “Grecians”;  he  intends  to  monitor  the  “East  Timorians  and  Kosovians”;  and  he  believes  in  a  “foreign-handed  foreign  policy”  when  addressing  “globic”  issues.   Another  Republican  recently  took  office  with  minimal  knowledge  of  the  world  beyond  the  Hudson  River,  and  that  was  Ronald  Reagan  —  on  whom  Bush  models  his  public  persona  —  yet  he  was  credit  ed  with  a  successful  administration.  Reagan  surrounded  himself  with  a  strong  cabinet,  and  Bush,  to  his  credit,  is  doing  likewise.   He  is  marshalling  experienced  ministers  and  foreign  policy  advis  ers,  many  of  them  senior  personnel  in  his  father’s  administration  and  two  of  them  veterans  of  the  1991  Gulf  War:  Vice-President  Dick  Cheney  was  a  capable  Defence  Secretary,  while  the  highly  respect  ed  General  Colin  Powell,  who  was  Chief  of  the  US  Armed  Forces,  is  the  new  Secretary  of  State.  With  Vietnam  War  hero  John  Cain  expected  to  be  Defence  Secretary,  it  is  shaping  up  as  a  conserva  tive  administration  —-  which  will  be  cautiously  welcomed  by  many  Jews  who  felt  that  Bill  Clinton  pushed  Israel  too  hard  and  too  far.   There  is  concern,  however,  over  what  role  he  will  give  James  Baker,  who  was  a  key  man  in  the  Bush  team  during  the  Florida  vote  wrangling,  and  who  is  regarded  as  hostile  to  Israel  —  a  legacy  of  his  term  as  Secretary  of  State  under  Bush  Senior.   Bush’s  victory  means  the  end  of  Joe  Lieberman’s  current  aspira  tions  to  be  Vice-President.  There  are  many  among  the  Jewish  com  munity  who  will  be  relieved  —  a  reflection  of  the  discomfort  they  felt  when  Ed  Koch  was  Mayor  of  New  York.  Keen  to  demonstrate  his  impartiality,  Koch  over-compensated  for  his  Jewishness  by  leaning  too  far  in  the  other  direction,  some  believed,  and  yet  at  the  same  time  undue  attention  was  paid  to  his  Jewishness,  so  it  proved  to  be   a  lose-lose  situation.   Interestingly,  the  fact  that  there  was  a  Jewish  candidate  on  the  Democratic  ticket  made  no  difference  to  the  Jewish  vote:  Gore  Lieberman  received  79  percent  of  it  —  about  the  same  figure  that  Clinton  received  in  1992  and  1996.  Bush  received  19  percent.   Bush  is  not  expected  to  devote  nearly  as  much  energy  to  the  Middle  East  as  Clinton  did;  it  is  an  area  of  foreign  policy  in  which  he  is  completely  untested.   It  is  hoped,  however,  that  the  man  who  has  inherited  the  mantle  of  leader  of  the  free  world  is  astute  enough  to  acquire  an  under  standing  of  the  issues.  His  advisers  can  only  offer  advice;  ultimate  ly,  he  will  have  to  rely  on  himself  to  make  critical  decisions. ",2000-12-22
"  Israeli  newspapers  report  the  death  of  Syrian  President  Hafez  al-Assad.   Photo:  Isranet   Steadfast  foe  leaves  unfinished  legacy   NEW  YORK:  After  US  Secretary  of  State  Henry  Kissinger  negotiated  the  ceasefire  that  ended  the  1973  Yom  Kippur  War,  he  tried  to  set  up  a  region  al  peace  conference.   But  he  found  that  Syrian  President  Hafez  al-Assad  had  no  intention  of  tak  ing  part  in  a  meeting  on  a  comprehen  sive  settlement  with  Israel.  It  was  not  to  be  the  last  time  that  the  United  States  and  Israel  had  their  hopes  raised  and  then  dashed  by  Assad,  who  died  on  Saturday  at  the  age  of  69.   Assad’s  death  leaves  Israel  and  the  Jewish  world  without  its  most  elusive  and  implacable  adversary,  a  dictator  as  respected  for  his  political  skills  as  he  was  opposed  for  his  views.  It  also  marks  the  end  of  an  era  of  secular  Arab  leaders  whose  careers  were  fuelled  by  the  military  and  financial  support  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  shaped  by  the  ideas  of  Arab  national  ism  and  staunch  anti-Zionism.   Indeed,  one  of  Assad’s  first  goals  when  he  came  to  power  in  a  bloodless  coup  in  1970  was  to  erase  the  memo  ry  of  the  Arab  world’s  humiliating  defeat  to  Israel  in  the  1967  Six-Day   War.   Assad  served  as  Syria’s  Minister  of  Defence  in  that  war,  during  which   Israel  captured  Jerusalem,  the  Sinai  Desert,  the  West  Bank,  Gaza  Strip  and  the  Golan  Heights,  which  Syria  had  controlled.  Along  with  Egyptian  President  Anwar  Sadat,  who  had  not  yet  become  the  peacemaker  for  which  he  is  remembered,  Assad  used  the  Cold  War  to  his  country’s  advantage.  He  received  military  support  and  advice  from  the  Soviet  Union.   But  Assad  failed  to  achieve  his  aims  in  the  1973  war.  During  the  next  quar  ter-century,  as  Sadat,  Palestinian  leader  Yasser  Arafat  and  King  Hussein  of  Jordan  reached  agreements  with  Israel,  Assad  refused  to  do  so.  As  Assad  maintained  his  grip  on  power   by  running  a  police  state,  cracking  down  on  dissidents  and  rivals  for  power  with  no  concern  for  human  rights,  he  also  carved  out  a  role  as  a  major  player  in  the  Middle  East,  par  ticularly  in  the  areas  of  international   terrorism  and  control  over  Lebanon.   After  Iran’s  Islamic  Revolution  in  1979,  Assad  allied  with  the  fundamen  talist  leaders  of  Iran  in  aiding  interna  tional  terrorists  against  Israel.   Syria,  which  is  on  the  US  list  of  state  sponsors  of  terrorism,  supported  the  Abu  Nidal  group.  The  group  carried  out  a  string  of  attacks  in  the  1980s,  including  attacks  at  El  A1  counters  in  Rome  and  Vienna  in  1985.  The  Damascus-Teheran  alliance  also  gave  supplies  and  training  to  Hezbollah  gunmen  who  fought  to  push  Israel  out  of  Lebanon.  Assad  lived  just  long  enough  to  see  success  on  the   Southern  Lebanon  front.   Syria  views  Lebanon  as  part  of  its  country,  unfairly  separated  by  European  colonists.  It  first  intervened  in  1975,  during  the  beginning  of  a  com  plicated  and  bloody  civil  war  involv  ing  Lebanese  Christians  and  several  disparate  Lebanese  Muslim  groups,  as  well  as  the  Palestine  Liberation   Continued  page  38   Unfinished  legacy   Continued  from  page  14   Organisation,  which  had  set  up  headquarters  there  following  the  group’s  expulsion  from  Jordan  in  1970.   Assad,  who  believed  that  the  Arab  world  needed  to  boost  its  military  capability  if  it  was  to  have  a  chance  against  Israel,  did  not  respond  when  Israel  invaded  Lebanon  in  1978.  In  1982,  Israel  again  invaded  its  northern  neighbour  in  an  attempt  to  reduce  Syrian  influence  and  eliminate  the  PLO.  After  Israel  withdrew  to  a  14-kilmetre  security  zone  in  Southern  Lebanon  in  1985,  Assad  moved  his  troops  in  and  again  became  the  main  powerbroker  there.   In  the  early  1990s,  Assad  appeared  to  shift  course.  After  years  of  repression  against  the  Syrian  Jewish  community,  he  opened  the  doors  to  secret  Jewish  emigration—as  long  as  the  emi  gres  did  not  go  to  Israel.  In  an  operation  engi  neered  by  the  Jewish  Agency,  1300  Jews  left  Syria.  Now,  fewer  than  200  Jews  remain.   At  the  same  time,  Assad  allowed  for  his  coun  try’s  participation  in  the  1991  Madrid  Peace  Conference,  which  marked  the  beginning  of  the  current  Middle  East  process.  Negotiations  between  Israel  and  Syria  occurred  during  the  reign  of  Yitzhak  Rabin,  with  Israel  allegedly  agreeing  to  give  up  the  Golan  Heights  in  return  for  a  full  peace.  But  negotiations  broke  off  in  1996  after  Syria  refused  to  condemn  a  series  of  Hamas  suicide  bombings  carried  out  in  Israel.   As  late  as  last  year,  when  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  and  Assad  exchanged  mutual  words  of  praise  for  each  other,  prospects  for  peace  between  Israel  and  Syria  appeared  bright.  The  recent  round  of  talks,  however,  yielded  no  results  and  Assad  was  criticised  for  sending  his  Foreign  Minister  to  negotiate  with  Israel,  rather  than  going  himself.   With  his  death,  Assad’s  legacy  is  unfinished.  He  met  Israel  on  the  battlefield  and  more  tenta  tively  at  the  negotiating  table.  But  he  left  the   issue  of  peace  for  his  son  Bashar.   JTA ",2000-06-16

"  Israeli  Arabs  becoming  more  radicalised   GH  Sedan   UMM  EL-FAHM,  Israel:  The  rally  looked  as  if  it  could  have  been  held  in  downtown  Teheran,  not   in  the  heart  of  Israel.   Hundreds  of  cars,  filled  with  bearded  men  and  scarfed  women,  headed  towards  Umm  el-Fahm,  the  second-largest  Arab  town  in  Israel  after  Nazareth.  It  is  also  a  stronghold  of  the  Islamic  Movement  —  a  political  grouping  that  has  a  growing  following  in  the  Israeli  Arab  community.   The  cars  were  arriving  for  the  movement’s  fifth  annual  rally,  which,  like  the  ones  in  previous  years,  focused  on  obtaining,  and  maintaining,  an   Islamic  hold  on  Jerusalem.   The  issue  of  Jerusalem,  which  prevented  Israel  and  the  Palestinians  from  reaching  a  peace  accord  at  July’s  Camp  David  summit,  was  the  focus  of  militant  rhetoric  at  the  rally,  which  took  place  at  Umm  el-Fahm’s  “Peace  Stadium”.   The  35,000-seat  stadium  filled  up  soon  after  prayers.  Latecomers  were  turned  away  for  lack  of  seats.  Thanks  to  a  sophisticated  public  address  system,  the  speeches  resounded  over  the  hills  surrounding  the  stadium,  reaching  hun   dreds  of  homes.   The  speakers  at  the  rally  sent  a  loud  and  clear  message:  While  Israel  is  busy  trying  to  reach  a  historic  compromise  with  Palestinian  Authority  President  Yasser  Arafat  regarding  Jerusalem,  the  Islamic  Movement  will  never  compromise  when  it  comes  to  the  Holy  City.  When  it  comes  to  the  Al-Aksa  Mosque  on  the  Temple  Mount,  they  said,  there  can  be  no  flexibility.  This  prompted  the  crowd  to  chant  repeatedly:  “In  spirit  and  blood,  we  shall  redeem  Al-Aksa”.   A  huge  model  of  the  mosque—which  is  third  in  religious  importance  to  the  holy  shrines  at  Mecca  and  Medina  within  the  Islamic  world  —  stood  on  the  stage  of  the  stadium.  Chains,  rep  resenting  Zionist  shackles,  surrounded  the  model,  which  was  topped  with  a  weeping  eye  —  symbolising  Palestinian  tears.   As  in  previous  years,  the  rally  was  held  under  the  slogan  “The  Al-Aksa  Mosque  Is  in  Danger”.   “Even  giving  up  one  stone  of  Al-Aksa  means  giving  up  all  of  Al-Aksa,”  declared  Sheikh  Raed  Sal  ah  Mahajneh,  Mayor  of  Umm  el-Fahm  and   leader  of  the  Islamic  Movement  in  Israel.  “Giving  up  even  one  piece  of  earth  equals  giving  up  all  of   Al-Aksa.”   According  to  Mahajneh,  the  Islamic  world  has  exclusive  rights  to  all  holy  sites  in  Jerusalem  —  and  Israel  has  none.  For  years,  he  has  railed  against  successive  Israeli  governments  for  con  fiscating  the  lands  of  Israeli  Arabs  and  under  mining  Muslim  rights  to  holy  sites  on  Jerusalem’s  Temple  Mount.  While  he  has  never  been  suspected  of  involvement  in  actions   Our  gravest  mistake  was  the  support  we  gave  Ehud  Barak   in  the  last  elections.”   against  the  Jewish  State,  he  has  also  never  called   for  Jewish-Arab  coexistence.   Mahajneh  has  been  a  driving  force  behind  Islamic  construction  projects  on  the  Temple  Mount  in  recent  years  —  projects  carried  out  despite  the  protests  of  archaeologists  who  main  tain  that  the  work  is  causing  damage  to  the  site.   In  his  speech,  he  charged  that  Israel  was  dam  aging  the  Al-Aksa  Mosque,  which  prompted  the   Israeli  daily  Ma’ariv  to  criticise  his  “incendiary”  rhetoric.  In  an  editorial,  Ma’ariv  said:  “It  is  doubt  ful  whether  any  leader”  of  the  Islamic  Movement  “believes  that  Israel  really  intends  to  harm  Islamic  holy  sites”.  But,  it  continued,  this  did  not  deter  the  speakers  at  the  rally  “from  inflaming  the  masses  with  the  promise  to  ‘spill  blood,  not  tears’,  if  Israel  dares  to  ‘touch  the  stones  of  the  mosque’.”  It  is  no  wonder,  it  wrote,  that  Mahajneh  and  his  friends  are  “accused  of  incite   ment  and  divisiveness”.   The  rally  took  place  at  the  end  of  a  tense  week  in  relations  between  Israeli  officials  and  Israeli   Arabs.  Days  before  the  rally,  the  police  announced  that  they  had  arrested  12  residents  of  Umm  el-Fahm  for  weapons  possession  and  for  conspiring  to  kill  Arabs  they  suspected  of  col  laborating  with  Israel.   However,  after  a  widely  publicised  press  con   ference  in  which  the  chief  of  the  Northern   Command  of  Israel’s  police  force  depicted  the  group  as  potential  terrorists,  the  charge  sheets  revealed  a  different  picture.  According  to  the  documents,  the  12  were  linked  to  the  under  world,  suspected  of  having  set  afire  three  homes  and  a  business  to  avenge  the  murder  of  a  rela  tive.  A  cache  of  arms  that  the  police  uncovered  was  apparently  intended  for  ordinary  criminal,  not  political,  purposes.   In  the  eyes  of  the  Islamic  Movement,  this  was  proof  that  the  authorities  were  harassing  the  group’s  followers.  They  made  similar  accusa  tions  after  police  asked  the  Attorney-General  to  press  charges  against  two  Israeli  Arab  Knesset  Members  —  Mohammed  Barakah  of  the  Hadash  Party  and  Abdulmalik  Dehamshe  of  the  United  Arab  List  —  for  calling  on  Israeli  Arabs  to  forcibly  resist  any  effort  to  demolish  Arab  homes  deemed  illegal  by  the  authorities.  Israeli  Arab  leaders  charged  that  this  was  a  deliberate  campaign  against  them,  orchestrated  by  Alik  Ron,  the  commander  of  the  police  force’s  Northern  Command.   “Our  gravest  mistake  was  the  support  we  gave  Ehud  Barak  in  the  last  elections,”  said  Mahajneh.   Apparently,  a  growing  number  of  Israeli  Arabs  are  feeling  equally  frustrated.  Israel  Television  recently  publicised  a  survey  showing  that  a  third  of  Israel’s  Arabs  do  not  believe  that  they  should  be  loyal  to  the  state.   Israeli  policymakers,  although  alarmed,  are  trying  to  find  a  course  of  action  to  deal  with  such  expressions  of  militancy.  “One  needs  to  cope  with  the  roots  of  the  matter,”  said  Science  Minister  Matan  Vilnai,  who  heads  a  government  committee  on  Arab  affairs.  He  suggested  that  the  government  should  make  a  wholehearted  effort  to  improve  the  standard  of  living  of  the  Arab  population  in  Israel  —  a  move  he  said  would  pull  the  rug  out  from  under  the  Islamic   Movement’s  rhetoric.   In  a  rare  expression  of  self-criticism,  Deputy  Defence  Minister  Ephraim  Sneh  said  no  Israeli  Government,  except  for  that  of  Prime  Minister  Yitzhak  Rabin,  dealt  seriously  with  the  problems  of  Israel’s  Arabs.

"  Sydney  Jewry  targtfed   Staff  Reporters   CENTRAL  Synagogue  was  threatened  by  a  group  of  men  in  traditional  Arab  attire,  a  homemade  bomb  was  hurled  at  the  succah  of  a  prominent  Sydney  rabbi,  a  firebomb  was  thrown  at  the  synagogue  of  the  National  Jewish  Centre  in  Canberra,  and  young  people  were  chased  on  their  way  home  from  a  Sydney  synagogue  by  Arabic-speak  ing  youths.   The  incidents,  which  all  occurred  last  weekend,  took  place  as  violent  confrontations  between  Israeli  sol  diers  and  Palestinians  entered  their  third  week.   In  other  incidents,  several  organisa  tions  have  received  emails  referring  to  “you  filthy  Jew  animals”,  “Jew  Pigs”  and  “yid  bastards”;  members  of  South  Head  and  Adass  Synagogues  have  been  subjected  to  anti-Jewish  and   “Attacks  on  Jewish  people  and  institutions  by  supporters  of  the   Palestinian  cause  represent  a  disturbing  introduction  of   political  violence  to  Australia.”   anti-Israel  taunts,  and  had  bottles  and  other  objects  thrown  at  them  while  walking  to  synagogue;  a  group  tried  to  paste  signs  on  Central  Synagogue’s  doors  advertising  a  Palestinian  rally;  and  a  bomb  scare  caused  the  evacua  tion  of  Masada  Primary  School.   Palestinian  Authority  representa  tive  in  Australia  Ali  Kazak  suggested  that  members  of  the  Jewish  commu  nity  committed  the  bomb  outrages  against  themselves  in  order  to  dis  tract  attention  from  the  crimes  which  he  accused  Israel  of  committing.   Federal  police  are  searching  for  the  would-be  terrorists  who  attempted  to  fire-bomb  the  synagogue  at  Canberra’s  National  Jewish  Centre.  Police  believe  assailants  attempted  to   lob  one,  or  possibly  two,  Molotov  cocktails  into  the  synagogue  through  a  window  in  an  attack  which  appeared  to  support  Palestinian  violence  in   Israel.  Fire  bums  to  the  wall  and  a  win  dow  indicate  that  a  bomb  narrowly  missed  smashing  through  a  window  into  the  synagogue,  where  it  would  have  caused  extensive  damage.   Community  member  David  Rosalky  raised  the  alarm  after  arriving  for  a  Succot  service.  Detective-sergeant  Steve  Mullins  said  forensic  experts  had  found  debris  by  the  synagogue  wall  consistent  with  a  device  similar  to  a  Molotov  cocktail.  Police  would  be  conducting  a  thorough  investigation,  and  were  upgrading  security,  he  said.  While  forensic  experts  sifted  bomb  debris,  members  of  the  AFP  bomb  squad  examined  the  building  to  ensure  there  were  no  other  explosive   devices.   In  Sydney,  two  carloads  of  men  in  Arab  dress  went  to  Central  Synagogue  on  Sunday  evening  and  threatened  to  return  with  guns  when  the  security  guard  requested  them  to  leave.  “They  approached  the  synagogue  in  a  man  ner  that  was  suspicious  and  threaten  ing,”  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman  said.  “When  the  security  guard  asked  them  to  move  on,  a  man  got  out  in  a  threat  ening  manner,  and  I  believe  the  secu  rity  guard  drew  his  gun.  The  man  in  the  car  said  something  to  the  effect  of  coming  back  later  with  guns.  The  police  were  called.”   Earlier,  a  homemade  bomb  was  thrown  at  the  succah  of  Yeshiva  spiri  tual  dean  Rabbi  Pinchus  Feldman  while  50  guests  were  inside.  “Thank  God,  nobody  was  hurt,”  he  said.   Police,  who  believe  two  men  seen  in  the  area  might  be  able  to  assist  with  inquiries,  have  appealed  for  informa  tion.  “The  device  hit  concrete  paving  and  was  extinguished,”  a  spokesman   Continued  page  40   Sydney  Jewry  targeted   Continued  from  page  1   said.  “Police  seized  a  number  of  items  for  foren  sic  examination.”   Mr  Rothman  denounced  the  actions  as  un   Australian  and  pleaded  for  calm.  “Attacks  on  Jewish  people  and  institutions  by  supporters  of  the  Palestinian  cause  represent  a  disturbing  introduction  of  political  violence  to  Australia,”   he  said.   On  Saturday  evening,  young  people  returning  from  an  eastern  suburbs  synagogue  were  chased  by  a  group  of  Arabic-speaking  people  shouting  anti-Israel  and  anti-Jewish  insults.  “The  kids  had  to  go  over  a  fence  to  escape  and  no-one  was  hurt,”  Mr  Rothman  said.  “I  have  also  heard  rumours  of  other  similar  incidents.   “The  situation  requires  far  greater  discipline  than  has  been  shown  by  the  leaders  of  the  Arab  community,”  he  said.  “They  need  to  ensure  that  whatever  tensions  exist  in  the  Middle  East  are  not  translated  into  acts  of  violence  in  Australia.  The  most  disturbing  aspect  of  this  is  that  it  puts  multiculturalism  in  Australia  on  trial  in  a  big  way.  While  local  ethnic  groups  have  the  right  to  sup  port  issues  in  their  country  of  origin,  the  resort  to  violence  in  Australia  is  totally  inexcusable.”   Police  have  called  for  anyone  who  might  have  witnessed  the  attacks  to  contact  Crime  Stoppers  at  1800  333  000.   The  Middle  East  conflict  has  also  spawned  antisemitic  emails,  calls,  postings  on  internet  message  groups  and  posters  at  university  cam   puses.   An  email  by  “Simon  Godslayer”  sent  to  JET,  the  young  adult  arm  of  the  B’nai  B’rith  anti  defamation  unit,  stated:  “My  thoughts  and  prayers  go  out  to  the  People  of  Palestine,  who  have  been  slaughtered  by  you  filthy  Jew  animals  for  far  too  LONG!!!  How  you  people  can  justify  the  massacre  of  unarmed  civilians  including  women  and  children  with  heavy  artillery  is  incomprehensible...   “You  people  are  nothing  more  than  the  living,  breathing  defecation  that  has  putrified  this  earth  for  thousands  of  years.”   Police  forensic  experts  check  the  fire-scorched  Canberra  synagogue  for  clues.   A  similar  message  posted  on  the  newsgroup  “aus.religion.islam”  and  aus.religionJudaism”  called  “Australian  Arab  brothers”  to  arms:  “It  is  time  we  taught  these  Jew  Pigs  a  lesson.  We  are  meeting  in  the  city  at  4pm  Tuesday  to  march  on  the  Jew  Pig  consulate.  BYO  rocks.  We  will  then  go  to  Bondi  and  put  the  wind  up  the  yid  bas   tards.”   Posters  featuring  the  Israeli  flag  and  Nazi  flag  and  asking  “What  is  the  difference?”  have  appeared  at  the  University  of  NSW,  “authorised  and  supported”  by  a  group  calling  itself  Everyaction.   Extreme  left-wing,  Palestinian  and  Muslim  groups,  which  are  anti-Israel  and  have  antisemit  ic  connotations,  have  met  on  university  cam  puses,  Australasian  Union  of  Jewish  Students  national  president  Toby  Mittelman  said.

"  SteSisai  BiaiogjusSti   A  WRONGLY-captioned  photograph  published  by  the  New  York  Times  and  Melbourne’s  Herald-Sun  is  being  held  up  as  an  example  of  the  mainstream  media’s  assumptions  concerning  vio  lence  in  Israel.   Depicting  an  injured  youth  and  a  club-wielding  Israeli  policeman,  the  photograph  was  captioned  “An  Israeli  policeman  and  a  Palestinian  on  the   Temple  Mount”  by  the  New  York  Times  and  other  dailies  in  the  US.  The  Hemld-Sun  published  the  same  pic  ture  on  its  front  page—a  day  after  the  New  York  Times  had  printed  a  correc  tion  —  with  the  caption  “Bashed:  an  American  student  is  beaten  by  an  Israeli  police  officer  in  Jerusalem”.   In  fact,  the  Associated  Press  photo  graph  is  of  an  Israeli  soldier  trying  to   defend  Jewish  student  Tuvia   Grossman,  of  Chicago,  from  a   Palestinian  mob  near  a  petrol  station  outside  the  Old  City.  The  mob  had  attacked  Mr  Grossman’s  taxi,  pulled  him  and  two  friends  out  of  the  car  and  beat  and  stabbed  them.   In  a  letter  to  the  New  York  Times,  Grossman’s  uncle,  Howard  Gissinger,  cited  the  photograph  as  an  example  of  cliched  portrayal  of  the  conflict.   “Since  the  Times  wishes  to  convey  the  belief  that  the  Palestinians  are  all  innocent  lambs  being  tormented  by   an  aggressive  oppressor,  it  can  not  even  conceive  that  the  wounded  and  injured  are  NOT  Palestinians  ...  [Tuvia]  was  not  in  ‘crossfire’,  but  merely  the  target  of  Palestinian  lambs  who  stoned  his  cab,  dragged  him  from  the  vehicle,  smashed  his  head  with  stones  and  stabbed  him  in  the  leg,”  he  wrote.  Tuvia’s  only  crime,  he  added,  was  being  Jewish.   Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs   Continued  page  16   The  photograph  and  caption  as  they  appeared  In  the  HeraldSun.   When  assumptions  miss  the  mark   Continued  from  page  1   Council  executive  director  Dr  Colin  Rubinstein  commented:  “The  Herald-Sun  picture  is  symp  tomatic  of  the  rush  to  judgment  and  prejudg  ment  of  responsibility  for  the  violence.  It  rein  forces  a  stereotype  which  defies  the  reality.  Reinforcement  of  this  stereotype  has  proceed  ed  apace  in  recent  days.”   Herald-Sun  deputy  editor  John  Trevorrow:  “The  caption  that  came  with  the  picture  was  extremely  ambiguous.  It  named  the  guy  from  Chicago  and  said  he  was  with  an  Israeli  police  man  after  being  beaten.  We  may  have  made  an  assumption  that  may  not  have  been  right.  I’m  trying  to  get  to  the  bottom  of  it.  If  someone  has  made  a  mistake,  we  will  issue  a  correction.”   The  following  day,  the  Herald-Sun  published  a  paragraph  at  the  end  of  a  250-word  story  on  page  35,  stating  that  the  picture  was  “incor  rectly  captioned.  The  student  was  injured  by  Palestinian  attackers,  not  by  an  Israeli  police  officer”.   ALIAC  director  of  international  affairs  Jeremy  Jones:  “It  defies  belief  that  the  Herald-Sun  editor  believes  that  this  paragraph  would  in  any  way  undo  the  graphic  image  so  falsely  misidentified  in  the  previous  day’s  newspaper”.   Tuvia  Grossman  was  released  from  a  hospi  tal  on  October  4,  but  returned  there  after  faint  ing  the  next  day,  according  to  the  Israeli   Consulate  in  New  York.   Andrea  Levin,  executive  director  of  the  Boston-based  Committee  for  Accuracy  in  Middle  East  Reporting  in  America,  said  “honest  mistakes”  are  made  “in  the  heat  of  the  moment”,  but  the  fact  that  so  many  editors  seized  on  this  photograph  reflected  “ingrained  assumptions”  about  the  nature  of  clashes  in  Israel,  fulfilling  “the  perception  of  what  is  hap  pening  there  —  that  there  is  only  one  victim,  the  Palestinian”.   In  its  correction,  the  New  York  Times  attrib  uted  the  mistake  to  “erroneous  identification”.   Dr  Rubinstein  said  the  violence  had  started  with  the  murder  of  two  Israeli  soldiers—one  in  a  bomb  attack,  the  other  shot  by  an  Arab  col  league  in  a  Palestinian-Israeli  security  patrol.  The  following  day,  Likud  leader  Ariel  Sharon  paid  his  controversial  visit  to  Judaism’s  holiest  site,  the  Muslim-administered  Temple  Mount;  and  the  next  day,  Jews  at  the  Western  Wall  were  stoned.  Violence  then  erupted  in  Gaza,  Judea   and  Samaria,  with  the  active  participation  of  armed  Palestinian  police  and  the  Tamzin  Palestinian  youth  movement.   “The  Palestinians’  rifles,  machineguns  and  Molotov  cocktails  have  almost  been  eliminated  from  the  media’s  perception  in  their  coverage,”  Dr  Rubenstein  said.  “There’s  been  a  bit  of  bal  ance  here  and  there  ...  it’s  not  universally  unbalanced  coverage.”   Although  he  appeared  on  ABC  Radio’s  World  Today,  Dr  Rubinstein  was  concerned  that  the  next  day  the  program  hosted  director  of  the  Centre  for  Arab  and  Islamic  Studies  at  the  Australian  National  University,  Professor  Amin  Saikal,  with  leading  member  of  the  Australian  Arabic  Communities  Council,  Khaldoun  Hajaj,  with  no  alternative  opinions.   Professor  Saikal,  a  specialist  on  Aghanistan,  told  the  program  that  the  “Palestinian  side...  is  full  of  —  made  up  of  —  largely  unarmed  pro  testers”.  He  was  thanked  for  his  “wisdom  and  observations”  by  presenter  John  Highfield.   But  it  was  Mr  Hajaj’s  comments  which  par  ticularly  troubled  Dr  Rubinstein,  saying  some  of  them  came  close  to  vilification.  Mr  Hajaj  was  introduced  as  a  Palestinian  and  an  academic  at  the  University  of  NSW.  He  claimed  that  cease  fire  agreements  with  Israel  were  not  worth  the  paper  they  were  written  on,  and  that  Israel  con  tinued  to  bomb  Lebanon  “just  about”  daily.   As  for  the  violence:  “We  have  had  50  years  of  persecution,  oppression,  murder  and  mas  sacres.  Palestinians  can  take  that  no  longer,  and  it’s  a  natural  reaction  that  they  would  revolt  in  the  manner  in  which  they  do.”   The  journalist  interviewing  him,  Rachel  Mealey,  characterised  the  violence  as  being  “fought  between  Palestinian  civilians  and  pro  fessionalised  Israeli  Defence  Force  operatives”.   Mr  Highfield  told  the  AJN  that  the  program  had  tried  to  strike  a  balance  between  differing  points  of  view,  and  had  interviewed  “two  rea  sonably  prominent  people  from  the  Jewish  community”  during  the  week:  Dr  Rubinstein   and  an  academic  from  Melbourne  University.   “Obviously,  over  the  course  of  one  program,  it’s  very  difficult  to  [strike  a  balance],  but  over  a  period  of  programs  that  is  what  we  try  to  achieve.  We  take  no  position  on  the  difficulties  [in  Israel],  other  than  to  reflect  the  different  views  and  interpretations.  We  leave  people  to  make  up  their  own  minds  from  what  they  hear.” ",2000-10-13
"  Why  this  war  had  no  name   THOMAS  FRIEDMAN   MAYBE  the  most  revealing  feature  of  the  latest  explosion  in  Israeli  Palestinian  violence  is  the  fact  that  this  war  had  no  name.  The  intifada  —  the  Palestinian  uprising  of  the  late  1980s,  got  its  name  almost  immedi  ately.  Intifada  loosely  means  “shak  ing  off,  and  Palestinians  were  said  to  be  trying  to  shake  off  the  Israeli  occupation.  The  name  made  so  much  sense  that  even  Israelis  used  it.  But  the  violence  of  the  last  month  still  has  no  name.  And  that  is  not  an  accident.  It’s  because  even  the  par  ticipants  can’t  explain  what  it’s  about,  or,  deep  down,  they’re   embarrassed  to  do  so.   Here’s  why:  The  roots  of  this  lat  est  violent  outburst  can  be  traced  directly  back  to  US  President  Bill  Clinton’s  press  conference  after  the  breakdown  of  the  Camp  David  sum  mit.  At  that  time,  Mr  Clinton  point  edly,  deliberately  —  and  rightly  —  stated  that  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  had  offered  unprece  dented  compromises  at  the  summit:  more  than  90  percent  of  the  West  Bank  for  a  Palestinian  state,  a  partial  resolution  of  the  Palestinian  refugee  problem  and  Palestinian  sovereignty  over  the  Muslim  and  Christian  quar  ters  of  the  Old  City  of  Jerusalem  —   and  that  Yasser  Arafat  had  not  responded  in  kind,  or  at  all.   Palestinians  were  shocked  by  Mr  Clinton’s  assessment.  For  the  first  time  in  a  long  time,  Mr  Arafat  no  longer  had  the  moral  high  ground.  He,  and  the  Arab  leaders,  had  grown  so  comfortable  with  Bibi  Netanyahu  as  Prime  Minister  of  Israel  —  a  man  the  world  always  blamed  for  any  peace  breakdown  —  that  they  were  stunned  and  unprepared  for  the  seriousness  of  Mr  Barak’s  offer  and  the  bluntness  of  Mr  Clinton’s  assess  ment.  Other  world  leaders  told  Mr  Arafat  the  same  thing:  Barak  deserves  a  serious  counter-offer.   Palestinians  bum  an  Israeli  flag  during  the  current  unrest  In  the  West  Bank.   Photo:  JTA   Mr  Arafat  had  a  dilemma:  make  some  compromises,  build  on  Mr  Barak’s  opening  bid  and  try  to  get  it  closer  to  100  percent  —  and  regain  the  moral  high  ground  that  way  —   The  iron  fist  is  not  a  sustainable  solution  for  a  state  of  six  million  Jews  living  in  a  sea  of  one  billion  angry  Muslims.   or  provoke  the  Israelis  into  brutalis  ing  Palestinians  again,  and  regain  the  moral  high  ground  that  way.  Mr   Arafat  chose  the  latter.  So  instead  of   responding  to  Mr  Barak’s  peacemak  ing  overture,  he  and  his  boys  responded  to  Ariel  Sharon’s  peace  destroying  provocation.  In  short,  the  Palestinians  could  not  deal  with  Barak,  so  they  had  to  turn  him  into  Sharon.  And  they  did.   Of  course,  the  Palestinians  could   n’t  explain  it  in  those  terms,  so  instead,  they  unfurled  all  the  old  complaints  about  the  brutality  of  the  continued  Israeli  occupation  and  settlement-building.   Frankly,  the  Israeli  checkpoints  and  continued  settlement-building  are  oppressive.  But  what  the   Palestinians  and  Arabs  refuse  to   acknowledge  is  that  today’s  Israeli  Prime  Minister  was  offering  them  a  dignified  exit.  It  was  far  from  perfect  for  Palestinians,  but  it  was  a  propos  al  that,  with  the  right  approach,  could  have  been  built  upon  and  widened.  Imagine  if  when  Mr  Sharon  visited  the  Temple  Mount,  Mr  Arafat   had  ordered  his  people  to  welcome  him  with  open  arms  and  say  “When  this  area  is  under  Palestinian  sover  eignty,  every  Jew  will  be  welcome,  even  you,  Mr  Sharon”.  Imagine  the  impact  that  would  have  had  on   Israelis.   But  that  would  have  been  an  act  of   statesmanship  and  real  peaceful  intentions,  and  Mr  Arafat,  it’s  now  clear,  possesses  neither.  He  prefers  to  play  the  victim,  rather  than  the  statesman.  This  explosion  of  vio  lence  would  be  totally  understand   able  if  the  Palestinians  had  no  alter  native.  But  that  was  not  the  case.   What’s  new  here  is  not  the  vio  lence,  but  the  context.  It  came  in  the  context  of  a  serious  Israeli  peace  overture,  which  Mr  Arafat  chose  to  spurn.  That’s  why  this  is  Arafat’s  war.  That’s  its  real  name.   If  you  want  to  know  how  confused   the  Palestinians  are,  consider  this  quotation  from  their  senior  negotia  tor,  Hasan  Asfour:  “There  can  be  no  [resumption  of]  peace  talks  without  an  international  investigation  [into  the  latest  violence].  Our  people  did  not  die  for  nothing.”   I  see.  These  Palestinians  died  so  there  can  be  an  international  investi  gation  into  why  they  were  killed.  Sad.  What  a  totally  messed-up  set  of  priorities.   “Basically,”  said  Stephen  P  Cohen,  a  Middle  East  expert  at  the  Israel  Policy  Forum,  “the  Arabs  and  Palestinians  have  spent  so  many  years,  and  used  up  so  much  energy,  from  1967  to  2000,  just  getting  to  the  point  where  they  would  make  peace  with  Israel  if  they  got  100  percent  of  what  they  wanted,  that  they  have  no  energy  now  to  fight  the  real  battle,  which  is  getting  their  people  to  accept  90  percent.  The  danger  —  if  we  don’t,  despite  everything,  still  find  a  way  to  erect  a  peace  —  is  that  the  only  energy  left  will  be  with  those  who  want  to  undermine  every  thing.”   With  the  gleeful,  savage  mob  mur  der  of  Israeli  soldiers  in  Ramallah,  on  top  of  the  Israeli-Palestinian  killings  and  the  suicide  attack  on  a  US  ship  in  Yemen,  the  whole  region  is  coming  unglued.  What’s  scary  is  that  no-one  knows  what  to  do  next.  Moderates  cannot  continue  to  argue  that  if  Israel  went  far  enough,  it  would  have  a  Palestinian  partner.  But  the  hardliners,  now  saying  “I  told  you  so  —  the  iron  fist  is  the  only  way  to  deal  with  the  Palestinians”,  are  peddling  a  fantasy  as  well.  The   iron  fist  is  not  a  sustainable  solution   for  a  state  of  six  million  Jews  living  in  a  sea  of  one  billion  angry  Muslims.   So  what  do  you  do  when  there  is  no  partner  for  peace  and  no  alterna  tive  to  peace?  Mourn  the  dead.  Mourn  the  dead  and  pray  that  after  this  explosion  of  hatred  is  over,  the  parties  will  find  a  way  to  live  apart.  Otherwise  the  future  is  just  endless  killing  and  dying,  killing  and  dying,  killing  and  dying,  killing  and  dying,  killing  and  dying,  killing  and  dying.

"  Khatami  in  US;  Iran  10  appeal  postponed   Michael  Jordan   NEW  YORK:  The  waiting  game  con  tinues  in  Iran,  as  the  judiciary  there  has  postponed  at  least  for  another  week  a  decision  in  the  appeals  of  10  Iranian  Jews  convict  ed  on  charges  of  spying  for  Israel.   The  delay  is  ostensibly  because  the  three  judges  reviewing  the  appeals  are  divided  on  whether  the  charges  of  which  the  Jews  were  convicted  actually  constitut  ed  a  crime.   But  few  observers  doubt  that  domestic  Iranian  politics  are  at  play.  If  anything,  they  say,  the  delay  undermines  the  efforts  by  Iranian  President  Mohammad  Khatami  to  spruce  up  his  image  as  a  reformer  and  to  bolster  his  claim  that  he,  not  the  Islamic  fundamen  talists,  is  truly  in  control  of  his  country.   The  delay  also  did  nothing  to  defuse  a  flurry  of  street  protest  and  behind-the-scenes  diplomacy  that  greeted  Khatami  as  he  and  150  other  heads  of  state  arrived  in  New  York  for  the  UN  Millennium  Summit.   Jewish  groups  sponsored  two  media  events  just  blocks  away  from  the  United  Nations,  while  an  Iranian  exile  organisation  held  an   anti-Khatami  demonstration  with   in  earshot  of  visiting  dignitaries   from  around  the  world.   “We  cannot  tolerate  a  situation   where  it  is  a  crime  simply  for  being  Jewish,”  said  New  York  Governor  George  Pataki,  who  headlined  a  rally.  “Mr  Khatami,  to  you,  your  parliament  and  your  judiciary,  human  rights  and  digni  ty  must  be  the  right  of  every  citi   zen.  You  claim  to  be  a  reformer:  show  it  and  release  these  10.”   Convicted  on  July  1,  the  10  Jews  have  already  served  some  18  months  in  prison.  Their  sentences   range  from  four  to  13  years,  but  US  Jewish  leader  Malcolm  Hoenlein  says  his  sources  indicate  that  sev  eral  more  may  be  released,  with  jail  terms  reduced  for  the  rest.  But  he  wouldn’t  bank  on  it.   As  delaying  the  appeals  decision  demonstrates,  said  Hoenlein,  “the  only  thing  predictable  about  Iran  is  that  nothing  is  predictable”.   Thus,  the  need  to  prod  Khatami,  both  publicly  and  privately.  Hoenlein,  who  met  Iran’s  Parliament  Speaker  last  week,  still  holds  out  hope  that  he  will  be  able  to  plead  his  case  directly  to   Khatami.   From  the  Jewish  side,  Hoenlein  conceded  there  was  internal   debate  on  whether  a  meeting  with   Khatami  in  New  York  would  be  manipulated  by  the  Iranian  media  for  domestic  consumption.  Hoenlein  said  a  meeting  would  only  take  place  if  Jewish  leaders  were  guaranteed  their  say.  In  the  end,  that  point  was  moot  because   American  Jewish  leaders  weren’t  invited.  “We  should  meet  with   Khatami  to  send  the  right  message  that  the  appeals  should  succeed  and  security  guaranteed  for  the  entire  Jewish  community,”  Hoenlein  said.   The  rally  was  staged  outside   Iran’s  Mission  to  the  United   Nations  —  but  some  question  what  impact  these  events  have,  except  to  draw  the  media.  Soon  after  Pataki  had  left  the  event,  more  than  a  dozen  speakers  from  across  the  political  and  religious  spectrums  followed  him  to  the  podium.  They  firmly  but  politely  intoned  about  human  rights,  the  rule  of  law,  sanctions  against  Iran  and  the  country’s  continued  isola  tion  from  the  world.  Yet  their  voic  es  rarely  rose  above  the  din  of  roaring  buses  and  trucks  nearby.   The  glaring  exception  was  Max   American  Jews  demostrate  against  the  imprisonment  of  ten  Iranian  Jews.   Photo:  ST  A   Saatchi,  an  Iranian  emigre  who  stood  beside  the  podium  and  held  high  a  placard  of  the  10  impris  oned  Jews  —  sitting  in  the  Iranian  courtroom,  heads  bowed,  in  prison-issue  grey  flannel  uniforms.  After  each  speaker,  Saatchi,  whose  father  is  Jewish  and  mother  Muslim,  and  says  17  relatives  have  been  executed  for  anti-regime  activities,  thrust  his  hand  in  the  air  and  repeatedly  shouted:  “Terrorist  Khatami  out  of  UN!”  or  “No  appeasement  with  mullahs!”   Before  his  arrival,  Khatami  had  met  with  members  of  Iran’s  Jewish  community,  which  numbers  27,000  and  is  steadily  shrinking;  included  the  Jewish  member  of  parliament   in  Iran’s  official  delegation;  and  announced  plans  to  host  a  “Dialogue  on  Civilisations”  panel.   Saatchi  was  unimpressed.  “Khatami  is  a  terrorist,  like  the  rest  of  them,”  he  said.  “He’s  a  wolf,  but  they  present  him  as  a  lamb.”   An  hour  later,  there  was  a  rally  by  Iranian  Americans,  several  thousand  marching  through  the  streets,  banging  drums,  chanting  through  bullhorns  and  waving  the  green,  white  and  red  flag  of  Iran.  The  Iranians  seemingly  have  been  champing  at  the  bit  to  vent  at  Khatami.  Last  week,  posters  began  appearing  around  the  city,  depict  ing  Khatami  “the  terrorist”  with  fangs  and  bulging  eyes.  Four  Iranians  were  reportedly  arrested  in  separate  incidents  for  throwing  yellow  paint  at  Khatami’s  entourage  and  elsewhere.  Yellow,  said  activists,  is  “the  colour  of  dis  may,  the  colour  of  disapproval”.   On  the  arrests  and  trial  of  the  Jews,  however,  non-Jewish  Iranian  Americans  have  been  notably  silent.  In  part,  they  say,  it’s  been  due  to  a  lack  of  organisation  and  the  fact  that  the  community  has  yet  to  find  its  political  voice.  Nevertheless,  last  week  may  have  marked  a  watershed  moment.  Several  at  the  protest,  organised  by  the  Paris-based  National  Council  of  Resistance  of  Iran,  spoke  out  about  the  trial,  describ  ing  it  as  a  transparent  attempt  to  frighten  the  masses  and  impose   conformity  on  all  Iranians.  They  also  noted  Iran’s  financial  support  and  training  for  terrorist  groups  like  Hamas  and  Hezbollah.   Charges  of  espionage  are  a  “typ  ical  punishment  for  those  the  regime  wants  to  discredit”,  said  Mitra  Bagheri.  “I  don’t  think  peo  ple  in  Iran  believe  anything  the  government  says  because  it  tells  big  lies,  and  the  truth  is  always  the  other  way  around.”   Says  Anahita  Sami,  18,  the  move  against  Iran’s  Jews  is  part  of  the  campaign  against  all  of  Iran’s   minorities.  “It’s  obvious  the  Jews  were  not  guilty  of  anything,”  said  Sami,  a  student  at  George  Washington  University.  “This  is  happening  to  innocent  Iranians  all  the  time.  They  want  to  control  people  through  the  word  of  God,  and  to  keep  the  pressurecooker  from  exploding  by  brainwashing   them.”   Another  activist  cautioned   Americans  not  to  judge  all  Iranians  by  the  current  regime.  “One  thing  has  to  be  made  clear,”  said  Kasra  Nejat,  president  of  the  Iranian   American  Cultural  Association  of  Missouri:  “the  Iranian  Government,  the  supreme  leaders  —  the  whole  system  is  corrupt.  It  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  Iranian  people.  That’s  why  we’re  here,  because  this  government  doesn’t  represent  real  Iranians.”   JTA ",2000-09-15

"  UlcSiairril  Ms®  1k®m®   LONDON  —  British  Jewish  leaders  are  relieved  at  the  failure  of  a  Muslim  campaign  aimed  at  unseating  pro  Israel  legislators.   Votesmart,  a  website  run  by  Mus  lim  volunteers,  campaigned  against  a  number  of  legislators  who  belong  to  Labour  Friends  of  Israel,  a  lobbying  bloc  associated  with  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair’s  victorious  governing   party.   All  the  targeted  candidates  won  re-election  in  the  7  June  general  elec  tion,  many  by  larger  margins  than  in  the  last  elections  in  1997.   “The  Muslim  campaign  had  no  effect  at  all,”  said  Barry  Kosmin,  director  of  London’s  Institute  for  Jew  ish  Policy  Research,  a  think  tank.   Votesmart’s  emphasis  on  Pales  tine,  to  the  exclusion  of  all  other  issues  during  the  campaign,  proved  ineffective,  Kosmin  said.   “Foreign  policy,  and  especially  Palestine,  doesn’t  play  any  role  in  British  elections,”  he  said.   Mike  Whine,  a  spokesman  for  the  Community  Security  Trust  (CST),  an  organisation  that  deals  with  Jewish  security  issues,  agreed.   “The  election  seems  to  suggest  that  Muslim  voters  are  more  con  cerned  with  national  issues  [than  for  eign  ones],  which  is  to  be  welcomed,”   he  told  JTA.   Mike  Gapes,  a  target  of  Votesmart,  said  the  campaign  may  actually  have   backfired.   Gapes,  the  vice-chairman  of  Labour  Friends  of  Israel,  was  rated  a  minus  five  —  the  lowest  possible  rat  ing  —  on  Votesmart’s  online  guide.   Despite  the  rating,  he  said,  “I  had  very  large  support  from  Muslims  in  my  community.   “Quite  a  lot  of  Muslims  decided  they  wanted  nothing  to  do  with  this  and  campaigned  for  me,”  he  said.   The  Muslims  affiliated  with  the  site  campaigned  so  heavily  against  Gapes  that  on  one  occasion  police  were  called  in  to  keep  peace  between  the  lawmaker’s  supporters  and  his  opponents,  he  said.   The  British  National  Party  captured  16.4  per  cent  of  the  vote  in  Oldham  West  —  the  best-ever  result  for  a  far   right  party  in  England   “They  campaigned  outside  mosques  and  on  polling  day  at  polling  stations,”  which  is  against  the  law,  Gapes  said.  Police  ordered  the  Mus  lim  campaigners  to  move  away  from  the  polling  station.   While  pro-Israel  activists  are   pleased  by  the  overall  result  —  a  repeat  of  Labour’s  landslide  1997  vic  tory  —  there  is  concern  about  the  success  of  the  far-right  British  Nation  al  Party  in  the  north  of  England.   The  British  National  Party  cap   tured  16.4  per  cent  of  the  vote  in  Old  ham  West—the  best-ever  result  for  a  far-right  party  in  England  —  and  11  per  cent  in  neighbouring  Oldham   East.   A  depressed  industrial  town,  Old  ham  East  was  the  scene  of  riots  between  Muslims  of  Pakistani  origin  and  white  residents  in  the  past  few  months.   “Oldham  shows  the  effect  a  racist   party  can  have  on  a  despondent  elec  torate,”  the  CSTs  Whine  said.   One  of  the  country’s  most  promi  nent  Jewish  politicians,  former  For  eign  Secretary  Sir  Malcolm  Rifkind,  failed  to  recapture  the  Edinburgh  seat  he  lost  to  Labour  in  1997.

"  News   Funds  to  aid  Muslim  community,  but  not  the  Jews   Chanfal  Abitbol   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman  has  taken  issue  with  the  State  Government  for  failing  to  assist  the  Jewish  community  with  funds  to  upgrade  security  measures  in  the  wake  of  the  unprecedented  number  of  antisemitic  incidents  this  year.   He  was  commenting  in  the  wake  of  an  announcement  by  the  Depart  ment  of  Community  Services  (DoCS)  that  it  has  allocated  grants  totalling  $30,000  to  assist  communities  —  and  the  Muslim  community  in  particular  —  in  dealing  with  the  aftermath  of  the  September  11   terrorist  attack  on  the  US  .   According  to  its  announcement,  the  DocS  grant  is  designed  to  counteract  “the  impact  on  Muslim  communities  of  reactions  to  the  terrorist  attacks  and  their  aftermath”,  and  to  counter  the  impact  on  “children,  families  and  communities  of  increased  stress   and  feelings  of  insecurity  caused  by  violent  media  images  and  traumatic   events”.   The  one-off  grants  will  be  allocated  in  amounts  of  up  to  $1000  and  will  cover  a  range  of  services,  including  community  meetings  and   translation  services.   While  Mr  Rothman  emphasised  that  he  “deplores  any  attacks  on  Muslim  communities”  and  “applauds  any  steps  by  government  to  overcome  racially  motivated  attacks”,  he  expressed  frustration  at  the  apparent  oversight  when  it  came  to  the  Jewish  community.   “The  Jewish  community  has  been  subjected  to  far  more  significant  attacks  over  a  longer  period  [than  the  Muslim  community],  and  it’s  disappointing  that  the  government  has  not  offered  assistance  to  combat  this  issue,”  he  said.  “Discussions  calling  for  heightened  security  for  Jewish  institutions  and  individuals  have  thus  far  resulted  in  no  positive  commitment.   “To  be  fair,”  he  added,  “the  Jewish  community  is  better  able  to  deal  with  these  issues  because  of  its  longer  history  in  dealing  with  antisemitic  conduct,  but  we  do  require  some  amelioration.”   Defending  the  allocation  of  the  grants,  a  DoCS  spokesperson  said  the  purpose  was  to  provide  aid  to  the  general  public,  not  just  to  the  Muslim  community.   “By  helping  parents  understand  how  difficult  it  is  for  children  and  young  people  to  assimilate  the  media  images,  and  by  promoting  a  greater  understanding  of  the   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman   cultural  issues  at  community  level,  it  is  expected  that  some  of  the  secondary  impacts  of  events  can  be  ameliorated,”  she  said.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  expressed  concern  that  highlighting  the  violence  perpetrated  against  the  Muslim  community  could  “misrepresent”  the  totality  of  the  issue,  ignoring  security  threats  against  other  groups.   “We’re  concerned  when  people  present  this  as  an  issue  only  in   relation  to  attacks  on  mosques,”  he  said.  “There  have  also  been  attacks  on  churches  and  synagogues  in  the  past  year.”   The  ECAJ  recently  issued  a  report  which  placed  the  acts  of  antisemitism  in  Australia  this  year  at  an  all-time  high.   Between  1  October,  2000  and  30  September,  2001,  the  recorded  incidence  of  assault,  arson  attacks  and  vandalism  on  Jewish  institutions  was  “60  per  cent  above  average  and  more  than  10  per  cent  above  the  previous  year”.   “The  community  has  been   subjected  to  far  more   attacks;  it’s  disappointing  the  government  has  not  offered   assistance.”   In  New  South  Wales,  165  incidents  which  qualify  as  “racial  violence”  according  to  the  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunities  Commission  were  reported,  while  the  national  figure  was  361.   Among  the  most  disturbing   events  were:  a  series  of  firebomb   attacks  at  a  synagogue  and  community  centre,  including  a   firebomb  attack  while  people  were  on  the  premises;  a  series  of  assaults  on  young  men,  one  of  whom  required  surgery;  petrol  bombs  thrown  at  the  homes  of  religious  leaders;  the  smashing  of  windows  at  synagogues  and  other  communal   institutions.   Pointing  out  that  each  community  experiences  acts  of  violence  differently  and  should  not  be  compared,  Mr  Jones  added:  “I  don’t  think  it’s  useful  to  contrast  the  experiences  of  Muslims  to  Jews  to  Aborigines.  In  the  Jewish  community,  antisemitic  acts  are  likely  to  be  construed  as  acts  of  extremists,  rather  than  representative  of  change  in  tone  of  Australian  society,  whereas  in  the  Muslim  community,  hate  acts  might  be  regarded  differently  because  of  their  own  experiences  of  Australian  society.”   Rather  than  DoCS  awarding  grants  aimed  at  supporting  multicultural  education  and  activities,  he  said,  the  provision  of  effective  security  for  communal  facilities  was  of  more  immediate  concern  to  the  Jewish  community.   “We’ve  not  had  a  single  perpetrator  charged  with  damage  to  a  Jewish  institution  or  brought  to  justice.  That’s  our  top  priority.” ",2001-12-21

"  A  SHEEP  being  fattened  up  for  sacri  ficial  slaughter  in  early  March  to  mark  the  Muslim  holiday  of  Eid  al   Adha  has  caused  the  death  of  its  owner  in  Egypt  in  bizarre,  but  trag   ic  circumstances.

"  Camaraderie  for  Aussie  Muslims   IN  THE  past  couple  of  weeks  I  have  seen  a  lot  of  stupid  things  :  said  about  Muslims,  including  Muslim  soldiers  currently  serving   in  the  Army.  Fortunately  I  haven't  seen  much  in  my  unit,  but  the  attitudes  I  have  seen  &gt;  expressed  by  others,  especially  in  the  ;  wider  community,  have  been  appalling.  ;  At  the  politest,  there  is  an  assump-  ;  tion  that  they  are  security  liabilities.  At  the  worst,  it  is  sheer  ratbaggery.  In  the  war  against  terrorism,  Islam  is  not  the  enemy  -  only  terrorists.  The  Taliban  and  other  terrorists  have  about  as  much  relationship  to  Islam  as  IRA  bombers  have  to  Roman  Catholicism.  Within  units,  padres  or  Muslim  members  might  be  able  to  help  with  a  basic  explanation  of  what  Islam,  is  about.  Service  newspapers  could  also  .  explain  some  of  the  cultural  and  faith-  related  issues.  Finally,  familiarisation  training  in  the  culture  and  faiths  of  our  major  neighbours  as  part  of  training,  such  as  in  staff  courses  for  officers,  would  also  be  of  some  benefit.  Not  only  would  it  help  prevent  divisive  and  ignorant  harassment  of  Muslims,  it  would  also  enhance  our  ability  to  work  with  other  nations  and  deal  with  the  civilian  communities  of  countries  where  we  could  serve.

"  Sonia  Humphry   A  FEDERAL  MP  has  called  on  moderate  Australian  Muslims  —  and  on  the  entire  Australian  community  —  to  shun  the  Grand  Mufti  of  Australia’s  Muslim  community,  Sheikh  Tajeddin  Hilaly  of  Lakemba.   Describing  him  as  “the  immoderate  voice  of  Islamism  in  Australia”  and  a  “tremendous  embarrassment”,  Christopher  Pyne,  Federal  Member  for  Sturt,  South  Australia,  said:  “Sheikh  Hilaly  should  be  isolated  by  the   moderate  Muslim   community  and  by  moderate  Muslim   leadership.  They   should  become  their   own  spokespeople.   “Sheikh  Hilaly  should  be  shunned  by  them,  and  equally  by  the  rest  of  the  Australian  community.  The  Muslim  leadership  in  Adelaide  thinks  Hilaly  is  giving  the  Muslim  community  a  bad  name.”   Christopher  Pyne   Mr  Pyne,  who  last   week  addressed  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council,  said  “there  doesn’t  seem  to  be  enthusiasm”  for  the  “moderate  Muslim   leadership  to  speak  out  against  Sheikh  Hilaly”.   He  praised  Melbourne  Sheikh  Fehmi  and  the  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria  for  having  “the  courage  to  speak  out  against  Islamism  and  its  threat  to  core  Australian  values”,  and  said  there  are  many  Australian  Muslims  who  would  be  better  representatives  than  Sheikh  Hilaly.   “I  don’t  think  the  sheikh  does  represent  the  Muslim  community,”  he  said.  “I  think  he  represents  a  very  small  sector,  but  because  of  seniority,  age  and  culture,  people  are  reticent  to  speak  out  against  him.   “Lakemba  is  just  one  mosque.  There  are  many  mosques  in  Australia  and  many  better  spokespeople.  The  Muslim  community  would   do  well  to  engage  those  people,  rather  than  allow  Sheikh  Hilaly  to  represent  them.”   Mr  Pyne  was  also  highly  critical  of  the  radical  Islamic  Youth  Movement,  warning  against  the  use  of  seemingly  innocuous  organisations  to  raise  funds,  recruit  people  and  distribute  propaganda  for  extremist   causes.   “Like  Hilaly,  the  Islamic  Youth  Movement  threatens  our  harmonious  multicultural  community”,  he  said,  describing  them  as  publishers  of  websites  and  a  magazine  that   advocate  terrorist   Sheikh  Hllaly   martyrdom  operations  against  the  West”  and  pointing  out  their   connection  to  a   suspected  terrorist  training  camp  south  east  of  Canberra.   Following  the  September  11  attack  on  the  US,  the  homes  of  ten  members  of  the  Islamic  Youth  Movement  were  raided  by  ASIO,  and   computer  records,   mobile  phones  and  invoices  seized,  he  said.   An  advocate  of  multiculturalism,  Mr  Pyne’s  first  experience  of  antisemitism  occurred  at  a  meeting  ten  years  ago  when  he  heard  National  Action  attack  two  Jewish  members  of  the   audience.  “I  realised  the  reason  they  were  being  shouted  down  was  because  they  were  Jewish,  and  I  thought  ‘this  is  1992,  this  is  unacceptable.  I’m  going  to  find  out  why  Jews  are  still  being  vilified  because  of  their  religion  and  their  race,  rather  than  their  views’.”   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  said  the  Jewish  community  is  still  awaiting  an  apology  from  Sheikh  Hilaly  for  highly  offensive  comments  which  he  made  13  years  ago.   “Rather  than  act  as  if  Imam  Hilaly  has  no   Continued  page  26   Continued  from  page  1   case  to  answer,  he  should  be  urged  to  honour  his  public  commitment  to  apologise  to  the  Jewish  community  for  his  outrageous  group  defamation  of  Australian  Jewry  in  1988.”   Mr  Jones  urged  government  officials  to  con  sider  that  Sheikh  Hilaly  brings  discredit  to  any  multicultural  platform  on  which  he  appears.   Mr  Pyne  said  there  is  room  for  change  in  Australian  media  coverage  of  the  Middle  East  and  local  issues  arising  from  interna   tional  conflict.   “The  ABC  is  one  of  the  worst  offenders  when  it  comes  to  the  Middle  East.  They  prob  ably  think  they’re  doing  the  right  thing.  They’re  the  first  people  to  say  Australians  deserve  to  be  able  to  make  up  their  own  mind   and  not  be  censored,  yet  they’re  the  first  to  try  and  censor  people  when  they  feel  that  fits  within  their  philosophical  position.   “Ordinary  Australians  are  pretty  sensible;  they  just  need  to  have  the  information  provid  ed  to  them  so  they  can  make  up  their  own  minds.  This  is  why  censoring  Sheikh  Hilaly’s  comments  on  suicide  bombers,  where  he  described  them  as  heroes,  by  SBS  has  serious  ramifications,  because  what  it  does  is  not  expose  him  for  the  extremist  he  is.   “It’s  dangerous  for  media  outlets  to,  if  you  like,  protect  people  from  themselves  and  not  give  the  Australian  people  the  right  to  make  their  own  assessment.  When  the  people  are  presented  with  the  facts,  they  always  make  a   sensible  decision.” ",2001-12-21
"  Hilaly  praised  suicide  bombers   Victor  Kleorekoper   THE  Grand  Mufti  of  Australia’s  Muslim  community,  Sheikh  Tajeddin  Hilaly,  praised  suicide  bombers  in  a  sermon  filmed  by  SBS  Television  before  the  September  11  terrorist  attack  on  the  United  States.   But  the  film  was  not  screened  because  SBS  felt  it  would  have  been  “misleading”  to  show  the  footage  after  the  suicide  attack  on  the  US.   In  the  sermon,  at  Lakemba  Mosque,  Sheikh  Hilaly  described  anyone  fighting  for  Islam  as  a  hero.  He  was  speaking  just  days  after  a  Palestinian  suicide  bomber  killed  15  people  in  an  attack  on  the  Sbarro  pizzeria  in  Jerusalem.   me  luuiage  was  filmed  to  accompany  a  story  which  the  SBS  TV  Insight  program  had  planned  on  can  didates  for  a  Muslim  radio  licence.   But  it  was  not  included  in  the  program,  screened  on  September  20,  which  changed  tack  after  the  attack  on  the  US  and  focused  on  the  potential  for   terrorism  in  Australia.   The  excluded  film  came  to  light  after  Herald  Sun  journ  alist  Andrew  Bolt,  who  appeared  on   Double-speak?  Sheikh   Hllaly  (right)  with  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  at  an  Interfalth  function  in   Sydney  last  week.   tne  program,  wrote  about  it  on  [November  1U.   Insight  executive  producer  Lindy  Magoffin  denies  that  SBS  concealed  the  footage.   She  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  it  would  have  been  wrong  to  air  the  views  Sheikh  Hilaly  had  expressed  before  September  11,  when  he  had  spoken  out  immediately  after  September  11  condemning  the  attacks  on  the  US.   She  noted  that  on  October  25,  Insight  broad  cast  parts  of  another  interview  with  Sheikh  Hilaly,  in  which  he  criticised  Australia’s  involvement  in  the  war  on  terrorism  and  described  US  President  George  Bush  as  the  Pharoah  of  the  White  House.  He  also  said  Australian  Muslims  condemn  terrorism.   “I  reject  the  suggestion  that  we  wimped  it,”  she  said.  “To  have  broadcast  his  earlier  statements  a  month  later  without  context   would  have  been  misleading  and,  in  the  circumstances,  grossly  irresponsible.”   The  incident  has  prompted  a  strong  response  from  Jewish  leaders,  who  already  have  grave  concerns  about  Sheikh  Hilaly’s  attitude  to  the  Jewish  community.   Sheikh  Hilaly,  an  Egyptian  who  arrived  in  Australia  in  1982  on  a  six-month  visa,  has  a  history  of  preaching  against  Israel  and  has  several  times  been  accused  of  incitement  against  the  Jews.   In  1986  then-immigration  Minister  Chris  Hurford  (Labor)  moved  to  expel  him  for  visa  breaches  and  attacked  statements  said  to  be  incitements  to  hatred.   The  sheikh  was  allowed  to  stay  after  pressure  by  Labor  figures,  including  former  Prime  Minister  Paul  Keating,  whose  seat  included  the  Lakemba  Mosque  and  a  large  Muslim  population.   In  1988  there  was  renewed  pressure  to  deport  the  sheikh  after  he  gave  a  public  lecture  describing  Jews  as  “the  underlying  cause  of  all  wars  threatening  the  peace  and  security  of  the  whole  inhabited  earth”.   He  also  accused  Jews  of  using  “sex  and  abominable  acts  of  buggery,  espionage,  treason  and  economic  hoarding  to  control  the  world”.   He  later  claimed  that  he  had  been  misquoted,  but  a  translation  and  analysis  by  the  NSW  Ethnic  Affairs  Commission  confirmed  that  he  had  made  the  statements.   There  were  further  unsuccessful  attempts  to  deport  him,  and  in  1990  Sheikh  Hilaly,  now   Continued  page  34   Making  heroes  of  suicide  bombers...

As  part  of  the  conditions,  he  was  asked  to  apol  ogise  to  Australia’s  Jewish  community  for  his   remarks.   But  according  to  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  national  vice-president  Jeremy  Jones,  no  apology  has  been  forthcom  ing.   “Imam  Hilaly  has  never  retracted,  or  apolo  gised  for  comments  in  1988  found  by  the  NSW  Ethnic  Affairs  Commission  to  have  'contained  justification  of  violence  towards  the  Jews’  and  resulted  in  'disunity  and  tension’  in  Australia.   ”  “He  has  made  a  series  of  comments  since   that  time  which  indicate  he  has  not  changed  his  views  that  Jews  deserve  contempt  and  that  Australia  is  immoral  for  supporting  Israel’s   existence.   “He  is  totally  inappropriate  as  a  spokesper  son  for  communal  harmony  and  discredits  platforms  on  which  he  appears,”  Mr  Jones   said.   ECAJ  president  Nina  Bassat  said  two  issues  were  very  disturbing.   “The  first  is  the  role  played  by  Sheikh  Hilaly  since  his  arrival  in  Australia  and  the  fact  he  has  continued  his  inflammatory  comments  all  £  along.   “Of  equal  concern  is  the  fact  that  the  media  is  prepared  to  manipulate  interviews  and  films  in  such  a  manner  as  to  give  protection  and  suc  cour  to  Sheikh  Hilaly.”   Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  executive  director  Dr  Colin  Rubenstein  said   the  claim  that  SBS  had  withheld  footage  were  most  disturbing.   “If  SBS  has  this  footage  of  Sheikh  Hilaly   endorsing  suicide  bombing,  it  has  an  obliga  tion  to  show  it  with  all  appropriate  context.”   He  said  that  the  overwhelming  majority  of  Australians,  including  Australian  Muslims,  would  not  share  extreme  views  which  justify  terrorism,  and  anybody  publicly  enunciating  the  views  attributed  to  Sheikh  Hilaly  would  be  discredited  in  the  public  eye.   Sheikh  Hilaly’s  comments  in  an  Arabic  ser  mon  are  in  marked  contrast  to  the  position  he  took  last  week  when  speaking  in  English  in  the  company  of  Great  Synagogue  Senior  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  and  other  religious  leaders  at  a  function  at  Government  House  to  encourage  religious  tolerance.   The  function  was  titled  “Unity  in  Adversity”.  Rabbi  Apple  said  that  Sheikh  Hilaly  had  clearly  stated  that  peaceful  words  and  meth  ods  were  the  way  to  live  together.   “It  is  a  pity,  therefore,  that  when  addressing  his  own  constituency,  he  seems  to  prefer  more  strident  language,  publicly  lauding  suicide   bombers  as  heroes.   “There  would  be  much  more  moral  heroism  if  the  more  peaceful  parts  of  the  Koran  which  respect  Jews  and  Christians  were  reaffirmed,  if  Palestinian  aspirations  were  promoted  by  negotiation  instead  of  bellicose  rhetoric  and  acts  of  terrorism,  and  if  there  was  more  Palestinian  awareness  of  the  opportunities  they  have  squandered  and  the  efforts  they  have  failed  to  make  to  build  their  own  institu  tions.”   Tamar  Hazour,  a  board  member  of  the  Australian  Arabic  Council,  said  the  question  of  racism  and  hatemongering  had  been  taken  out  of  context,  and  extremism  existed  in  every  community.

A  new  synagogue  was  inaugurated  last  year  in  Skopje,  Macedonia,  but  it  is  located  in  the  Jewish  community  building.   “The  Mostar  synagogue  is  an  important  symbol  of  new  life  —  not  just  for  Jews,  but  for  the  whole  coun  try,”  said  Jakob  Finci,  president  of  the  Bosnian  Jewish  community.   “It  is  especially  important  that  it  is  being  built  in  a  small  town  that  was  sharply  divided  between  Mus  lims  and  Croats  and  heavily  dam  aged  during  the  war  in  the  1990s,”  he  said.  During  the  Bosnian  war,  the  cemetery  was  on  the  front-line  and  used  by  Serbs  to  shell  the  city.   Mostar’s  Jewish  community  has  only  about  45  members.  Its  leader,  Zoran  Mandlbaum,  became  a  local  hero  during  the  Bosnian  war  for  his  non-sectarian  humanitarian  work.  His  efforts  were  crucial  in  getting  the  synagogue  project  off  the  ground.   Construction  of  the  three-storey  complex  will  be  financed  by  Mostar  municipal  authorities,  who  pledge  to  complete  the  building  next  year.   The  complex  is  located  just  100  yards  from  the  site  of  the  famous  16th-century  stone  bridge  at  Mostar  that  was  destroyed  by  Croat  mortar  fire  in  November  1993.   The  bridge  is  to  be  rebuilt  under  the  auspices  of  UNESCO.  Mostar  offi  cials  say  they  hope  the  synagogue   and  bridge  can  be  inaugurated  at  the   same  time.   In  addition  to  the  synagogue,  the  Jewish  complex  will  include  a  cultur  al  centre  open  to  members  of  all   faiths.   “A  synagogue  in  itself  is  open  one  day  a  week,”  Find  said.  “But  the  cul  ture  centre  will  be  open  three  days  a  week.  We  hope  it  will  be  a  wonderful  meeting  point  for  Christians,  Mus  lims  and  Jews  to  learn  how  similar  and  close  we  are,  all  children  of  one  God.”   “The  project  is  believed  to  be  the  first  synagogue  built   from  the  ground  up  in  the   Balkans  since  World  War  II.”   Taking  part  in  the  comerstone  laying  ceremony  were  a  Serbian  Orthodox  archbishop,  the  deputy  Catholic  bishop  of  Mostar  and  an  Islamic  official,  the  chief  imam  of   Mostar.   The  ceremony  was  the  first  time   in  several  months  that  senior  offi  cials  of  Bosnia’s  three  main  religions  joined  together,  Finci  said.   In  addition,  Mostar’s  Croat  mayor  and  Muslim  deputy  mayor  attended,  along  with  a  number  of  foreign  ambassadors  and  other  senior  diplo   mats.   “It  seems  as  if  the  Jews  are  the   only  glue  that  can  bring  together  these  groups,”  quipped  one  senior  western  official  who  attended.   American  representatives  did  not  attend,  however.  This  was  because  of  a  travel  ban  to  Mostar  and  sur  rounding  areas  that  the  United  States  imposed  on  American  officials  after  violent  riots  by  Croat  extrem  ists  erupted  there  earlier  this  month.   Ironically,  the  travel  ban  prevent  ed  a  10-member  delegation  of  the  American  (JDC)  Jewish  Joint  Distrib  ution  Committee  currently  visiting  Bosnia  from  attending  the  ceremony.   JDC  officials  said  that,  as  an  American  delegation,  the  group  had  to  bow  to  the  security  directives  of   the  US  Embassy  and  State  Depart-  £   ment.   This  month’s  riots  were  the  worst  violence  in  Bosnia  since  the  1995  Dayton  Accord  ended  the  Bosnian   civil  war.   During  the  clashes,  international  officials  were  taken  hostage,  and  up  to  two  dozen  international  peace  keepers  were  injured  in  battles  with  Croat  separatists.

"  Abu  Sinan  faces  new  reality   Daniel  Ben-Tal   JERUSALEM  —  The  12,000  Muslim,  Druse,  and  Christian  residents  of  the  Western  Galilee  village  of  Abu  Sinan  were  stunned  by  the  news  that  one  of  their  neighbours,  Muhammad  Shaker  Habeishi,  was  a  suicide  bomber.  The  news  renewed  fears  of  alienation  from   the  country’s  Jewish  majority.   “We  haven’t  awakened  from   the  shock  yet,”  local  council  mem  ber  Haled  Sabah  told  the  Jerusalem  Post  on  Monday.  “I  can’t  believe  that  he  was  responsible.  We  hope  ...  that  it  wasn’t  him.”   “Nobody  understands  what  really  happened,”  said  Habeishi’s  son-in-law  Samer  Gadvan,  28.  “He  has  not  been  seen  since  Thursday,  30  August.  He  disappeared  that  evening  ...  They  say  that  the  body  of  the  suicide  bomber  was  so  man  gled  that  it  cannot  be  identified,  yet  they  produce  a  perfectly  good  ID  card  from  the  dead  man’s  pock  et!  Maybe  it  was  stolen?”   No  mourning  tent  has  been  set  up  outside  Habeishi’s  modest  house.  His  family  insists  that  he  was  not  the  Nahariya  suicide  bomber,  and  observed  a  normal  working  day.  “I’m  convinced  that  he  didn’t  do  it,”  said  Gadvan.  “He  did  not  belong  to  the  Islamic  Movement  and  was  a  respected   man  —  he  had  no  reason  to  com   mit  such  an  act.”   Jerusalem  Post ",2001-09-14
"  Palestinian  legislator  Hanan  Ashrawl   denied  that  Palestinian  celebrations  had  been  In  response  to  the  terror  attacks.   Photo:  Isranet   PA  Chairman  Yasser  Arafat  condemned  the  attack,  offering  Palestinian   assistance  to  find  the  perpetrators.   Photo:  JTA   Jordan’s  King  Abdullah:  “[The   celebrations  are  not]  a  reflection  of...  other  peoples  of  the  Middle  East.”   Photo:  Isranet   NEWS  ANALYSIS   @£B  SesSan   JERUSALEM  —  Never  before  have  so  many  Arab  and  Muslim  leaders  con  demned  a  terrorist  attack  so  swiftly  and  so  strongly.   But  the  official  denunciations  were  drowned  out  by  the  din  of  anti  American  euphoria  in  the  streets  of  several  of  their  countries.   Palestinian  Authority  Chairman  Yasser  Arafat  was  among  the  first  to  denounce  the  terrorist  assaults  last  Tuesday  on  the  Pentagon  and  New  York’s  World  Trade  Centre  —  even  offering  Palestinian  help  in  tracking  down  the  perpetrators.   To  underline  the  point  that  it  was  not  business  as  usual,  Arafat  post  poned  a  long-awaited  visit  to  Syria,  which  remains  on  the  US  list  of  coun  tries  supporting  terrorism.   Arafat’s  comments  came  in  sharp  contrast  to  his  own  people’s  jubila  tion  as  news  of  the  catastrophe  reached  the  Palestinian  streets.   In  the  West  Bank,  thousands  of  Palestinian  men,  women  and  chil  dren  took  to  the  streets  of  Ramallah  and  the  Balata  refugee  camp  in  Nablus.  They  sang,  danced  and  handed  out  sweets  as  if  their  dreams  had  come  true.   In  Nablus,  armed  Palestinians  reportedly  trapped  foreign  photo  journalists  inside  a  hotel  to  prevent  them  from  covering  the  festivities.  At  least  one  photographer  who  man  aged  to  film  the  celebrations  said  he  was  told  his  life  would  be  in  danger  if  the  pictures  were  published.   However,  the  revelry  spread  to  East  Jerusalem,  and  Arab  television  networks  rushed  to  deliver  the  pic   tures  to  the  entire  Arab  world.   Similar  scenes  occurred  in  the  streets  of  Baghdad.  Iraqi  leaders  remained  silent,  but  Iraqi  TV  played  a  patriotic  song  with  the  words  “down  with  America”  as  it  showed  the  World  Trade  Centre  towers  falling.   The  country’s  state-controlled  media  said  the  “American  cowboy”  deserved  the  attacks  for  its  “crimes  against  humanity”.   In  the  face  of  such  scenes,  Arafat  could  only  engage  in  damage  control,  knowing  that  the  free  world  would   show  very  little  understanding  for  Palestinian  support  of  terrorism.   On  Wednesday,  Palestinian  legis  lator  Hanan  Ashrawi  denied  that  the  Palestinian  celebrations  had  been  in  response  to  the  terror  attacks  in  New  York  and  Washington,  describ  ing  such  reports  as  “misleading”.   “We  feel  your  pain,  we  feel  your  sorrow.  We  will  do  everything  we  can  to  help,”  she  was  quoted  as  saying.   Speaking  on  CNN,  King  Abdullah  of  Jordan  called  the  celebrations  iso  lated  events,  saying,  “it’s  no  way  a  reflection  of  the  Palestinian  people  or  other  peoples  of  the  Middle  East”.   “Even  such  long-time   enemies  of  the  United  States   as  Libyan  leader  Muammar   Gadhafi  made  a  point  of  condemning  the  terror  attacks.  [He]  offered   condolences  and   humanitarian  aid  to  the   United  States.""   But  the  joy  on  the  street  reflected  the  depth  of  Arab  and  Muslim  ani  mosity  toward  the  United  States  that  has  been  building  since  the  outbreak  of  the  Palestinian  intifada  a  year  ago.  That  antipathy  reached  a  peak  earli  er  this  month  at  the  World  Confer  ence  Against  Racism  in  South  Africa,  especially  after  the  United  States  and  Israel  walked  out  together.   Israelis  drew  parallels  between  last  Tuesday’s  street  celebrations  and  the  way  Palestinians  “danced  on  the  roofs”  during  the  Gulf  War.   In  1991,  however,  they  were  rejoicing  over  Iraqi  missile  attacks  against  Israel,  while  this  time  they  ridiculed  the  tragedy  of  the  most   powerful  country  in  the  world  —  one  that  has  invested  tremendous  efforts  over  the  past  decade  to  stand  as  an  “honest  broker”  between  Israel  and  the  Palestinians.   When  the  United  States  vowed  on  Tuesday  night,  in  President  Bush’s  words,  to  punish  those  responsible  for  the  attacks  as  well  as  those  who  harbour  them,  trembles  of  fear  could  be  felt  throughout  the  Middle  East  from  Afghanistan  to  Sudan.   Even  such  long-time  enemies  of  the  United  States  as  Libyan  leader  Muammar  Gadhafi  made  a  point  of  condemning  the  terror  attacks.  The  same  man  who  recently  said  US  mili  tary  power  was  increasingly  helpless  in  the  face  of  a  new  kind  of  “rebel  lious  challenge”  this  week  offered  condolences  and  humanitarian  aid  to  the  United  States.   In  Iran,  President  Mohammad  Khatami  said  he  felt  “deep  regret  and  sympathy  with  the  victims”.   In  the  Gaza  Strip,  Sheik  Ahmed  Yassin,  leader  of  the  fundamentalist  Hamas  movement  —  responsible  for  numerous  suicide  attacks  against  Israeli  civilians  —  said  his  organisa  tion  has  no  interest  in  “moving  our  struggle  outside  the  occupied  Pales   tinian  land”.   Perhaps  in  response,  Israel’s  Sephardic  chief  rabbi  urged  “leaders  of  the  Arab  world  who  are  condemn  ing  this  terrible  tragedy”  to  persuade  Muslim  clerics  to  “immediately  can  cel  the  definition  of  a  suicide  bomber  as  a  martyr  and  forbid  all  large-scale  attacks”.   “Whoever  calls  a  suicide  bomber  a  martyr  is  an  accessory  to  the  hor  rible  crime,”  Rabbi  Eliyahu  Bakshi   Doron  said.   His  suggestion  highlighted  the  balancing  act  Arab  leaders  face  as  they  confront  a  free  world  that  is  outraged  over  the  US  tragedy.  Even  a  veteran  political  acrobat  like  Yasser  Arafat  will  find  it  almost  impossible   to  disassociate  himself  from  the  rad  ical  terrorist  elements  behind  this  week’s  attacks  while  at  the  same  time  backing  a  war  of  terror  against   Israel.

"  Letters   Calling  moderate  Muslims  and  Jews   I  WOULD  like  to  add  my  voice  to  Ron   Weiser’s  and  David  Bitel’s  discus  sion  concerning  Jewish-Muslim  rela  tions  (AJN  26/10/01,  2/11/01).   I  do  so  with  my  friend  and  col  league,  Arif  Ongu,  who,  like  me,  is  an  MA  candidate  in  Peace  and  Conflict  Studies.   Mr  Weiser  raises  the  uncon  scionable  statements  made  recently  by  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly,  and  remarks  on  the  absence  of  dissent  from  within  the  Muslim  community  regarding  either  his  words  or  his  sta  tus  as  spiritual  leader.   Sheikh  Hilaly  is  honorary  Mufti  of  the  Australian  Muslim  community,  but  it  is  widely  recognised  that  this  is  a  nominal  position  which  in  no  way  reflects  the  multi-ethnic  nature  of  the  community.   In  reality,  the  majority  of  Muslims  do  not  recognise  him  as  their  spiri  tual  leader  and  pay  little  attention  to   his  statements.   Sheikh  Hilaly  is  the  head  of  one  of  three  mosques  within  the  Lebanese  community.  This  means  two-thirds  of  the  Lebanese  community,  not  to  mention  Muslim  Turks,  Pakistanis,  Bosnian,  Indians,  Somalis,  do  not   recognise  his  leadership.   In  recognition  of  this  problem  of  representation  and  the  negative  reflection  it  brings  to  bear  on  the  entire  Muslim  community,  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic   Councils  is  establishing  a  new  repre  sentative  system.   In  the  meantime,  there  is  a  need,  as  Mr  Weiser  recognises,  to  “pro  mote  greater  harmony  within  Australian  society”.  I  commend  him  on  this  call  and  Mr  Bitel  on  his  recog  nition  that  this  gesture  of  under  standing  might  come  from  either  side  of  the  fence.   Arif  and  I  were  recently  involved  in  a  project  aimed  at  challenging  the  negative  stereotyping  of  Muslims  in  Australia  in  the  wake  of  the  refugee  crisis  and  the  September  11  attack.  I  participated  secure  in  the  convic  tion  that  misunderstanding,  mis  trust  and  discrimination  —  against  any  minority  —  are  a  scourge  on  all  who  live  in  the  society  that  allows  it  to  manifest  unchallenged.   In  times  such  as  these,  when  we  are  encouraged  by  world  events  to  close  ranks  and  move  to  the  safety  of  “us”  and  “them”,  it  is  incumbent   upon  us  to  engage  in  a  continued  ethic  of  dialogue  and  open-minded  ness.  This  cannot  be  dismissed  as  naivety,  but  must  be  understood  as  extending  our  humanity,  and  uniting   others  to  do  the  same.   I  invite  Mr  Weiser  to  offer  his  par  ticipation  in  an  understanding-build  ing  initiative  with  members  of  the  Muslim  community,  where,  through  dialogue  and  hospitality,  we  can  look  towards  the  “peaceful  and  har  monious  views”  that  he  identifies  as  the  desire  of  all  “moderate”  people.   I  invite  Mr  Bitel,  and  all  members  of  the  Jewish  community,  young  and  old,  to  also  express  their  interest  in  doing  so  by  emailing  Arif  and  me  at  melanieschwartz@hotmail.com.   This  is  not  a  time  for  divisiveness  and  name-calling;  it  is  a  time  for  gen  erosity  and  creativity.  Let  us  not  be  satisfied  with  further  delineation   between  “us”  and  “them”.  I  urge  members  of  the  community  to  embrace  the  possibility  of  taking  steps  towards  greater  understand  ing  and  tolerance.   Melanie  Schwartz  Sydney,  NSW ",2001-11-16
"  International   Israel  may  be  targeted  again  as  UN  discusses  terrorism   Michael  Jordan   NEW  YORK  —  As  a  growing  chorus  of  Arab  and  Muslim  leaders  here  and  around  with  world  blame  the  September  11  assault  on  US  support  for  Israel,  pro-Israel  activists  have  returned  to  what  has  historically   been  an  anti-Israel  arena  —  the  United  Nations.   The  world  body  was  scheduled  to  reconvene  for  debate  in  the  General  Assembly  on  September  24,  but  can  celled  that  session  following  the  ter  rorist  hijackings.   While  the  start  has  been  pushed  back  to  November,  the  attacks  and  anticipation  of  US-led  retaliation  spurred  the  UN  to  move  its  annual  debate  on  terrorism  to  this  week.   Israel,  which  after  September  11  expected  a  groundswell  of  sympathy  for  its  own  campaign  against  terror  ists,  may  find  itself  under  rhetorical  assault.  However,  the  criticism  may  be  less  virulent  because  animus  against  the  Arab  world  has  increased  since  the  US  attacks.   The  Arab  world  is  trying  to  deflect  attention  from  the  Middle  Eastern  background  of  the  hijackers  and  their  alleged  accomplices.   The  UN  session  will  probably  fea  ture  debate  on  “What  is  terrorism?”  And  a  bloc  of  six  Gulf  Arab  states  —  most  prominently,  Saudi  Arabia  —  have  said  they  will  support  the  coali  tion  only  if  action  is  also  taken  against  Israel  and  its  “terrorism”  against  the  Palestinians.   “If  they  say  Israel  conducts  terror  ism,  it  wouldn’t  be  smart  because  it  would  backlash  against  them,”  an  Israeli  diplomatic  source  said.  “We  would  blame  every  one  of  them  of  supporting  terrorism.  We  would  not  leave  any  stone  unturned.”   Israel,  said  the  diplomat,  will  trot  out  something  along  the  lines  of  the  definition  of  the  Mitchell  Commission  —  a  US-led  mission  that  this  year  analysed  the  causes  of  ongoing  Israeli-Palestinian  violence.   “Terrorism  involves  the  deliberate   killing  and  injuring  of  randomly  selected  non-combatants  for  politi  cal  ends,”  the  report  says.  “It  seeks  to  promote  a  political  outcome  by  spreading  terror  and  demoralisation  throughout  a  population.”   The  Arab  world  is  expected  to  dis  tinguish  between  “good  terrorism”  and  “bad  terrorism”;  its  traditional   New  Yorkers  converge  on  a  Red  Cross  centre  In  Manhattan  which  Is  seeking   volunteers  and  blood  donations  in  the  wake  of  the  terrorist  attack.   Photo  JTA   argument  is  that  anti-Israel  attacks  are  a  function  of  the  Palestinian  lib  eration  movement.   At  least  for  now,  the  United  States  appears  to  be  backing  off  its  vow  to  wipe  out  terrorism  around  the  globe.   US  President  George  Bush  said  the  coalition  would  snuff  out  only  those  terrorist  networks  with  “global  reach”.  Some  analysts  suspect  that   was  veiled  assurance  to  the  Arab  world  to  convince  more  states  in  the  region  to  join  his  coalition,  that  the  purveyors  of  terror  in  Israel  had  nothing  to  fear  from  Washington.   For  Israel,  adding  insult  to  injury  is  that  Syria  is  virtually  assured  of  being  elected  to  a  two-year  term  on   the  UN  Security  Council.  The  State  Department  lists  Syria  as  a  sponsor  of  terrorism,  and  Israel  accuses  Damascus  of  supporting  Hezbollah.   Yet  Syria  is  the  selected  candidate  of  the  Asia  Group  —  which  is  Israel’s  natural  geographic  home  and  denies  membership  to  the  Jewish  state.   Syria  needs  a  majority  of  votes  within  the  189-member  UN  General  Assembly,  which  is  dominated  by  Arab  and  Muslim  member-states.   Elections  are  traditionally  held  in  mid-October,  with  the  two-year  term  commencing  on  January  1.   Led  by  permanent  members  China,  Russia,  France,  Britain  and  the  United  States,  each  Security   Council  member  is  entrusted  to  maintain  international  peace  and  security;  recommend  methods  for  resolving  international  disputes,  such  as  economic  sanctions  or  mili  tary  action;  and  authorise  the  use  of  military  actions  against  aggressors.   Having  Syria  render  such  judg  ment  “is  like  appointing  A1  Capone  to  be  chief  of  police”,  said  an  Israeli  diplomat.   The  imminent  election  of  Syria,  at  least  in  the  eyes  of  Washington  and  Jerusalem,  will  extend  the  world  body’s  slide  into  disrepute.   First  came  the  US  being  ousted  in  May  from  the  UN  Commission  on  Human  Rights;  Sudan,  which  permits  one  of  the  world’s  last  remaining  slave  trades  to  thrive  within  its  bor  ders,  joined  a  commission  already  populated  by  notorious  human  rights  abusers  like  Syria,  Cuba  and  China.  Then  came  the  UN  World  Conference  Against  Racism,  recently  hosted  by  Durban,  South  Africa.   The  Palestinians  and  their  allies  successfully  rammed  through  a  dec  laration  approved  by  non-govern  mental  organisations  that  indicted  Israel  for  “ethnic  cleansing”,  “geno  cide”,  “racism”  and  “apartheid”.   The  document  called  for  the  iso  lation  of  Israel,  identical  to  the  sanc  tions  slapped  on  South  Africa  during  its  apartheid  era.  The  US  and  Israel  walked  out,  and  mounting  disgust  among  other  Westerners  at  the  con  ference’s  hijacking  prevented  an  equally  harsh  denunciation  of  Israel  in  the  governmental  declaration.   American  Jewish  activists  predict  ed  an  all-out  diplomatic  offensive  by  pro-Palestinian  forces  to  implement  a  “South  Africa”  strategy  against  Israel.  But  September  11  appears  to  have  knocked  the  wind  from  those  sails.  Jewish  activists  and  Israeli  diplomats  say  they  detect  more   muted  behaviour.   It  would  be  less  than  convincing,  they  say,  for  anyone  to  paint  Israel  as  the  world’s  greatest  evil  when  so  much  of  the  world  now  believes  that  mantle  belongs  to  the  perpetrators  of  the  World  Trade  Centre  atrocity.   It  would  be  easy  to  dismiss  the  world  body  as  biased  against  Israel.  But  much  of  the  globe  does  look  to  the  UN  as  a  moral  authority.  And  UN  Secretary-General  Kofi  Annan  said  the  UN  would  assume  a  major  role  in  the  anti-terrorist  coalition’s  interna   tional  fight  against  terrorism.   JTA ",2001-10-05
"  Opinion   Drawing  a  distinction   BY  definition,  all  religious  fundamentalism  is  dangerous.  In  the   Islamic  world,  particularly  the  Arab  Islamic  world,  the  volatile  mix  of  Muslim  fundamentalism,  extremist  politics  and  cultural  isolation  has  created  a  fertile  ground  for  terrorism.   The  terrifying  possibilities  which  could  be  unleashed  on  a  world  which  has  failed  to  curb  radical  elements  and  given  sanctuary  to  criminals  were  realised  in  all  their  unmitigated  horror  in  last  week’s  devastating  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Centre  and  the  Pentagon.   The  Western  world  has  been  rudely  awoken  to  the  threats  posed  by  extremist  regimes  which  harbour  terrorists  —  most  notably  Afghanistan  and  its  notorious  guest,  Osama  bin  Laden.  On  the  many  occasions  when  Israel  has  been  the  target  of  indiscriminate  terror,  the  rest  of  the  world  has  largely  stood  by,  or  ascribed  the  deed  to  the  vagaries  of  the  conflict.  Now  that  America  has  fallen  victim  on  such  a  grotesque  scale,  however,  the  world  is  realising  the  nature  of  the  enemy.   Which  is  not  to  suggest  that  the  conflict  can  be  simplistically  explained  away  in  terms  of  good  and  bad.  While  terrorism  can  never  be  justified,  the  hatred  whose  evil  expression  the  world  wit  nessed  last  week  appears  to  be  directly  related  to  what  Islam  per  ceives  as  Western  imperialism,  as  evidenced  by  the  current  sta  tioning  of  70,000  American  troops  in  Saudi  Arabia  —  an  affront  to  the  holy  Moslem  centres  of  Mecca  and  Medina.   Amid  the  fear  and  grief  that  followed  last  week’s  tragedy,  many  organisations  around  the  world  have  stepped  up  security.  Jewish  institutions  in  Australia  have  responded  similarly.   But  Jews,  whose  experience  of  stereotyping  and  vilification  should  make  us  sensitive  to  all  forms  of  generalisation,  have  rea  son  to  draw  a  distinction  between  the  terrorist  and  the  innocent  who  shares  his  religion.   Australian  Muslims  too  have  had  reason  to  be  concerned,  as  have  Arab  Christians.  Many  have  been  subjected  to  verbal  and  physical  abuse  at  a  level  higher  than  at  any  time  since  the  1991  Gulf  War.  Women  have  had  hijabs  (head  coverings)  pulled  off,  Muslim  schoolchildren  have  been  abused,  a  Lebanese  church  in  the  western  suburbs  was  daubed  with  swastikas,  and  Brisbane  mosques  have  been  firebombed.   Despite  the  silence  from  Australian  Muslim  leaders  in  response  to  the  many  attacks  on  the  Jewish  community  in  the  past  year,  as  a  fellow  minority  community  in  what  should  be  a  caring  multicul  tural  society,  we  are  obliged  to  draw  the  distinction  between  extremists  and  law-abiding  Australian  Muslims  who  have  every  right  to  practise  their  religion  in  freedom.   The  vast  majority  of  Australian  Muslims  are  indeed  law-abiding  citizens,  and  we  should  stand  with  them  and  publicly  object  to  the  group  vilification  in  which  so  many  people  have  indulged.

"  Jewish-EWuslint  comedy   TORONTO  comic  Noam  Rosen,  who  arranged  an  evening  of  Jewish  and  Muslim  comedy  at  a  Toronto  nightclub,  says  the  show  was  so  unusual  that  he  has  received  offers  to  take  it  to  New  York  City.   Billed  as  the  “Mid-East  Optimist  Jewish  Muslim  Comedy  Night”,  the  show  featured  a  roster  of  Jewish  and  Muslim  comics  who  poked  fun  at  sacrosanct  politi  cal  issues  and  religious  stereotypes.   Although  few  of  the  comics  directly  addressed  the  ter  ror  attack  of  September  11,  Osama  bin  Laden  and  other  extremists  were  the  targets  of  more  than  a  few  punch  lines.  “It  was  a  full  house,  and  people  loved  it,”  said  Rosen.  “It  was  a  good  crowd  —  lots  of  Muslims,  Christians,  Jews,  even  an  Israeli  or  two.  And  people  got   most  of  the  humour.  It  was  brilliant.” ",2001-12-07
"  f-3   Fesach—advertising  supplement   East  meets  West  in  Morocco   Linda  ftloral   NEW  YORK—  “When  most  Americans  think  of  Morocco,  they  envision  Casablanca,”  says  Dani  Moyal,  discussing  the  mix  of  Muslim  and  French  cultures  among  Jews  in  her  homeland.   Although  she  was  bom  in  Fez,  her  husband  hails  from  Casablanca,  the  city  immortalised  in  the  classic  film  of  the  same  name  starring  Humphrey  Bogart  and  Ingrid  Bergman.   Jews  inhabited  Morocco  for  seven  centuries  lv""  before  Arab  settlers  arrived.  Many  came  from   the  Iberian  Peninsula  following  the  Expulsion  from  Spain  in  1492.  For  the  most  part,  Muslims  peacefully  coexisted  with  Jews  for  1000  years  in   this  North  African  nation  on  the  Mediterranean  which  grants  Jews  full  rights  as  citizens.   “Influenced  by  Muslim  culture,  our  traditions  are  strong,”  says  Moyal,  describing  the  Asian  jewellery  and  caftans  that  Jewish  and  Muslim  women  wear.  At  weddings,  brides  run  henna  through  their  hair  and  don  ornate  handcrafted  gowns  embroidered  with  gold  thread.   At  sundown  after  the  eighth  day  of  Passover,  it  is  Muslims  who  bring  the  holiday  to  a  close,  starting  a  festivity  called  Mimouna.  Muslim   friends  return  flour  to  Jewish  homes  by  arriving  with  cakes,  cookies,  pastries,  breads  and  crepes.  Carrying  wheat  from  the  field,  they  drape  branches  around  picture  frames  and  mirrors  and   on  chandeliers  and  tables.   Because  most  Mimouna  recipes  use  flour,  they  are  unsuitable  for  Passover.  But  one  &amp;lt;?f  the  most  cherished,  zabane,  is  made  with  whipped  egg  whites  and  sugar,  beaten  until  the  gooey  con  sistency  of  caramel  is  achieved.   Perusing  recipes  in  the  cookbook  La  Cuisine  Juive  Morocaine,  written  by  Vivane  and  Nina  Moryoussef,  Moyal  waxes  poetic  about  the  fresh  vegetables  and  cilantro  that  flavour  the  dry  fava  bean  soup,  served  on  the  first  and  second  nights  of  Passover.  Although  Ashkenazi  Jews  forgo  starchy  beans  and  grains  during  Passover,  Sephardi  custom  permits  people  to  partake  of   beans  and  rice  during  the  holiday.   She’s  enthusiastic  about  lamb  with  white  truf  fles,  the  signature  dish  of  Moroccan  Jewish  cui  sine.  “Moroccans  would  kill  for  this  delicacy,”  says  Moyal  describing  an  aromatic  stew,  served  not  only  at  Pesach,  but  also  at  weddings,  bar  mitzvahs  and  on  Shabbat.  White  truffles  are  diffi  cult  to  find,  so  white  potatoes  can  be  used.   In  February,  when  white  truffles  mature,  they  erupt  from  the  ground  like  popcorn.   Much  of  Morocco’s  Jewish  population  con   sists  of  couples  whose  children  have  emigrated  to  other  countries.  In  1948,  there  were  250,000  Jews  in  Morocco;  today  the  population  has  dwin  dled  to  about  5000.  “Morocco  is  something  that’s  a  part  of  me;  it’s  very  rich,”  says  Moyal,  who  is  travelling  home  with  her  husband  and  three  chil  dren  for  Passover.  At  the  seder,  as  she  recites  “Next  year,  in  Jerusalem,”  she  will  be  overjoyed  to  be  with  her  family  in  Fez.

"  Ability,  not  ethnicity,  the  key  for  political  candidates   CSiantaB  ASsigM   FEDERAL  Labor  MP  Michael  Danby  has  fired  back  at  Islamic  leader  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hilaly  over  the  latter’s  criticism  of  the  Labor  Party  for  not  installing  a  Muslim  candidate  for  next  month’s  by-election  in  the  New  South  Wales  seat  of  Auburn.   Mr  Danby  said  he  is  “absolutely  opposed  to  favouring  candidates  on  the  basis  of  ethnic  weighting”,  supporting  instead  the  candidates  who  are  “most  able”  to  gain  election  to  Federal  Parliament.   “A  candidate’s  ethnicity  and  religion  do  not  have  a  large  bearing  on  whether  they  can  do  the  job,”  he  said.   Currently  the  sole  Jewish  representative  in   MP  for  Melbourne  Ports  Michael  Danby   Liberal  candidate  for   Wentworth  Peter  King   Federal  Parliament,  Mr  Danby  said  his  Jewish  identity  was  only  “partially  important”  when  it  came  to  representing  his  electorate  of  Melbourne  Ports.   Although  30  per  cent  of  his  voters  are  Jewish,  “I  am  concerned  about  matters  which  affect  us  all  —  the  Australian  community.  Issues  may  be  as  broad  as  the  extradition  of  Nazi  suspect  Konrad  Kalejs  or  the  government’s  proposal  to  close  the  only  pensioner  office  in  my  electorate.   “Obviously,  one  must  have  the  capacity  to  grasp  issues  and  implement  policy.  If  you  can’t  do  that,  there’s  no  point  being  there.”   The  Imam  of  Lakemba  Mosque,  Sheikh  Hilaly  recently  attacked  the  State  Government  for  nominating  Legal  Aid  lawyer  Barbara  Perry  as  its  candidate  for  the  by-election  in  Auburn.   Ms  Perry  defeated  a  Muslim  rival,  local  lawyer  Talal  Yassine,  53-26  in  the  preselection   contest.   Sheikh  Hilaly  argued  that  Mr  Yassine  would  have  been  a  preferable  candidate,  given  the  electorate’s  significant  Muslim  population.   The  election  will  be  held  on  September  8.   Premier  Bob  Carr  has  also  supported  the  party’s  decision,  declaring  that  its  candidate  had  been  chosen  fairly  under  ALP  rules.   “To  suggest  that  somehow  she  should  have  been  marked  down  because  of  religious  or  ethnic  origin  consideration,  I  don’t  think  that  would  be  acceptable  to  the  Australian  people,”  he  said,  adding  that  he  was  confident  that  Ms  Perry  would  be  able  to  represent  the  interests  of  the  electorate.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman  agreed.  “It’s  just  as  discriminatory  to  choose  people  on  the  basis  on  their  ethnicity  as  it  is  to  not  choose  them  on  the  same  grounds.  Just  as  I  would  not  like  a  Jew  or  Muslim  to  be  disadvantaged  because  of  their  ethnicity,  I  would  hate  them  to  be  fav  oured  simply  on  the  base  of  their  ethnicity.”   He  also  contended  it  was  unnecessary  for  a  candidate  to  be  of  the  same  ethnic  or  religious  background  as  members  of  the  electorate.   Liberal  Party  candidate  for  the  federal  seat  of  Wentworth  Peter  King,  said  he  had  demonstrated  “a  capacity  to  represent  the   cross-section  of  communities  in  our  local  area”  since  being  nominated.   “Many  members  of  the  Jewish  community  are  involved  in  local  Liberal  Party  branches.  They  and  the  others  in  the  community  with  whom  I  consult  assist  me  in  ensuring  that  I  can  represent  the  community  effectively.”   He  cited  a  number  of  Jewish-related  issues  as  being  on  his  agenda,  including  lobbying  for  government  funding  for  Jewish  schools  and  seeking  to  ensure  accurate  reporting  on  Israel.   “It’s  important  that  parties  select  candid  ates  with  the  experience  to  represent  all  the  residents  in  their  electorate,”  he  said.

"  Shakespeare  with  shari  *a   Fundamentalists   Muslims  mix  western  skills  with  Islamic  rhetoric  to  form  a  dangerous  hybrid   writes  Daniel  Pipes.   A  FUNDAMENTALIST  Muslim   once  said  to  me,  “I  listen  to  Mozart,  I  read  Shakespeare,  I  watch  the  Comedy  Channel  —  and  I  also  believe  in  implementation  of  the  Shari’a  [Islamic  law].”   This  unlikely  combination  may  sound  eccentric,  but  it  is  not.  The  founder  of  Islamic  Jihad,  an  arch-mur  derous  fundamentalist  (or,  more  prop  erly,  Islamist)  organisation,  boasted  of  reading  and  enjoying  Shakespeare.  Ayatollah  Ali  Khamenei,  the  most  pow  erful  figure  in  Iran’s  Islamist  govern  ment,  has  a  well-known  fondness  for  the  Bard  of  Stratford.   More  broadly,  Islamic  radicals  tend  to  be  well  acquainted  with  the  West  (the  main  exceptions  are  those  in  Saudi  Arabia  and  Afghanistan),  hav  ing  learned  its  languages,  studied  its  cultures,  or  lived  there.  A  dispropor  tionate  number  of  them  (such  as  the  heads  of  the  Turkish  and  Jordanian  Islamist  organizations)  are  engineers.  In  a  statement  from  his  Manhattan  jail  cell,  the  mastermind  of  the  World  Trade  Centre  bombing  pointedly  cited  Newton’s  laws  of  physics.   This  points  to  an  important,  if  little  known  fact:  however  much  Islamists  hate  the  West,  they  are  deeply  con  nected  to  it.  They  are  not  peasants  living  in  the  remote  countryside,  but  urbanised,  thoroughly  modem  indi  viduals,  often  university  graduates.  As  westernized  individuals  coping  with  modem  life,  they  seek  the  West’s  learning  and  admire  its  efficiency.   Contrarily,  Islamists  hardly  know   their  own  culture  and  often  disre   spect  it.  Aziz  Al-Azmeh,  a  specialist  on  Islam,  notes  that  they  are  “entire  ly  inattentive  to  the  historical  experi  ence  of  Muslims  and  to  the  historical  character  of  their  law”.  Plans  to  recreate  the  prophet’s  society  notwithstanding,  they  care  little  and  know  less  about  traditional  Islam  —  the  immensely  rewarding  faith  of  nearly  a  billion  adherents.  The  vast  corpus  of  koranic  scholarship  leaves   them  cold,  as  do  lyric  Persian  poets  and  beautiful  Egyptian  mosques.  For  them,  no  less  than  for  a  Swedish  aid  bureaucrat  or  a  World  Bank  develop   ment  economist,  the  Muslim  world  is   a  backward  place  which  urgently  needs  overhauling  through  the  adop  tion  of  western  ways.   That  Islamists  seek  not  a  tradition  al  Islamic  order  but  an  Islamic-fla  vored  version  of  western  life  that  can  best  be  seen  in  their  views  on  reli  gion,  politics  and  the  law.  Their  ideas  about  women  are  perhaps  the  most  striking;  despite  their  insistence  on  veiling  and  on  punishments  for  extra  marital  sex,  Islamists  actually  espouse  an  approach  more  akin  to  western-style  feminism  than  to  any  thing  Islamic.   Traditional  Muslim  men  took  pride  in  their  women  staying  home—  in  well-to-do  households,  females  almost  never  went  outside.  In  con  trast,  Islamists  proudly  speak  of  “lib  erating  women”.  A  veil  once  served  only  to  preserve  a  woman’s  virtue;  today  it  also  facilitates  the  feminist  goal  of  pursuing  a  career.   Opponents  of  Islamism,  Muslim  and  non-Muslim  alike,  too  often  dis  miss  it  as  a  regressive  effort  to  avoid  modern  life,  comforting  themselves  with  the  prediction  that  it  will  be  left  behind  as  modernisation  takes  place.  This  expectation  is  mistaken,  because  Islamism  appeals  most  compellingly  to  Muslims  coping  with  the  challenges  of  modernity,  its  totalitarian  utopianism  yet  has  huge  potential  to  do  damage.   Islamism  will  remain  a  force  for  some  time  to  come.  Its  adversaries  cannot  simply  sit  back  and  await  its  collapse,  but  must  actively  combat  what  has  become  a  nearly  world   wide  scourge.

"  Letters   Islamic  world  not  unified  against  Israel   THE  present  debate  on  refugees  must  not  be  confused  with  the  domestic  law  and  order  problem,  and  the  war  against  terrorism.   We  must  at  all  costs  avoid  the  trite   and  simplistic  temptation  to  see  these  problems  as  arising  from  prob  lems  with  Islam.   It  must  be  stressed  that  contrary  to  public  perceptions,  the  Islamic   world  is  not  unified  and  monolithi  cally  hostile  to  Jews  and  Israel.   There  are  divisions  within  the  Muslim  world  which  transcend  their  religion.  To  take  just  a  few  examples:   •  The  Sunni  Iraqi  Administration  is  in  conflict  with  its  own  Shi’ite  and  Kurdish  populations,  as  well  as  tra  ditionally  with  Shi’ite  Iran.   •  The  Sunni  Talaban  of   Afghanistan  are  persecuting  atro  ciously  the  minority  Shi’ite  Hazara  population,  who  form  the  majority  of  the  Afghan  asylum-seekers  cur  rently  arriving  in  Australia’s  waters.   8  Within  the  Sunni  majority  in  Pakistan,  the  Shi’ite  minority  face  persecution,  as  do  the  Muslim  Ahmaddiyya  community  —  a  fact  recognised  by  recent  Australian  gov  ernments,  with  the  inclusion  of  a  special  assistance  category  humani   tarian  visa  for  Ahmaddis  from   Pakistan  within  the  offshore  refugee  and  humanitarian  program.   8  Sunni  Bangladeshis  still  distrust  Sunni  Pakistanis  because  of  the  hor  rific  problems  they  experienced  in  the  period  leading  to  the  creation  of  the  Bangladesh  in  1971.   8  Israel  maintains  positive  links  with  some  Muslim  administrations,  notably  of  course,  Turkey,  a  close   ally,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  with  Shi’ite  Azerbaijan,  which  has  its  own  conflicts  with  Shi’ite  Iran.   Israel  needs  to  do  a  lot  more  to  win  friends  within  the  Muslim  world.   The  challenge  for  Australian  Jewry  is  to  extend  the  hand  of  friendship  to  Australians  within  the  diverse  Muslim  community  to  foster  a  mutually  respecting  relationship  based  on  knowledge  and  emphasis  ing  the  bonds  which  unite,  rather  than  the  differences  which  divide.   Ignorance,  of  course,  rides  hand  in-hand  with  fear  and  intolerance.  It  is  my  view  that  a  large  majority  with  in  the  diverse  communities  here  professing  one  or  other  of  the   Muslim  beliefs  would  be  more  than  happy  to  participate  in  this  process.   It  is  in  the  mutual  interests  of  both  communities,  as  well  as  the  broader  Australian  community,  for  all  Jews  to  strive  for  this  continuously,  and  not  to  take  the  easy  path  of  mouthing  unthinkingly  populist  xenophobic  anti-Muslim  rhetoric.   In  the  broader  context,  working  and  personal  friendships  developed   in  Australia  between  the  various  communities  will  go  a  long  way  to  overcoming  the  ignorance  which  in  part  is  a  cause  of  the  continuing  strife  in  the  Middle  East.   isaviu  Duel   Chairman,  Social  Justice  and  Overseas,  Jewry  Committee   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies ",2001-10-26
"  Letters   WITH  reference  to  Melanie   Schwartz’s  letter,  “Calling  moderate  Muslims  and  Jews”  (AJN16/11/01):   1.  In  response  to  violence  against  the  Jewish  community  in  Sydney,  during  a  meeting  with  Minister  Philip  Ruddock,  a  delegation  of  Jewish  leaders  inquired  about  the  possibility  of  meeting  with  the  Islamic  Council,  but  were  advised  that  the  Islamic  Council  did  not  wish  to  meet  us.  I  was  present.   2.  The  pushing  of  “Muslim  diversi  ty”  and  “not  all  agree  on  everything”  and  “cultural  diversity”  is  an  obfus  cation.  There  is  a  single  issue  on  which  all  their  official  organisations  agree,  and  that  is  Israel  and  the  Jews.  Look  at  the  behaviour  in  Durban.  And  their  websites  say  it  all.  As  the  Israeli  Consul-General  points  out  —  70  Muslim  nations  speak  with   one  voice  against  Jews  and  Israel  —  that  is  our  PR/hasbara  challenge.   3.  Melbourne’s  Herald  Sun  (19/11/01)  quoted  a  local  Muslim  leader  “praising  suicide  bombing,  the  favoured  means  of  attack  by  Islamic  terrorists  against  Jewish  tar  gets”.  The  paper  commented:   “Defence  of  such  terrorism  would  be   shocking  from  a  religious  leader  at  any  time  ...  The  Australian  media  has  been  too  timid  to  confront  divi  sive  Muslim  leaders  preaching  in  praise  of  terror.”  I  agree.   Why  does  it  require  a  discussion  for  good  Muslims  to  speak  out?  We  will  know  who  to  talk  to  by  who  speaks  out  against  vilification  of,  and  violence  against,  the  Jewish  community.  We  will  know  who  to  talk  to  by  who  speaks  out  against  violence  as  a  way  of  resolving  issues   in  the  Middle  East.   We  will  know  who  to  talk  to  by  who  speaks  out  against  the  bombing  of  children  and  who  urges  a  return  to  the  table.  One  word  of  public  recognition  by  Muslims  here  of  the  above  would  be  all  we  need  to  find  a  partner  to  talk  to.   I  am  sick  of  hearing  Jews  explain  that  Muslims  do  not  mean  what  their  leaders  say;  I  want  to  hear  Muslims  say  that.  I  am  sick  of  Jewish  academics  who,  in  the  name  of  edu  cation  or  academic  freedom,  make  a  pamasa  (income)  at  the  expense  of  the  truth,  the  facts  and  the  interests  of  fellow  Jews.

Malicious  September  11  rumour   SOON  after  the  September  11  terrorist  attack,  malicious  rumours  circulated  on  the  internet  that  4000  Jews  had  not  been  in  the  World  Trade  Centre  that  day  because  they  had  been  warned  by  the  perpetrators  —  Israel’s  Mossad  spy  agency.   A  science  student  from  the  University  of  Sydney  asked  the  panel  about  the  veracity  of  the  claims.  Jeremy  Jones:  “It’s  a  lie,  simple  as  that.

Anyone  can  deny  a  claim.  Me,  as  a  Muslim,  and  the  Muslim  community  can  say  Osama  bin  Laden  didn’t  do  it.  It  comes  down  to  evidence.  If  the  US  doesn’t  have  evidence  or  doesn’t  want  to  share  it  with  the  world,  we’re  in  the  same  position.”   The  student  said  he  had  heard  the  rumours  from  friends.  “I  got  the  impression  that  it  was  credible...  If  the  rumour  that  the  Mossad  organised  [the  World  Trade  Centre  attack]  is  true  and  the  rumour  about  4000  Jews  being  absent  on  the  day  isn’t  true,  then  they  killed  their  own  people.” ",2001-12-14

They  will,  however,  express  their  con  cerns  when  spoken  to  pri  vately.”   “My  daughter  goes  to  a  school  with  a  mixture  of  stu  dents;  she  is  about  the  only  Jew.

"  US  Jewish  militants   charged  with  plotting  to  bomb  Arab  targets   Tom  Tugend   LOS  ANGELES  —  The  national  chairman  of  the  Jewish  Defence  League  and  a  fellow-member  of  the  militant  group  have  been  charged  with  conspiracy  to  blow  up  Arab  and  Muslim  targets  in  California.   Authorities  charged  that  JDL  chairman  Irv  Rubin,  56,  and  Earl  Krugel,  59,  intended  to  blow  up  the  King  Fahd  Mosque  and  the  offices  of  the  Muslim  Public  Affairs   Council,  both  in  Los  Angeles,  and  the  offices  of  Congressman  Darrell  Issa,  an  Arab-American  of  Lebanese  descent.   “Priority  was  to  teach  every   Jew  self-defence  through   free  classes  in  martial  arts   and  weapons  use.”   He  is  a  vocal  critic  of  Israel.   Rubin  and  Krugel  face  charges  of  conspiracy  to  destroy  a  building  with  explosives  and  possessing  a  destructive  device  related  to  a  violent  crime.  The  first  count  carries  30  years  in  prison,  and  the  second  a  maximum  of  five.   Rubin,  a  native  of  Canada  but  a  long-time  California  resident,  was  named  national  chairman  of  the  militant  JDL  in  1985  by  its  founder,  Rabbi  Meir  Kahane.  At  the  time,  Rubin  said  his  priority  was  “to  teach  every  Jew  self-defence”  through  free  classes  in  martial  arts  and  weapons  use.   Jewish  organisations,  including  the  Anti-Defamation  League  and  Simon  Wiesenthal  Centre,  have  condemned  the  alleged  plot.  “We  are  saddened  that  members  of  our  community  would  resort  to  violence  against  Arab  and  Muslim   Americans,”  said  Hadassah  president  Bonnie  Lipton.  “No  grievance  or  political  argument  can  ever  justify  these  tactics.”   Congressman  Gary  Ackerman,  a  critic  of  Arab  terrorism,  also  denounced  the  alleged  plot.  “As  a  member  of  Congress  who  happens  to  be  Jewish,  I  condemn  this  potential  act  of  terrorism.  No  cause  can  justify  murder,  whether  the  cause  is  Palestinian,  Jewish  or  that  of  any  other  group.”   As  outlined  by  US  Attorney  John  Gordon  and  Ronald  Iden  of  the  FBI,  an  informant  attended  a  meeting  with  Rubin  and  Krugel,  during  which  he  was  asked  to  help  bomb  the  targets.  Krugel  said  that  Arabs  “need  a  wake-up  call”.  Rubin  allegedly  said  the  JDL  needed  to  let  people  know  it  was  “alive  in  a  militant  way”.   The  informant  was  told  to  photograph  the  offices  of  the  Muslim  Public  Affairs  Council,  and  to  buy  bomb  components.   Last  weekend,  authorities  say,  Rubin  and  Krugel  told  the  informant  the  target  would  be  the  mosque  and  Issa’s  office.  The  informant  allegedly  delivered  explosive  powder  —  the  last  component  needed  to  construct  pipe  bombs,  to  Krugel’s  house.   Rubin’s  attorney,  Peter  Morris,  said  “Irv  Rubin  never  had  anything  to  do  with  explosives.  It  seems  that  the  government’s  action  is  part  of  an  over-reaction  to  the  September  11”  terror  attack.   Morris’  partner,  Bryan  Altman,  claimed  that  authorities  wanted  to  demonstrate  “even-handedness”  by  balancing  terrorist  charges  against  Muslims  with  charges   against  Jews.

"  Muslims  react  with   bans,  bullets  and  bombs   Haim  Shapiro   JERUSALEM:  The  mufti  of  Jerusalem  responded  to  Monday  night’s  massive  rally  by  laying  claim  to  the  Temple  Mount,  the  Western  Wall  and  its  plaza  —  and  declaring  the  site  of  the  First  and  Second  Temples  off  limits  to  all  non-Muslims.   Ikrema  Sabri,  who  is  affiliated  with  the  Palestinian  Authority,  told  journalists  after  the  rally  that  the  Temple  Mount,  which  Muslims  refer  to  as  Haram  a  Sharif,  is  a  Muslim  Wakf,  or  reli  gious  trust,  a  ruling  which  could  mean  that  it  belonged  irrevocably  to  the  Muslim  religious  authority.  He  also  said  that  Islam  forbade  non-Muslims  praying  there.   “It  is  forbidden  for  Muslims  to  permit  non-Muslims  to  supervise,  conduct  services  or  pray  in  any  part  of  the  mosques  or  under  neath  them,”  the  mufti  said.   He  added  that  not  only  the  land  itself,  but  seven  levels  below  the  surface  and  seven  levels  above  it  are  all  Muslim  property.   Responding  to  Sabri’s  state  ment  on  the  Temple  Mount,  Rabbi  Shmuel  Rabinovich,  the  rabbi  of  the  Western  Wall,  said  that  appar  ently  the  mufti  lacked  an  under   standing  of  the  Temple  Mount  and  its  history.   “It  is  a  pity  that  for  political  motives  he  falsifies  history,”   Rabinovich  said.   The  day  before,  in  New  York,  US  President  Bill  Clinton  told  the  Israel  Policy  Forum  that  Jerusalem  should  be  an  “open  and  undivided  city,  with  assured  freedom  of  access  and  worship  for  all”.  But  he  also  stated  that  Jerusalem  should  be  the  capital  of  both  Israel  and  a  Palestinian  state.   As  Jews  rallied  peacefully  in  support  of  their  capital,  the  southern  Jerusalem  neighbour  hood  of  Gilo  once  again  came  under  Palestinian  fire.  No  one  was  hurt,  but  an  apartment  was  dam  aged.   In  the  French  Hill  neighbour  hood,  Palestinians  tossed  a  fire  bomb  at  Israeli  cars  on  a  major  Jerusalem  thoroughfare.  North  of  the  city,  a  12-year-old  Israeli  boy  needed  surgery  after  being  wounded  in  a  shooting  attack  on  the  Jerusalem-Modi’in  road,  which  passes  near  the  Green  Line  and  has  become  a  focal  point  for   Palestinian  attacks.

"  Lef  s  understand  their  real  motive   VIEWPOINT   L®anne  Peggott   THREE  weeks  after  the  attack,   we  still  have  only  scanty  information  about  the   hijackers  who  crashed  passenger  planes  into  the  Pentagon  and  World  Trade  Centre  on  September   11.   However,  there  has  been  much  speculation  about  their  Arab  Muslim  backgrounds.  Whether  they  were  backed  by  Osama  bin  Laden  or  other  likeminded  operators,  the  intended  message  of  the  carnage  is  intrinsic  in  the  very  nature  and  magnitude  of  the  attack.  What,  then,  was  their  message?   It  is  best  to  start  with  what  the  message  was  not.  Some  commentators  have  said  that   America  had  it  coming.  They  have  identified  US  policy  in  the  Middle  East  and,  in  particular,  its  support  for  Israel  as  the  cause  of  the  hatred  that  motivated  the  hijackers.   Israel  is  considered  by  the  Arab  world  to  be  an  unwelcome  colonial  implant  into  what  is  otherwise  a  homogenous  non-European  region,  much  as  Australia  is  perceived  by  many  of  our  Asia  neighbours.   The  finger  has  also  been  pointed  at  America’s  support  for  UN  sanctions  against  Iraq.  But  since  1995,  the  sanctions  regime  has  permitted  Iraq  to  sell  its  oil  and  use  the  money  to  buy  food,  medicine  and  other  necessities  for  its  people.  Iraqi  President  Saddam  Hussein,  however,  prefers  to  use  the  money  to  acquire  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  So  the  Iraqi  people  continue  to  suffer.   The  “America  had  it  coming”  school  also  blames  US  support  for  the  unpopular  monarchies  of  the   Arab  world.  The  problem  with  that  analysis  is  that  they  are  not  all  unpopular,  and  those  that  are  must  attribute  the  causes  of  their  unpopularity  to  internal  corruption,  nepotism  and  an  absence  of  civil  (if  not  basic  human)  rights,  all  of  which  have  always  been  the  hallmarks  of  Arab  regimes.   Very  clearly,  the  carnage  on  September  11  was  not  a  call  to  the  American  Government  to  reconsider  or  reverse  its  various  policies  in  the  Middle  East.  If  that  had  been  the  intention,  those  policies  would  have  been  highlighted  in  the  chosen  targets  as  meticulously  as  every  other  aspect  of  the  operation.   “For  the  perpetrators,  the   problem  is  not  what  America  does,  but  what  America  is.”   For  the  perpetrators,  the  problem  is  not  what  America  does,  but  what  America  is.  That  is  why  they  chose  as  their  targets  the  symbols  of  US  military  and  economic  power.   America  in  their  mindset  represents  the  international  centre  of  idolatrous  materialism.  Islam  divides  the  world  into  two  realms:  the  dar  al-Islam  (the  territory  of  Islam),  where  Islam  is  dominant;  and  the  dar  al-harb  (the  territory  of  war,  or  enemy  territory),  where  Islam  is  not  dominant  —  yet.   It  is  the  duty  of  every  Muslim  to  wage  jihad  (holy  war)  against  the  dar  al-harb  until  it  ceases  to  exist  and  the  whole  world  is  dar  al  Islam.  However,  Muslims  have  differed  sharply  over  what  jihad   means.   Some  modern  Muslim  writers  claim  that  Shari’a  (Islamic  law)  permits  the  use  of  force  only  in  self-defence.  But  the  majority  of  Islamic  jurists  acknowledge  that  both  the  Koran  (Muslim  holy  book)  and  Sunna  (teachings)  also   sanction  the  use  of  force  in   propagating  Islam.   If  the  majority  view  is  correct,  it  brings  Shari’a  into  direct  conflict  with  the  principles  of  modern   international  law  and  the  UN   Charter.  This  is  so  even  though   controversies  still  exist  within  Islam  about  the  nature  and  magnitude  of  the  force  that  may   be  used.   Even  though  Shari’a  sanctions  the  use  of  force  to  propagate  Islam,  very  few  Muslims  would  agree  that  it  justified  the  appalling  and  indiscriminate  carnage  against  innocent  civilians  on  September  11.  But  there  is  undoubtedly  an   extremist  element  which  does  support  it.  They  believe  that  the  Muslim  fighters  who  caused  Soviet  forces  to  withdraw  from  Afghanistan  were  directly  responsible  for  the  collapse  of  the  Communist  atheistic  Soviet  regime.  They  have  as  yet  little  understanding  of  how  economic  forces  bring  about  the  implosion  of  closed  societies  of  any  kind,  including  Islamic  ones.   In  the  full  flush  of  religious  fervour,  the  extremist  supporters  of  the  September  11  attacks  are   utterly  convinced  that  America  is  now  the  only  remaining  pillar  of  infidel  power  in  the  world,  and  the  only  obstacle  to  bringing  the  whole  planet  within  the  fold  of  dar   al-Islam.   The  message  is  clear.  Whether  America  responds  to  the  September  11  attacks  or  not,  it  will  continue  to  be  the  target  of  extremist  violence  unless  or  until  it  succumbs  to  Islamic  rule.  This  is   surely  not  going  to  be  a  short-term  contest.  It  will  come  to  an  end  only  when  the  Islamic  world  as  a  whole  comes  to  the  conclusion  that  the  use  of  force  —  any  force  —  to  propagate  its  faith  must  either  be  abandoned  altogether  or  consigned  to  a  millennial  future.   The  tragedy  lies  in  the  vast  number  of  innocent  people  who  will  die  and  suffer  in  the   meantime.  Those  who  were  killed  and  maimed  in  the  attacks  three  weeks  ago  were  not  the  captains  of  American  economic  and  military  power;  they  were  ordinary  working  people,  including,  no  doubt,  a  significant  number  of  Muslim  Americans,  doing  nothing  more  sinister  than  earning  a  living  to  support  themselves  and  their  families.   And  when  the  inevitable  response  comes  from  the  US  and  its  allies,  one  can  be  equally  certain  that  a  disproportionate  share  of  the  punishment  will  be  meted  out  to  the  innocent,  rather  than  the  guilty.

"  International   Israelis  worry  about  bin  Laden   Gil  Sedan   JERUSALEM  —  Israel  has  not  been  a  prime  target  on  Saudi  billionaire  Osama  bin  Laden’s  terrorist  agenda,  but  Israeli  officials  worry  that  could  soon  change.   Israeli  terror  experts  such  as  Major-Gen  eral  Amos  Malka,  the  chief  of  army  intelli  gence,  said  recently  that  bin  Laden  is  gearing  up  for  action  against  Israel  by  send  ing  members  of  his  terror  organisation  to  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  Strip,  or  by  recruiting  followers  in  the  Palestinian   territories.   If  Israel  until  now  has  not  figured  promi  nently  on  bin  Laden’s  terror  map,  these  experts  say,  it  is  not  because  he  doesn’t  want  to  hurt  Israel,  but  simply  because  the  Israeli  Palestinian  conflict  is  not  his  first  priority.   But  that  situation  could  soon  change,  according  to  Israeli  security  officials  cited  by  the  Israeli  daily  Ha’aretz.  These  officials  say  bin  Laden  may  become  increasingly  motivat  ed  to  strike  Israel  because  of  growing  criti  cism  from  within  his  fundamentalist  Muslim  organisation  regarding  his  failure  to  support  the  Palestinians  in  their  struggle  against  the   Jewish  State.   Bin  Laden’s  launching  pad  for  holy  war  is  A  Qaida  —  Arabic  for  “the  base”  —  his  own  private,  highly  effective  terror  organisation.   A  Qaida’s  primary  goal  is  “to  unite  all  Muslims  and  establish  a  government  that  fol  lows  the  rule  of  the  caliphs”,  according  to  the  group’s  own  words.   The  group’s  fight,  therefore,  is  not  specifi  cally  against  Israel  but  the  entire  non-Islamic  world.   Like  other  Islamic  fundamentalist  leaders,  bin  Laden  perceives  the  western  powers  as  successors  to  the  Crusaders.   He  perceives  himself  as  the  successor  to  the  great  Muslim  warrior  Saladin,  who  con  quered  Jerusalem  from  the  Crusaders  in  October  1187  and  kicked  the  “infidels”  off  holy  Muslim  soil.   Several  months  ago,  the  Israeli  press  came  out  with  banner  headlines  disclosing  that  bin  Laden  followers  were  trying  to  establish  a  foothold  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  Strip.   In  June  2000,  according  to  recently  released  details,  Israeli  security  agents  arrested  a  Palestinian,  Nabil  Ukal,  27,  a  resi  dent  of  the  Jabalya  refugee  camp  in  Gaza.   “In  June  2000...  Israeli  security   agents  arrested  a  Palestinian  resident  of  the  Jabalya  refugee  camp  in  Gaza...  Al  Qaida’s  first   agent  in  the  territories.""   Ukal,  who  left  Gaza  in  October  1997  to  study  religion  in  Pakistan,  returned  to  the  region  the  next  year  as  Al  Qaida’s  first  agent   in  the  territories.   Upon  his  return  to  Gaza,  Ukal  is  known  to  have  met  with  the  spiritual  leader  of  Hamas,  Sheik  Ahmed  Yassin.  Yassin  gave  Ukal  $US10,000  ($A19,428)  for  his  activities.   When  Israel  brought  charges  against  Ukal  after  his  arrest,  he  was  indicted  for  planning  to  carry  out  a  large-scale  attack  in  the  centre  of  the  country.   Only  a  few  carefully  selected  journalists  have  so  far  been  given  the  opportunity  to   meet  with  bin  Laden  in  his  hideout  some   i   where  in  the  mountains  of  Afghanistan.   A1  Jazeera  Television,  a  network  that  broadcasts  from  Qatar,  recently  was  granted  an  exclusive  interview  with  bin  Laden  that  sheds  light  on  the  most  wanted  terrorist  in  history.   With  his  rifle  nearby,  bin  Laden  enunciat  ed  his  belligerent  worldview.   “There  are  two  sides  to  this  conflict,”  he  said,  with  a  half-smile.  “America,  Israel  and  ‘Crusader’  countries  like  England  that  want  to  rule  the  world,  on  one  hand  —  and  Islam  on  the  other  hand.”   Because,  according  to  his  view,  the  West  wants  to  control  the  rest  of  the  world,  it  is  legitimate  to  hate  westerners  and  fight  them.   “Every  American  who  tries  to  hurt  Islam  is  a  legitimate  target.”   According  to  western  intelligence  offi  cials,  A1  Qaida’s  base  is  located  in  Afghanistan,  where  bin  Laden  settled  five  years  ago  after  he  was  expelled  from  Sudan.   From  there,  its  tentacles  stretch  all  over  the  world.  A1  Qaida  is  thought  to  be  involved  in  a  number  of  international  conflicts,  having  given  support  to  Muslim  fighters  in  Bosnia,  Chechnya,  Tajikistan,  Somalia,  Yemen  and   Kosovo.   Bin  Laden  is  happy  that  at  least  one  Mus  lim  nation  has  a  nuclear  capability.   In  his  interview  with  A1  Jazeera  Televi  sion,  he  spoke  with  pride  that  Pakistan  has  an  “Islamic  bomb”.   “We  don’t  need  to  apologise  for  having  a  nuclear  potential,”  he  said  in  the  interview.  “It  is  our  right.  With  Israel  in  possession  of  hundreds  of  nuclear  warheads,  with  Ameri  can  and  western  nuclear  hegemony  in  the  world,  it  is  definitely  our  right.”   JIA   ,  os&amp;lt;m  em  uiden,   Weridi  Most  Wanted  Terrorist ",2001-09-21
"  Jews  taught  Mm  a  lot,  Indonesian  President  tells  religious  leaders   Jeremy  Jones  &amp;   Victor  Kleerekoper   INDONESIAN  President  Abdurrahman  Wahid  told  a  meeting  of  leaders  of  Australia’s  major  religious  communities  in  Sydney  that  he  has  “learned  very  much  from  Judaism”  and  had  a  deep  interest  in  Kabbala.   A  Muslim  and  the  political  leader  of  the  world’s  most  populous  Muslim  nation,  Wahid  made  his  comments  during  a  meeting  with  representatives  of  the  Jewish,  Christian,  Buddhist,  Hindu  and  Muslim  faiths.   He  said  that  he  had  lived  in  Baghdad  for  some  years  and  had  a  close  friend  who  was  Jewish.  “I  cried  with  my  Jewish  friend  when  he  discussed  the  Holocaust,”  he  said,  “and  I  was  shocked  when  Saddam  Hussein,  out  of  his  madness,  made  Jews  suffer.”   A  leader  in  interfaith  dialogue  prior  to  his  election  in  1999,  Wahid  said  the  essence  of  Islam  is  to  know  and  respect  other  faiths,  and  the  Koran  teaches  that  human  beings  are  made  into  tribes  in  order  to  learn  from  each  other,  not  to  kill  each  other.   Expanding  on  the  theme  of  what  Muslims  can  learn  from  Judaism,  he  told  the  meeting  that  he  had  requested  material  on  the  Kabbala.  He  responded  enthusiastically  when  told  by  a  Jewish  delegate  that  he  would  be   presented  with  books  on  the  subject  at  a  state  dinner  after  the  dialogue,  organised  by  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council.   Wahid  also  said  he  respected  the  ecumenical  developments  within  the  Catholic  Church,  beginning  with  the  Second  Vatican  Council  during  the  1960s,  and  that  Indian  pacifist  Mahatma  Gandhi  was  his  hero.   The  Jewish  delegates  at  the  meeting  were  Great  Synagogue  Senior  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple,  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  national  vice-president  Jeremy  Jones  and  Josie  Lacey,  executive  member  of  the  World  Conference  on  Religion  and  Peace.   Rabbi  Apple  said  he  believed  President  Wahid  was  interested  in  aiding  constructive  dialogue  between  Israel  and  the  Arab  nations.   Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  executive  director  Dr  Colin  Rubenstein  met  privately  with  Wahid  in  Canberra;  they  had  previously  met  in  Indonesia  in  February  2000.  Dr  Rubenstein  applauded  Wahid  for  his  work  on  tolerance  towards  Israel.   Wahid  stressed  that  Indonesia  could  function  as  a  healthy  society  only  when  Islam  was  non-political  and  non-ideological,  but  functioned  as  a  code  of  morality.

"  Where  are  the  voices  of  moderate  Moslems?   I  AM  disturbed  by  David  Bitel’s  let  ter,  “Islamic  world  not  unified  against  Israel”,  which  supposedly  was  about  the  “present  debate  on  refugees”  and  which  was  signed  in  his  capacity  as  a  Board  of  Deputies  committee  chairman  (AJN  26/10/01).   In  fact,  a  large  part  of  the  letter  details  numerous  examples  of  differ   ences  within  the  Muslim  world.   However,  it  should  be  noted  that  these  differences  have  nothing  to  do  with  any  branch  of  Islam  arguing  for  or  against  Israel  at  all,  as  is  the  infer   ence.   Sadly,  there  is  no  greater  unifying  factor  within  the  Islamic  world  than  hate  for  and  opposition  to  Israel.  The  Islamic  states  were  unified  in  their  opposition  to  Israel  in  Durban  and  in  the  United  Nations  and  in  the  Arab  League.  They  were  also  unified  in  Durban  on  a  number  of  anti  Jewish  positions.   And  what  on  earth  is  supposed  to  be  the  meaning  of  the  statement  “Israel  needs  to  do  a  lot  more  to  win  friends  within  the  Muslim  world”?   Such  one-sided  and  ill-informed  statements,  written  supposedly  by  a   senior  member  of  the  NSW  Jewish   Board  of  Deputies  and  over  its  name,  raises  serious  questions  about  our  hasbara  efforts.   The  assertion  that  being  nicer  to  each  other  here  will  “go  a  long  way  to  overcoming  the  ignorance  which  in  part  is  a  cause  of  the  continuing  strife  in  the  Middle  East”  is  naive  at  best  when  it  comes  to  the  Middle  East  itself,  but  yes  it  would  promote  greater  harmony  within  Australian  society,  which  of  course  would  be  a  good  thing.   Perhaps  as  a  starting  point,  Mr  Bitel  should  ensure  that  the  “large  majority  within  the  diverse  commu  nities  here  professing  one  or  other  of  the  Muslim  beliefs”,  as  he  claims,  should  actually  speak  out  loudly  and  publicly  and  condemn  the  views  of  Sheikh  Taj  el-Din  Hilaly,  who  is  the  spiritual  leader  of  Muslims  in  this  country.   We  were  reminded  of  some  of  the  sheikh’s  views  by  Alan  Ramsey  in  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald  last  week  end.  Views  such  as  saying  that  the  Jews  are  “the  underlying  cause  of  all  wars”  or  such  friendship  promoting   views  as  Jews  “use  sex  and  abom  inable  acts  of  buggery  to  control  the   world”.   To  the  best  of  my  knowledge,  we  do  not  hear  representatives  of  this  “large  majority”  of  Muslims  in  Australia  speak  out  against  either  the  words  of  Sheikh  Hilaly  or  the  description  of  him  as  the  spiritual  leader  of  Australia’s  Muslims.   Mr  Bitel  states  that  “his  view”  is  that  they  “would  be  more  than  happy  to  participate  in  this  process”.  If  that  is  really  correct,  then  he  should  encourage  them  to   do  so.   Even  if  they  could  not  express  peaceful  and  harmonious  views  in  places  like  Iraq  and  Iran,  surely  in  this  free  and  democratic  country  they  can  if  they  choose  to.

"  Balkan  religious  leaders  urge  harmony   Ruffe  ECMs@r   ROME  —  Jewish  leaders  have  joined  other  religious  leaders  in  calling  for  peace  and  dialogue  in  two  Balkan   states  —  Macedonia  and  Bosnia.   Religious  leaders  from  Macedonia  issued  a  statement  late  last  week  expressing  their  “commitment  to  the  One  God  for  peace  for  our  common  country”  and  urging  international  support  for  peace  initiatives.   Izhak  Asiel,  the  chief  rabbi  of  Macedonia  and  Yugoslavia,  and  Vik  tor  Mizrachi,  the  president  of  the  200  member  Macedonian  Jewish  community,  signed  the  statement  along  with  leaders  of  the  Catholic,  Muslim,  Methodist  and  Macedonian  Orthodox  faiths.   The  move  came  against  the  back  ground  of  tensions  between  the  Macedonian  government  and  ethnic  Albanian  rebels  that  have  threatened  for  weeks  to  explode  into  full-scale   civil  war.   The  statement  was  released  at  the  dose  of  a  three-day  meeting  of  Mace  donian  religious  leaders  organised  in  Switzerland  by  the  World  Congress   of  Churches.   In  the  statement,  the  leaders  acknowledged  —  but  at  the  same  time  sought  to  distance  themselves  from  —  the  strong  role  that  religious  identity  plays  in  ethnic  conflict   “The  Bosnian  statement,   signed  by  Jewish,  Muslim,   Catholic  and  Orthodox   representatives,  urged  world   leaders  to  ‘help  the  human   and  moral  reconstruction’  of   the  country.”   “Our  churches  and  religious  com  munities  are  not  involved  in  the  con   met,  ana  we  strongly  reject   any  effort  to  allow  our  selves  to  be  involved  and  to  be  manipulated,  as  well  as  any  misuse  of  religious  sym  bols  and  language  for  the  purposes  of  violence,”  it   said.   Calling  for  dialogue,  the  statement  said  peace  “is  too  important  to  leave  only  to  the  efforts  of  politicians.  Peace  is  also  a  responsibili  ty  of  the  churches  and  of  the  religious  communities.   “We  call  on  religious  communities  around  the  world  to  pray  with  us  and  to  support  our  efforts  for  peace.”   The  statement  was  issued  just  days  after  religious  leaders  from  Bosnia,  meeting  in  Rome,  called  upon  people  of  faith  to  help  consoli  date  the  peace  and  reconstruct  that  country,  which  was  wracked  by  eth  nic  warfare  in  the  1990s.   The  Bosnian  statement,  signed  by  Jewish,  Muslim,  Catholic  and  Ortho  dox  representatives,  urged  world  leaders  to  “help  the  human  and  moral  reconstruction”  of  the  country  by  taking  steps  to  rebuild  the  numer  ous  churches,  mosques,  cemeteries  and  other  religious  sites  that  were  damaged  or  destroyed  during  the  bloody  Bosnian  civil  war.   “There  is  nothing  in  the  Balkans  that  does  not  include  both  political  and  religious  components,”  Mizrachi  told  JTA  before  the  Macedonian  statement  was  signed.   “Our  situation  is  very  different  from  that  in  Bosnia,”  he  said.  There,  he  noted,  the  inter-faith  initiatives  were  happening  in  a  “postwar,  post   bloodshed”  situation.   In  Macedonia,  he  said,  inter-faith  activities  are  aimed  at  “preventing  a  situation  such  as  happened  in  Bosnia  from  taking  place”.   “We  feel  that  the  only  way  to  pre  vent  intolerance  or  conflict  is  educa  tion,”  Mizrachi  said.  “If  everything  one  group  does  is  perceived  as  a  mystery  to  another  group,  it  could  also  be  perceived  as  a  threat,  and  politicians  can  manipulate  this.”  JTA ",2001-06-22
"  EU  will  support  Israel   JERUSALEM  —  The  European  Union  will  work  together  with  Israel  at  the  World  Conference  on  Racism  to  ensure  that  Arab  and  Muslim  nations  do  not  succeed  in  passing  an  antisemitic  resolution,  Israeli  Deputy  Foreign  Minister  Michael  Melchior  said  last  week.   Melchior  met  with  Belgian  Foreign  Minister  Louis  Michel,  current  chairman  of  the  EU.   In  the  conference  draft  resolution,  Zionism  is  termed  a  “movement  which  is  based  on  racial  superiority”,  “Zionist  practices  against  Semitism”  are  slammed,  and  the  Holocaust,  which  is  spelled  with  a  lower-case  “h”,  is  compared  to  the  “ethnic  cleansing  of  the  Arab  population  in  historic  Palestine”.  The  draft  also  calls  on  nations  to  refrain  from  recognising  Jerusalem  as  the  capital  of  Israel.   US  Secretary  of  State  Colin  Powell  and  Israel  are  boycotting  the  conference  because  of  the  refusal  of  Arab  and  Muslim  states  to  delete  virulent  anti-Israel   language  from  the  draft  declaration,  and  opposition  to  demands  from  African  states  for  reparations  for  centuries  of  slavery  and  colonialism.   Michel  and  Melchior  discussed  the  parameters  of  language  acceptable  and  not  acceptable  to  Israel  in  the  resolution.  Michel  said  he  and  Melchior  would  co  ordinate  their  efforts  to  reach  a  compromise  at  the  summit,  where  the  two  will  head  their  country’s  delegations.   “He  agreed  that  the  proposal  was  antisemitic,”  Melchior  said.  “He  understands  that  there  can  be  no  singling  out  of  Israel  and  no  hate  language  delegitimising   Israel.”   The  president  of  Hadassah,  Bonnie  Lipton,  has  called  on  the  112  countries  that  have  benefitted  from  the  services  of  Hadassah’s  institutions  in  Israel  to  reject  attempts  to  include  anti-Israel  and  anti-Jewish  rhetoric  at  the   conrerence.

"  World  Heritage  listing  being  sought  for  four  Israeli  sites   Stefan  BSalogusSci   INTERNATIONAL  experts  will  visit  Israel  next  week  in  a  preliminary  step  to  the  inscription  of  Mount  Zion  and  three  other  sites  on  the  World  Her  itage  List.   The  inclusion  of  Mount  Zion  is  expected  to  anger  Arab  and  Muslim  countries,  some  of  which  have  tried  to  pressure  the  World  Heritage  Com  mittee  to  delay  the  missions.   The  Committee’s  Australian  chair  man,  Peter  King,  said  a  “consensus”  had  been  reached  among  the  seven  nations  of  the  World  Heritage  Bureau   (the  Committee’s  executive  arm)  to  send  the  missions,  which  will  assess  the  natural  and  cultural  significance  of  Akko’s  old  city,  Masada  and  the  Negev’s  rift  valley.   “Subject  to  stringent  conditions  and  to  referring  non-technical  issues  to  UNESCO,  the  preliminary  techni  cal  work  will  proceed,”  he  said.   He  said  that  issues  of  sovereignty   and  politics  were  “irrelevant  consid  erations  to  the  important  questions  of  the  cultural  value  of  the  sites.  I  am  interested  in  the  conservation  of  world  heritage  and  will  deal  with  this  application  in  the  normal  way”.   The  technical  missions  by  the  International  Commission  on  Monu  ments  and  Sites  and  the  International  Union  for  the  Conservation  of  Nature  will  report  to  the  World  Heritage  Bureau  in  Paris  in  June.  It  is  there  that  Arab  and  Muslim  states  are  expected  to  exert  pressure  to  stop  the  listing   process.   Arab  states  have  been  anxious  to  avert  even  a  preliminary  step  towards  World  Heritage  listing  for   World  Heritage  Committee  chairman  Peter  King  meets  Israel]  Ambassador  baonei  Levy.   Mount  Zion,  which  lies  outside  the  southern  wall  of  Jerusalem’s  Old  City.   Israel  is  keen  for  Mount  Zion  —  the  site  of  King  David’s  tomb,  as  well  as  areas  of  Christian  significance  —  to  receive  international  recognition  that  it  is  part  of  the  Jewish  State.   Israeli  Ambassador  Gabriel  Levy:  “We  don’t  see  why  it  should  not  be  listed  because  Mount  Zion  was  under  Israeli  sovereignty  and  part  of  Israel’s  territory  since  the  [1949]  Armistice.  It  was  not  taken  after  1967.”   The  list  of  four  sites  was  whittled  down  from  22  that  Israel  presented  to  the  21-member  World  Heritage  Com  mittee  in  Cairns  last  year.   Last  week,  Mr  King  and  Mr  Levy  met  in  Sydney  to  discuss  what  is  Israel’s  first  participation  in  the  World  Heritage  process.   Mr  King:  “I  consulted  Mr  Levy  on   questions  of  safety  and  security  in  Israel  for  the  missions.  I  received  assurances,  and  as  a  result  of  those  assurances  and  consultations  with  the  members  of  the  Bureau,  I  have  decided  that  the  missions  proceed  ...  The  World  Heritage  List  is  a  list  of  the  wonders  of  the  world  ...  I  am  very  pleased  that  Israel  has  become  a  party  that  fully  participates  in  the  world  heritage  movement.”   Lecturer  in  Modem  Middle  East  Studies  at  the  University  of  Sydney  Leanne  Piggott  attributed  Arab  and  Muslim  opposition  to  the  missions  to  their  claims  of  sovereignty  over  Jerusalem.  “Any  unilateral  act  by  Israel  concerning  matters  to  do  with  Jerusalem  will  be  opposed.  For  Arabs  and  Muslims,  this  would  be  seen  as  Israeli  taking  steps  to  legitimise  its  claim  over  the  city,”  she  said. ",2001-03-02

"  Visions  of  peace   after  September  11   A  MULTI-FAITH  panel  on  the  topic  “Visions  of  Peace”  was  organised  by  the  Hillel  Jewish  Student  Services  of  The  Shalom  Institute,  together  with  the  World  Conference  of  Reli  gion  and  Peace  (WCRP).

"  Another  global  forum  set  to  condemn  Israel   Michael  Jordan   NEW  YORK  —  With  a  major   international  forum  set  to  condemn  Israel  this  week,  Israeli  and  Jewish  activists  fear  the  meeting  could  incite  further  bloodshed  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  Strip.   “The  crowds  will  feed  off  this,”  said  an  Israeli  diplomat.  “It  will  feed  the  violence  and  hatred  of  Israel.”   The  bottom  line  is  that  the  Fourth  Geneva  Convention  —  like  the  UN  anti-racism  conference  in  Durban  three  months  ago  —  will  lay  bare  a  stark  fact:  Israel  is  held  to  a  different  standard  to  the  rest  of  the  world.   The  Fourth  Geneva  Convention,  based  on  the  “protection  of  civilian  persons  in  time  of  war”,  was  established  in  response  to  Nazi  atrocities  against  civilians,  primarily  Jews,  during  the  Holocaust.   The  convention,  to  which  every  country  is  a  signatory,  has  been  convened  once  —  on  July  15,  1999,  at  the  behest  of  the  Arab  world,  to  scrutinise  Israeli  treatment  of   Palestinians.  That  meeting,  boycotted  by  Israel  and  the  US,  was  adjourned  after  17  minutes.   It  was  set  to  reconvene  this  week,  again  without  Israeli  or  US  representation.  Again,  the  focus  was  Israeli  behaviour  in  the  territories.   “Reconvening  it  is  so  outrageous,  you  want  to  scream,”  Anti  Defamation  League  national  director  Abraham  Foxman  said.  “It’s  a  hypocrisy,  a  charade.  It’s  like  Durban  II,  a  slap  in  the  face  of  Israel  and  the  Jewish  people.”   In  Durban,  a  fortnight-long  gathering  was  ostensibly  aimed  at  galvanising  the  world  against  prejudice,  but  it  was  hijacked  by  Arab  and  Muslim  activists  bent  on  isolating  Israel  as  the  worst  offender  of  those  universal  ideals.   “It’s  scandalous,”  said  Harris  Schoenberg,  chairman  of  the  UN  caucus  of  Jewish  non-governmental  organisations.  “You  have  prisoners  being  killed  in  Afghanistan”  —  summary  execution  of  prisoners  violates  international  law  —  yet  “they’re  reconvening  the  Fourth   Geneva  Convention  to  demonise  Israel  for  protecting  its  citizens  from  Arabs  blowing  them  up”.   Switzerland,  gatekeeper  of  the  Fourth  Geneva  Convention,  is  responsible  for  organising  the  meeting  —  when  requested.   In  October  2000,  after  the  intifada  broke  out,  both  the  UN  General  Assembly  —dominated  by  Arab  and  Muslim  states  —  and  the  22  member  Arab  League  submitted  a  request  to  organise  the  meeting.   The  draft  declaration  reiterates   that  the  convention’s  legal  obligations  apply  to  the  West  Bank,  Gaza  and  East  Jerusalem  and   contains  a  reference  to  Israel  as  the  “occupying  force”.   That  the  European  Union  is  lending  credibility  to  the  meeting  disturbs  observers.  The  convention  was  created  because  of  what  was  done  to  the  Jewish  people;  now  it  is  being  used  against  them.   “I  can  understand  their  feelings,  the  bitter  irony,”  a  European  diplomat  said  .about  Jewish  sentiments.  “But  Arabs  would  raise  the  concern  ‘Why  is  the  situation  in  Middle  East  not  of  concern  to  the  UN  Security  Council?’  It’s  always  a  question  of  your  perspective.”   Pro-Israel  advocates  have  some   answers.  In  world  bodies  like  the  UN,  where  each  country  has  an  equal  vote,  the  numbers  of  the  large  Arab  and  Muslim  bloc  prevails.   There  is  the  economic  pressure  which  the  Arab  world  exerts.   And  then  there  are  the  ramifications  of  having  such  resolutions  on  the  books.  “Textbooks  will  say  that  Israel  was  guilty  of  crimes  against  humanity,  which  legitimised  its  isolation,”  said  US  Jewish  leader  Malcolm  Hoenlein.  “The  Arab  world  will  justify  this  by  pointing  to  documents  such  as  the  one  at  Geneva  and  saying  ‘it  was  the   international  community.

"  A  death  with  a  dire  warning   VIEWPOINT   Avi  Davis   THE  name  Rehavam  Ze’evi  has  never  meant  much  to  most  Ameri-  cans.  But  it  should  now.  The  assas-  sination  of  the  Israeli  Minister  of  Tourism  in  his  hotel  room  in  Jerusalem  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  course  of  events  in  the  Middle  East  and  almost  cer-  tainly  on  the  US-led  war  against  ter-   rorism.       That  Ze’evi  was  targetted  as  a  symbol  of  the  Israeli  right’s  rejec-  tion  of  a  future  Palestinian  state  cannot  be  doubted.  A  consistent  opponent  of  the  Oslo  Accords,  for  years  he  has  warned  of  the  likely  development  of  a  terrorist  state  on  Israel’s  doorstep  and  the  need  to  expel  Arafat  before  this  happened       Yet  there  are  many  analysts  already  arguing  that  Ze’evi’s  assas-  sination  is  a  sign,  not  that  Arafat  may  still  be  using  terror  to  achieve  diplomatic  goals,  but  that  he  may  not  be  in  control  at  all.  They  demand  that  everything  now  be  done  by  the  US  to  shore  up  Arafat’s  capacity  to  crack  down  on   hard-liners.       That  is  certainly  not  the  posi-  tion  in  Israel.  Across  the  political  spectrum,  from  opposition  leader  Yossi  Sarid  to  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon,  no  one  is  talking  about  renewed  accommodation  with  Arafat.       On  the  contrary,  the  mood  in  Israel  reflects  a  hardening  of  posi-  tions.  This  cannot  be  heartening  to  the  US  State  Department.  Desper-  ately  in  need  of  a  breakthrough  in  the  Middle  East  conflict,  its  policy  since  11  September  has  shifted  from  comatose  disengagement  to  active  mediation  between  the  parties.       The  commitment  of  moderate  Muslim  states  to  the  US  war  against  terrorism  has  been  made  contingent  on  a  movement  toward  Palestinian  statehood.  This  be-  came  abundantly  evident  when  Tony  Blair  became  the  first  British  prime  minister  in  years  to  welcome  Yasser  Arafat  to  Whitehall,  and  when  George  Bush,  who  previous-   ly  had  evinced  not  the  slightest  interest  in  the  Palestinian  cause,  suddenly  lent  his  name  to  the  boosters  for  the  creation  of  a  Pales-  tinian  state.       If  the  US,  which  only  the  day  before  the  Ze’evi  assassination  had  won  a  concession  from  Sharon  for  the  creation,  with  strict  conditions,  of  a  Palestinian  state,  is  seen  to  be  easing  its  pressure  due  to  Israeli  anger,  Muslim  diplomatic  and  logistical  cooperation  in  the  war  against  the  Taliban  in  Afghanistan  may  grind  to  a  halt.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  a  US  drive  for  Palestinian  statehood  continues  unabated,  there  may  be  an  inevitable  rupture  in  its  relationship  with  the  Jewish   state.       But  the  US  should  not  expect  Israel  to  tolerate  the  elimination  of  a  democratically  elected  leader.  The  answer,  finally,  is  not  in  pres-  suring  Israel  to  make  even  further  concessions  or  coddling  Arafat.  It  is  in  recognising  the  Palestinian  leader  as  a  facilitator  of  terror  and  coercing  him,  with  the  aid  of  the  same  Muslim  allies,  to  finally  fulfil  his  commitments  of  eliminating   terror  in  his  own  domain.       Rehavam  Ze’evi  was  known   affectionately  in  Israel  as  Gandhi,  a  remembrance  of,  when  as  a  youth,  he  masqueraded  as  the  Indian  leader.  It  is  a  sad  commentary  on  our  times,  that,  like  his  namesake,  his  death  may  also  occasion  the  outbreak  of  terrible  violence.  Forthright  US  action  and  diplomat-  ic  pressure  may  yet  avert  it.  It  can  only  be  hoped  that  someone  in  the  US  State  Department  recognizes  that  Ze’evi’s  dire  prediction  of  Arafat’s  continued  perpetration  of  terror  is  now  a  tragic  reality.   *      Avi  Davis  is  the  senior  fellow  of  the  Freeman  Centre  for  Strategic  Studies  in  Los  Angeles  and  a  senior  editorial  columnist  for  the  online  magazine  Jewsweek.com ",2001-10-26
"  A  familiar  script  on  the  Temple  Mount   NEWS  ANALYSIS   Serald  EVS  Sfe§ni&gt;®Bfg   un  i  fcjNbfci  clashes  between  Muslims  and  Jews  in  the  area  of  Jerusalem’s  Temple  Mount  (known  to  Muslims  as  the  Haram  al-Sharif)  have  long  been  a  part  of  this  complex  nationalist  and  religious  conflict.  In  1929,  Arab  vio  lence  that  began  at  the  Western  Wall  grew  into  the  Arab  pogrom  in  Hebron  and  the  massacre  of  its  ancient  Jewish  community.  The  echoes  from  these  events  are  still  reverberating  over  70  years  later.   After  1967,  following  19  years  of  Jordanian  occupation  in  which  Jew  ish  sites  were  closed,  desecrated  and  destroyed,  the  pattern  of  clashes  in  Jerusalem  continued,  despite  Moshe  Dayan’s  strict  policy  against  revenge  and  granting  full  religious  autonomy.   The  violence  starts  when  Pales  tinians  on  the  upper  Temple  Mount  area,  which  houses  the  Dome  of  the  Rock  and  the  Aqsa  Mosque,  shower  rocks  on  the  Jewish  worshippers  at  the  Western  Wall  below.  The  rock  throwing  is  excused  as  a  “legitimate  response”  to  the  provocation  pro  vided  by  a  few  dozen  messianic  Jews  exercising  their  right  of  free  speech  and  worship  by  bringing  what  they  proclaim  to  be  the  cornerstone  of  the  Third  Temple  to  the  area.   The  handful  of  extremists  get  dis  proportionate  coverage  from  journal  ists,  aided  by  frenzied  calls  to  the  Muslim  faithful  to  defend  the  holy  Islamic  sites  from  this  bogus  “Jewish  threat”.  The  rock  throwing  begins,  Jewish  worshippers  are  evacuated  and  Israeli  police  enter  the  compound  and  are  attacked.  They  respond,  casu  alties  ensue,  Arab  politicians  blame   the  Jews,  and  Israel  takes  another  public  relations  beating.   The  temperature  increased  last  year,  when  the  Palestinians  took  advantage  of  Ehud  Barak’s  peace  pol  icy  to  close  the  Temple  Mount  to  Jews  and  increased  the  pace  of  con  struction  and  destruction,  reviving  Jewish  memories  of  the  1948-1967  period.  This  paved  the  way  for  Ariel  Sharon’s  demonstrative  visit  at  the  end  of  September  in  which  he  claimed  to  be  restoring  Jewish  rights.  The  riots  and  deaths  marked  the  beginning  of  the  campaign  of  vio  lence  and  terrorism,  and  diverted  Palestinian  criticism  from  Palestinian  Authority  Chairman  Yasser  Arafat’s  corruption  and  dictatorial  methods.   After  10  months,  Arafat  sought  to  repeat  the  process  to  revive  his  flag  ging  support.  Internal  clashes  and  killings  are  spreading,  and  the  PA  fanned  the  flames  in  Jerusalem  to  divert  the  discontent.  This  week,  Tisha  b’Av,  which  has  been  a  Jewish  day  of  mourning  for  over  2,500  years,  provided  a  good  opportunity.  Once  again,  the  inflated  emphasis  on  the  cornerstone  provided  the  excuse,  worshippers  at  the  Western  Wall  were  stoned  from  the  mosques  above,  and  after  they  were  evacuat  ed,  the  Israeli  police  entered  the  Temple  Mount  compound.   This  time,  careful  Israeli  prepara  tions  and  measured  responses  pre  vented  deaths  and  serious  injuries.   In  addition,  relatively  few  Palestini  ans  answered  the  call  to  arms  issued  by  the  PA  and  the  Muslim  authori  ties.  Arafat’s  tactic  of  turning  on  the  heat  in  Jerusalem  to  divert  internal  criticism  and  tension  may  have  become  overly  transparent,  even  to  the  Palestinians.   However,  Jerusalem  remains  a  source  of  major  instability,  as  Mus  lim  and  Palestinian  officials  keep  the  Temple  Mount  closed,  and  construc  tion  continues  in  secret,  fuelling  reports  of  gross  destruction  of  Jew  ish  sites.  Every  action  in  Jerusalem  eventually  has  an  equal  and  oppo  site  reaction,  and  the  current  situa  tion  is  extremely  explosive.  This  week’s  events  may  have  been  con  tained,  but  as  long  as  the  situation  remains  unchanged,  the  tension  will   grow.

"  Terrorism:  the  new  ‘ism’   The  Islamic  world   must  fight  militant  Islamism,  writes  Saul  Singer.   IT  is  beginning  to  sink  in  that   what  happened  on  11  September  was  not  a  single  terrorist  attack  on  a  single  country,  but  the  Pearl  Harbour  of  Islamism  in  its  war  against  the  West.  In  1941,  Ameri  cans  were  surprised  by  the  Japan  ese  attack,  but  at  least  knew  what  and  where  Japan  was.   In  retrospect,  the  great  defeated  “isms”  of  the  last  century,  Nazism  and  communism,  are  well  under  stood.  Now  we  are  groping  for  an  understanding  of  the  new  “ism”  that  has  declared  war  on  us.   The  first  shocker,  of  course,  is  that  someone  is  out  to  get  the  West  in  the  first  place.  For  the  past  decade,  the  West  has  been  operating  under  a  paradigm  characterised  by  the  title  of  Francis  Fukuyama’s  cele  brated  article,  “The  End  of  History?”  (National  Interest,  1989).  As  Fukuya  ma  put  it  then,  “We  are  witnessing  not  just  the  end  of  the  Cold  War,  or  a  passing  of  a  particular  period  of  his  tory,  but  the  end  of  history  as  such:  that  is  the  end  point  of  mankind’s  ideological  evolution  and  the  univer  salisation  of  western  liberal  democ  racy  as  the  final  form  of  human  government.”   Just  as  this  new  paradigm  was  settling  in,  Harvard  Professor  Samuel  Huntington  wrote  a  blazingly  contrary  article  that  now  looks  pre  scient.  In  “The  Clash  of  Civiliza   tions?”  (Foreign  Affairs,  1993),  Huntington  suggested  the  conflicts  that  had  dominated  the  20th  century  were  essentially  “western  civil  wars”,  while  this  century  would  be  dominated  by  conflicts  between  the  West  and  other  civilisations,  prima  rily  the  Islamic  world.   “The  West’s  next  confrontation,”  according  to  M  J  Akbar,  an  Indian  Muslim  author  quoted  by  Hunting  ton,  “is  definitely  going  to  come  from   the  Muslim  world.  It  is  in  the  sweep  of  the  Islamic  nations  from  the  Maghreb  to  Pakistan  that  the  strug  gle  for  a  new  world  order  will  begin.”   Huntington  predicted  the  1,300  year-old  conflict  between  Islam  and  the  West,  far  from  declining,  “could  become  more  virulent”.  The  full  blown  revival  of  this  conflict  is  Osama  bin  Laden’s  dream.  It  is  no  coincidence  he  describes  his  enemy  as  “Judeo-Crusaders”,  accurately  lumping  together  two  former  foes,  while  recalling  the  ancient  Christian  wars  against  Islam.   Does  this  mean  the  West  is  now  at  war  with  Islam?  Not  yet,  not  exactly.  In  some  ways,  Islamists  such  as  bin  Laden  understand  the  situation  much  better  than  we  do.  They  realise  the  struggle  is  whether  Islamism  —  a  militant,  politicised  form  of  Islam  —  or  western  liberal  democracy  will  define  the  political   structure  of  the  Islamic  world.   In  this  struggle,  the  West  has  an  enormous  head  start.  Islamists  pro  vide  no  cultural  competition  within  the  West,  but  the  West  is  a  pro  found  source  of  attraction  and   influence  within  the  Islamic  world.  All  the  Islamists  have  to  offer  is  war,  oppression  and  stagnation,  while  the  West  represents  the  opposite.   Judaism  and  Christianity  both  went  through  militant  phases,  but  outgrew  them  many  centuries  ago.  The  “end  of  history”  paradigm  pre  tended  that  Islam’s  militant  phase  was  similarly  buried,  but  that  was  a  tad  optimistic.  Now  the  question  is  whether  or  not  the  Islamic  world  can,  as  Judaism  and  Christianity  did,  reinvent  itself  in  a  manner  consis  tent  with  modernity.   It  is  not  enough  for  the  Muslim  political  and  religious  leaders  to  con  demn  terrorism,  they  must  provide  positive  competition  to  militant  Islamism.  The  founder  of  modern  Turkey,  Kamal  Ataturk,  provided  such  a  positive  vision,  melding  Islam  and  democracy.  But  such  voices  are  few  and  far  between  in  the  Arab  world  and  other  places  infected  with   Islamism.   13  Saul  Singer  is  a  columnist  for  the   Jerusalem  Post. ",2001-09-28
"  ‘Vote  to  restore  the  ABC’   Vic  Alhadef?   WHEN  members  of  the  Jewish  community  cast  their  votes,  they  should  think  of  the  ABC,  Friends  of  the  ABC  NSW  president  Penelope  Toltz  urged  this  week.   “The  ABC  has  been  hard  done  by  by  both  major  parties  in  the  last  15  years.  Labor  took  $100m  out  of  it  over  10  years,  and  the  Coal  ition  has  taken  $66m  out  in  18  months.”   A  social  activist  and  member  of  the  Jewish  community,  Ms  Toltz  emphasised  that  she  was  not  advocating  which  party  people  should  vote  for,  but  it  was  vital  that  the  Senate  “remain  a  house  of  review,  not  a  rubber  stamp  for  the  Lower  House”.   “This  means  putting  parties  other  than  the  two  major  ones  into  the  Senate.”   Speaking  in  the  wake  of  ABC  managing  director  Jonathan  Schier’s  resignation,  Ms  Toltz  said  it  was  imperative  that  the  national  broadcaster  remain  able  to  implement  its  charter  —  to  inform  and  educate.   “We’re  going  through  difficult  times,  and  we  can  rely  on  the  ABC  for  independent  analysis  and  information,  and  for  more  than  one  viewpoint,”  she  said.   “Phillip  Adams  spoke  to  Muslim  academics  about  how  the  Taliban  version  of  Islam  varies  from  orthodox  Islam.  And  the  ABC’s  Bush  Telegraph  interviewed  a  Muslim  woman  about  how  her  kids  are  treated  in  the  playground  since  September  11,  with  others  avoiding  them  because  their  mother  wears  a  scarf.  Maybe  people  will  think  twice  after  hearing   the  interview.   “On  ABC  you  don’t  get  the  heat  or  prejudice  you  get  from  shock-jocks.”   The  ABC  needs  $200m,  Ms  Toltz  said.  “Its  core  funding  was  ripped  to  shreds  in  1996-97  by  the  Howard  government;  Kim  Beazley  has   Penelope  Tottz   offered  it  $100m  over  three  years  —  which  is  only  half  what  it  needs  right  now.   “In  the  1980s  the  ABC  made  100  hours  of  drama  a  year;  this  year  it  has  produced  less  than  10,  with  none  on  the  drawing-board.  The  funds  have  been  slashed  and  people  have  been  sacked.  There’s  no-one  left  to  do  it.   “So  think  ABC  when  you  vote.” ",2001-11-09
"  Why  Tisha  b’Av  is  politicised   The  traditional   commemoration  of   the  destruction  of  the  temple,  which  falls  this  Sunday,  is   particularly  poignant  this  year,  writes  Daniel  Lourie.   MANY  years  ago,  when  I  was   living  in  the  Diaspora  of  Melbourne,  I  recall  writing  to  the  chief  rabbis  of  Israel,  on  the  fas  cinating  topic  of  mourning  during  the  three  weeks  leading  up  to  Tisha   b’Av.   I  posed  the  obvious  question  of  “Why  still  today?”  With  600,000  peo  ple  living  in  a  united  Jerusalem,  with  building  construction,  Torah  institu  tions,  schools,  parks,  gardens,  our  own  government  sitting  in  the  Knes  set,  with  all  this  redemption  before  our  own  eyes,  why  do  we  still  have  to  mourn  in  the  period  up  to  and  including  the  Ninth  of  Av?  Surely,  the  times  have  changed.  I  believed  then  we  were  in  the  time  of  the  messiah.  It  was  time  to  look  again  and  even  adjust  the  customs  and  some  of  the  wording  of  the  literature.   The  rabbis  wrote  back,  acknowl  edging  the  small  but  important  steps  in  the  process  of  physical  redemp  tion  but  arguing  that  without  com  plete  Jewish  control  on  Mount  Moriah  (the  Temple  Mount),  and  without  the  unique  spiritual  life  sur  rounding  the  Third  and  Final  Temple  Jerusalem  is  still  effectively  in  ruins.   At  the  time  I  must  admit  I  wasn’t  greatly  convinced.  But  as  I  write  these  words  in  the  same  semi  mourning  period  of  the  three  weeks   I  can  see  how  the  rabbis’  approach  has  been  proven  true.   After  generations  of  suffering  and  perecution,  we  may  have  returned  to  this  land  and  have  established  the  State  of  Israel.  But  this  period  is  still   a  mournful  one  and  we  have  more  reasons  than  in  previous  years  to  weep  on  Tisha  b’Av.  This  year  we  will  all  feel  the  pain  and  the  loss  of  the  temple,  and  the  lost  Jewish  con  trol  and  sovereignity  in  this  land.  Beneath  our  very  noses,  the  Temple  Mount  is  becoming  wrenched  from  our  hands,  and  we  seem  to  be  help  less  to  respond.  For  generations,  we  have  seen  foreign  conquerors  come  and  destroy  Jerusalem  and  dese  crate  the  mount  and  the  site  of  our  temple,  but  then  we  were  in  exile.  Today,  this  is  happening  in  our  land,   within  our  state.   Jews  are  not  permitted  in  groups  onto  the  mount  (even  in  areas  where  it  is  allowed  according  to  certain  Jewish  law).  Jews  are  not  permitted  to  pray  on  the  Temple  Mount.  When  religious  Jews  do  go  onto  the  mount  they  are  are  usually  “accompanied”  by  a  Wa^MusIim  guard  to  ensure  that  they  don’t  “desecrate”  the  site,  by  uttering  a  blessing.  In  fact  there  hasn’t  been  a  Jewish  visitor  to  the  site  for  months.   There  is  rampant  destruction  of  Jewish  heritage  and  Jewish  archeolog  ical  treasures,  as  a  result  of  digging,  restoration,  construction  and  building  by  the  Muslim  Authority.  The  Waqf  (after  sifting  through  the  archeological  debris)  dumped  tons  of  soil  outside  the  Old  City.  A  massive  stone  cutter  has  been  brought  onto  the  mount  by  the  Waqf,  and  has  been  used  exten  sively  for  cutting  stones,  creating  a  secondary  usage,  and  thus  eradicating  any  semblance  of  its  primary  usage  from  early  Jewish  periods.   In  the  Old  City  itself,  the  Jewish  residents  of  the  Old  Yishuv-Kotel  Quarter  (today  known  as  the  Muslim  and  Christian  Quarters)  have  at  times  found  themselves  under  cur   The  Temple  Mount,  site  of  a  mosque  and  soldiers,  Is  still  beyond  Jewish  hands.   Photo:  Isranet   few  and  seige.  Molotov  cocktails  have  been  thrown  at  Jewish  houses  in  this  area  during  the  night  over  the  last  few  tense  months.   A  few  weeks  ago,  during  the  funer  al  procession  of  Faisel  Husseini,  “the  keys  of  Jerusalem”  were  handed  over  to  the  Muslim  authority  (including  thugs  from  the  Palestinian  Authori  ty),  and  hundreds  of  marauding  Arab  youth.  As  a  result  of  this  subjugation  and  weakness  —  Jewish  property  was  destroyed,  windows  of  a  syna  gogue  were  smashed,  the  Israeli  flag  drapping  over  the  house  of  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  was  torn  and  burnt,  more  than  70  Israeli  police  sur  veillance  cameras  were  destroyed.  One  Jewish  area  found  itself  in  the  midst  of  a  “pogrom”,  with  windows  broken  by  the  violent  Arab  gangs.  This  is  all  taking  place  in  the  capital  city  of  Israel  —  Jerusalem.   In  our  own  walled  city  of  Jerusalem,  we  are  a  minority,  with  the  smallest  of  the  “quarters”.  A  hun  dred  years  ago  we  were  a  thriving  majority  in  the  Old  City,  what  is  today  the  Muslim  Quarter  was  the  hub  of  Jewish  life  and  activity.  Today  Arab  terrorism  and  hatred  dictate  our  every  move,  and  shatter  the   lives  of  hundreds  of  Jewish  families.  This  is  indeed  a  period  of  mourning,   sadness  and  trouble  for  the  Jewish  people,  for  those  on  the  front-line  here  in  Israel,  and  for  those  who  feel  and  identify  with  our  pain  and  trou   bles  from  afar.   This  year,  on  Tisha  B’Av,  as  in  previous  years,  I  will  be  sitting  on  the  age-old  Jerusalem  stones  at  the  footsteps  of  Mount  Moriah,  looking  at  the  outer  retaining  wall  of  the  Temple  Mount  —  the  Kotel.   Every  word  of  the  ancient  scroll  of  Eichah  (Lamentations)  will  have  real  significance  to  me  and  to  the  Jewish  world.   May  we  all  learn  from  the  past,  and  look  towards  a  positive  and  bright  future,  and  may  we  all  merit  to  witness  the  true  rebuilding  of  Jerusalem,  and  Israel  in  our  days.   ®  Daniel  Lourie  is  public  relations  spokesman  for  Ateret  Cohanim,  an  organisation  which  promotes  Jewish  settlement  in  the  Old  City  of   Jerusalem.

"  Truth  is  clear   IT  takes  time  for  newspapers  to  turn  yellow  and  for  memories  to  fade.  But  some  Jews  sympathetic  to  Palest  inian  leader  Yasser  Arafat  are  not  waiting;  they  have  launched  an  ambi  tious  public  relations  campaign  to  revise  the  still-fresh  history  of  the  “peace  process”  of  2000.   What  happened  last  year  is  simple.  Under  pressure  from  then-US  President,  Bill  Clinton,  then-Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  offered  a  deal  more  generous,  more  risky  and  far  beyond  what  anyone  expected.   Arafat  would  now  have  over  97  per  cent  of  Gaza,  Judea  and  Samaria,  with  Eastern  Jerusalem  as  its  capital.  Instead  of  seizing  a  historic  opportu  nity,  he  chose  not  only  to  spit  in  the  faces  of  Barak  and  Clinton,  he   launched  a  mini-war.   Against  this  backdrop,  two  presen  ters  at  the  Jewish  Free  University’s  “Jerusalem:  One  City  Two  Capitals”  forum  (Hakoah  Club  19/8/01)  left  me  speechless  —  Dr  Ruth  Firer  and  Benjamin  Rutland.  In  unison  with  Arafat’s  comrades,  they  praised  the  Muslim  attachment  to  Jerusalem  (how  many  times  does  the  name  Jerusalem  feature  in  the  Koran?)   Dr  Firer,  of  that  staunchly  leftist  institution,  the  Hebrew  University,  went  one  better  when  she  tried  to  delegitimise  the  Jewish  connection  to  the  Old  City,  saying  it  contains  fewer  Jewish  historical  sites  than  Muslim  or  even  Christian  sites.  The  fact  that  Yerushalayim  has  been  the  pivot  around  which  Judaism  has  revolved  for  millennia  was  lost  in  the  delusion.   Both  speakers  (sadly,  they  are  not  alone)  turned  a  deaf  ear  when  the  former  US  Ambassador  of  Middle  Eastern  Affairs  —  he  of  the  peaceniks  —  Dennis  Ross,  dismissed  the  revi  sionist  argument  that  Arafat  avoids  making  hard  decisions,  even  when  he  could  achieve  all  but  total  victory.   Or  what  about  Mr  Barak’s  lament  last  year  —  “Arafat  cheated  us  all”.   The  sad  truth  is  clear.  The  Arabs  chose  not  to  make  peace  and  estab  lish  an  independent  Palestinian  state  alongside  Israel  because  they  seek  to  establish  an  independent  state  in  place  of  Israel.  Most  of  us  were  awake  when  Arafat  made  that  decision.  Where  were  Mr  Rutland  and  Dr  Firer?   Jonathan  Ariel   Darling  Point,  NSW ",2001-09-07

"  US  ambassador  sought  comfort  at  Canberra’s  Jewish  Centre   Bernard  FMman   NEW  Yorker  Gary  Fellman  was  con  ducting  his  fortnightly  adult  educa  tion  class  on  Judaism  at  Canberra’s   National  Jewish  Centre  last  Sunday  week,  when  an  unexpected  guest   arrived.   American  Ambassador  Tom  Schi  effer,  just  back  from  Washington  where  he  had  witnessed  the  terrorist  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Centre  and  the  Pentagon,  had  come  to  the  centre  with  his  wife  and  son.   As  he  later  told  a  service  of  com  memoration  and  thanksgiving  attended  by  more  than  2,000  people  at  Parliament  House,  Mr  Schieffer  went  to  the  Jewish  Centre  to  seek  comfort  from  a  “higher  being”  in  the  aftermath  of  the  attacks  in  America,  which  claimed  more  than  6,000  lives.   At  the  centre,  Mr  Schieffer  was  served  a  bagel  and  lox  and  apple  and  honey  to  mark  Rosh  Hashanah.  He  described  his  experience  in  Washing  ton  where  he  was  present  during  the  visit  of  Prime  Minister  John  Howard,  telling  the  group  he  had  called  on  Mr  Howard  who  had  been  moved  to  secure  quarters  in  the  Australian  Embassy  after  the  hijacked  aircraft  smashed  into  the  Pentagon.

"  Check  bin  Laden  support  groups:  diplomat   Bernard  Freedman   AN  Australian  diplomat  currently  with  the  Australian  Defence  College  has  suggested  the  United  States  might  do  better  in  fighting  terrorism  by  check  ing  on  funds  from  Muslim  charities  going  to  Osama  bin  Laden  terrorists  than  taking  “a  firmer  approach  to  Israel”  to  please  Arab  states.   Dr  Robert  Bowker,  long  experi  enced  as  a  Foreign  Affairs  Depart  ment  authority  on  the  Middle  East,  was  speaking  last  week  in  a  panel   discussion  on  international  terror   ism  and  the  Afghanistan  problem,  organised  by  the  Australian  National  University’s  Centre  for  Arab  and   Islamic  Studies.   He  said  a  firmer  United  States  approach  to  Israel  on  the  issue  of  settlements,  assassinations  and  col  lective  punishments  might  play  a  part  in  sustaining  co-operation  of  Arab  governments  with  US  goals  in  the  Arab  world,  but  it  “would  not  make  much  difference  to  the  root  of  the  terrorist  problem  originating  with  the  bin  Laden  organisation”.   There  were  groups  within  migrant  communities  in  Western  countries  supporting  bin  Laden.  Many  had  a  continuing  and  active  concern  for  Arab  and  Islamic  politi  cal  issues  and  were  in  contact  with  the  global  network  of  like-minded  political  activists.   “Their  attitudes  are  shaped  by  frustration  with  Israeli  behaviour  in  the  struggle  with  the  Palestinians  and  the  perception  that  such  behav  iour  is  aided  by  the  role  of  the  Unit   ed  States,”  Dr  Bowker  said.   “They  are  tuned  into  anti-Jewish  rhetoric  which  flourishes  through  the  Internet  and  in  other  forums  where  Islamic  groups  tend  to  gather.  These  calls  also  circulate  in  the  West  in  Arabic  language  media  material,  the  conferences  of  Muslim  youth  groups  and  on  the  Internet.”   Dr  Bowker  said  there  was  a  remarkable  record  of  illegal  fund  raising  in  the  United  States  by  Hezbollah  supporters  using  ciga  rette  smuggling  and  excise  duty  eva  sion,  visa  brokerage  facilities  and  a  number  of  other  devices  well-known  to  the  sort  of  networks  which  might  be  supporting  bin  Laden.   “Financial  flows  in  particular  are  easily  disguised  among  the  $500  bil  lion  to  $1.5  trillion  of  illicit  money  —  up  to  five  percent  of  gross  world  product  —  that  moves  around  the  globe  annually,”  he  said.   “There  is  a  particular  problem  with  Islamic  charities  and  founda  tions  which  are  a  commendable  and  valuable  part  of  the  Arab  tradition  of  philanthropy.   “These  foundations  and  charities  are  loosely  structured  and  they  are  largely  unscrutinised  in  terms  of  their  operations.  They  channel  funds  to  locations  where  Muslims  are  perceived  to  be  at  risk.   “Where  that  involves  the  move  ment  of  funds  to  the  Horn  of  Africa,  to  Lebanon,  to  the  Philippines,  West  Bank  and  Gaza,  and  other  such  places  where  dispersal  is  even  less  able  to  be  monitored  than  in  the  West,  we  have  a  serious  problem.”   “The  sophisticated  insider  share  trading,  that  appears  to  have  accom  panied  the  11  September  attacks,  reinforces  my  suspicions  on  that  score,”  Dr  Bowker  said.   Professor  Stuart  Harris,  a  former  Foreign  Affairs  Department  head  now  with  the  International  Relations  Department  in  the  Australian  Nation  al  University  Research  School  of  Pacific  and  Asian  Studies,  said  Aus  tralia  needed  an  anti-terrorism  policy  separate  from  a  Middle  East  policy  as  there  had  been  a  lot  of  terrorism  over  the  last  15  or  20  years  in  a  lot  of  places  that  had  nothing,  or  very  little,  to  do  with  the  Middle  East.   “If  we  are  going  to  have  a  war  on  terrorism  it  is  here  to  stay,""  he  said.  “It’s  not  a  military  operation,  it’s  a  law  and  order  operation.  That’s  what  we  have  to  be  gearing  our  selves  up  to  handle.  It  has  to  be  in  a  globally  inclusive  way  and  not  [con  fined  to]  a  small  number  of  allies  of  the  United  States.”   Professor  Harris  accused  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  of  lacking   concern  about  Australian  Muslims.   “The  Prime  Minister  has  said  we  should  not  demonise  Australian  Muslims  and  on  the  other  hand  he  has  done  nothing  else  but  that,”  he  said.  “No  symbolic  gesture  towards  the  Muslim  community.  No  consult  ing  with  their  leaders  in  a  formal  and  public  manner.”   Foreign  Minister  Alexander  Downer  had  at  least  gone  out  to  an  Islamic  college  in  South  Australia  which  was  “a  good  step,  but  more  than  that  should  have  been  done.” ",2001-10-19
"  Global  shtetl   Jews,  Arabs  unite  for  90  minutes   SOCCER  can  do  things  that  even  diplomats  and  peace  makers  can’t  do  —  bring  complete  (albeit  temporary)  peace  between  Israelis  and  Arabs.

"  No  right  to  pass  such  motions   EXTRACT  of  an  open  letter  to  the  general  secretary  of  the  NSW   Teachers’  Federation:   We  have  been  members  of  the  NSW  Teachers’  Federation  since   the  beginning  of  our  careers,  rang  ing  from  30  years  ago  to  the  pres  ent.  Often  we  have  applauded  the  union’s  fight  for  improving  public   education  and  teachers’  conditions   and  felt  grateful  that  we  live  in  a  country  where  such  institutions  can  flourish.   Nevertheless,  we  feel  obliged  to  unequivocally  condemn  the  action  of  the  members  of  the  Teachers’   Federation  who  signed  a  motion  in  which  they  accused  Israel  of  ethnic  cleansing  and  apartheid,  emotive  words  that  only  serve  the  purpose  of  increasing  the  antisemitic  feel  ings  already  prevalent  in  Australia  and  which  have  greatly  increased  during  the  past  12  months.   Many  synagogues  have  been  fire  bombed,  houses  graffiti-ed  with  hateful  slogans  and  people  bashed   and  threatened.   Not  only  does  the  union’s  con  demnation  incite  hatred  towards  Israelis  and  Jews  in  the  Diaspora,  they  implant  erroneous  ideas  in  the  minds  of  an  impressionable  public.   Has  the  federation  any  idea  that  just  before  the  intifada,  Israeli  PM  Ehud  Barad  offered  95  per  cent  of  all  that  the  Palestinians  had  requested?  Arafat  answered  by  ini  tiating  the  bloodiest  violence  since  the  80s.   Does  it  know  that  Palestinian  schoolchildren  are  bombarded   with  anti-Israeli  propaganda  and  taught  to  envisage  a  map  of  the  Middle  East  without  Israel?   Does  the  federation  have  any  idea  that  Israel  has  taken  in  over   400,000  Jewish  refugees  driven  out   of  their  Muslim  homelands?  On  the  other  hand,  Palestinian  refugees  fleeing  from  Israel  have  been  kept  in  squalid  camps  by  their  Muslim  brothers  so  that  they  could  be  used  as  pawns  in  the  conflict?   The  union  condemns  Israel  for  trying  to  protect  its  citizens  against  terrorists  who  blow  up  innocent  women  and  children.  Unlike  the  Israelis,  who  target  terrorist  groups,  the  Palestinians  target   civilians  in  order  to  cause  fear  and   panic  among  the  general  popula   tion.   Will  the  federation  also  condemn  the  USA  for  trying  to  destroy  the  perpetrators  of  September  11?   The  NSW  Teachers’  Federation  should  confine  itself  to  dealing  with  issues  that  affect  public  edu  cation  and  stay  out  of  matters  that  do  not  concern  them,  and  of  which  they  are  ignorant.   Finally,  it  has  no  right  to  pass   motions  without  consultation  with  all  its  members,  especially  in  mat  ters  that  concern  the  existence  of  an  entire  nation  and  the  safety  of  Jews  all  over  New  South  Wales.   ^usan  Hotbauer,  Zina  isorelick,  Lia  Krutik   Sydney,  NSW ",2001-11-09

"  Wahid’s  bridge  building   VIEWPOINT   Colin  SSubons&amp;oin   THERE  is  little  doubt  that   Indonesia’s  President  Abdur  rahman  Wahid,  as  his  Aus  tralian  meetings  last  week  demonstrated,  is  a  remarkable  leader  of  profound  erudition,  pos  sesses  a  warm  and  humorous  per  sonality  and  is  invested  with  enormous  moral  stature  that  can  only  be  a  considerable  asset  for  his  nation  both  at  home  and  abroad.  He  is  a  genuine  democrat  committed  to  an  inclusive  society  who  has  embarked  on  a  brave  and  admirable  course  of  democratisation  that  is  important  not  only  for  Indonesia,  but  is  also  of  great  international  signifi  cance.  His  determination  to  strength  en  ties  with  Australia  was  certainly  a  very  welcome  message  that  was  warmly  received  and  reciprocated.   As  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  aptly  remarked,  the  courage  and  resolve  demonstrated  by  the  presi  dent  in  visiting  Australia  despite  his   severe  domestic  difficulties  earned  him  the  genuine  admiration  of  his  Australian  hosts.  Opposition  leader  Kim  Beazley  astutely  noted  that  Wahid’s  visit  on  25  and  26  June  was  probably  the  most  important  visit  to  our  shores  by  a  foreign  leader  in   recent  times.   Indeed,  the  warm  reception  he  received  from  the  political  and  busi  ness  communities,  and  in  the  media,  as  a  tolerant  and  inclusive  leader  of  a  country  embracing  democracy,  demonstrated  he  was  successful  in  establishing  a  new  psychology  and  momentum  for  an  enhanced  and  mature  relationship  based  on  com  mon  interests.  Now  that  the  logjam  in  ties  has  been  broken,  Australia’s  prime  minister  will  visit  Jakarta  as  soon  as  possible  after  the  federal  elec  tion  later  this  year  and  the  leaders  of  both  nations  will  meet  regularly.   President  Wahid  was  generous  in  his  praise  of  Australia’s  political  sta  bility  and  democracy,  its  media  cov  erage  of  East  Timor  and  the  way  in   which  it  has  been  inclusive  with  regards  to  its  diverse  ethnic  and  reli  gious  communities  —  Australia’s  successful  multiculturalism  —  all  areas  from  which  he  hoped  Indone   sia  could  learn.   The  president  repeatedly  demon  strated  his  commitment  to  promot  ing  pluralism,  tolerance  and  mutual  respect  between  different  faiths  and  peoples,  his  Sydney  dialogue  with  inter-faith  leaders  being  typical  in  this  regard  (with  several  Jewish  participants).   “Wahid’s  open  preference  for   the  establishment  of  full   relations  with  Israel...   sets  him  apart  from  the  great  majority  of  Muslim   heads  of  state.”   Indeed,  it  is  his  efforts  to  promote  a  tolerant  society  and  an  inclusive  model  of  Islam  encompassing  democracy  and  the  rule  of  law  which  have  made  him  so  widely  admired  internationally.  His  respect  and  warmth  for  the  Jewish  world  and  attempts  to  promote  improved  rela  tions  with  Israel,  which  he  visited  on  several  occasions  before  becoming  leader,  have  also  won  him  the  appre  ciation  of  the  international  Jewish  community  and  Jerusalem.   Indeed,  Wahid’s  open  preference  for  the  establishment  of  full  relations  with  Israel  —  one  of  his  first  com   ments  upon  assuming  the  presiden  cy  —  sets  him  apart  from  the  great  majority  of  Muslim  heads  of  state.   That  Wahid  is  also  a  Muslim  cleric  makes  his  enlightened  view  even  more  significant  and  particularly  important  with  the  emergence  of  more  radical  Islamist  elements  in  Indonesian  politics  in  recent  times.  His  stance  on  Israel  has,  not  surpris  ingly,  provoked  reactions  by  Islamic  hard-liners  and  “go  slow”  advice  from  his  rival,  Consultative  Assem  bly  speaker  Amien  Rais,  but  he  stands  by  his  view  that  such  ties  would  be  beneficial  for  his  country.   Wahid  once  told  the  Voice  of  Israel  radio  of  Indonesia’s  need  for  investment  “and  you  know,  the  Jew  ish  community  everywhere  is  very   active  in  the  commercial  lives  of  the  nations  we  would  like  to  have  invest  ments  from”.  Accordingly,  trade  and  other  informal  ties  have  been  expanding.  Last  year,  a  large  delega  tion  of  Indonesian  businesspeople  included  a  visit  to  Israel  in  their  Mid  dle  Eastern  tour,  one  of  whom  pre  dicted  that  trade  between  the  two  countries  could  reach  $500  million  within  three  years.  There  has  also  been  interest  in  obtaining  Israeli  defence  technology.  Wahid  main  tains  his  intention  to  engage  more  fully  with  Jerusalem  but  with  his  typ  ical  candour,  admits  that  “in  the  short  run  we’ll  have  to  take  into  account  the  reactions  in  Indonesia”.   Facing  a  political  showdown  on  1  August  with  Indonesia’s  People’s  Consultative  Assembly,  the  experts  suggest  President  Wahid’s  political  future  may  appear  problematic.  However,  with  corruption  charges  against  him  now  dismissed  and  the  constitutional  grounds  for  those  who  would  impeach  him  under  mined,  Wahid  is  confident  that  a  compromise  solution  enabling  him  to  continue  his  presidential  term  until  its  completion  in  2004  will  still   be  achieved.   II  Dr  Colin  Rubenstein,  executive  director  of  A1JAC,  met  with  President  Wahid  during  his  visit  to  Canberra. ",2001-07-06

"  Nothing  to  do  with  racism   VIEWPOINT   Bob  RH^ggdl   I  MUST  express  consternation  at   the  insulting  accusation  that  most  Australians  are  cold  hearted,  racist  rednecks  because  we  oppose  illegal  immigration.   Does  this  attitude  represent  the  majority  of  the  Jewish  community?  Or  do  others  believe,  as  I  do,  that  the  major  parties  appealed  not  to  racism,  but  to  voters’  commonsense?   Are  all  those  opposed  to  a  permissive  policy  regarding  illegal  immigration  bigots?  Take  my  office  —  three  Asians,  a  Chilean,  a  Kiwi,  three  Australians  and  me,  a  China  born  Jew.  Our  religions  include  Catholicism,  Protestantism,  Baha’ism  and  Judaism.

We  reject  One  Nation  and  me  critical  of  John  Howard  for  not  taking  a  firmer  stance  on  Pauline  Hanson.  Yet  most  of  us  support  the  policy  on  illegal  immigration.

In  the  case  of  the  boat  people,  as   soon  as  those  who  faced  persecution  left  their  country,  they  were  free  from  danger.  So  the  issue  is  not  whether  they  suffered,  but  whether  they  should  have  a  right  to  impose  themselves  on  any  country  they  choose.   Most  people  live  in  poverty  under  oppressive  governments.  We  cannot  let  them  all  in.  We  should  have  a  generous  refugee  policy,  but  the  decision  regarding  who  we  welcome  must  be  our  right.   The  crux  of  the  problem  is  that  these  people  are  nearly  all  Arabs  and  other  Muslims.  Would  it  have  been  racist  if  we  refused  to  open   the  floodgates  at  the  end  of  World  War  II  to  illegal  German  immigrants?  Many  would  have  suffered,  but  among  them  would  be  former  Gestapo,  SS  officers  and  other  war  criminals.   The  public  sees  hatred  of  the  West  in  the  Arab  and  Muslim  world;  rejoicing  at  the  destruction  of  the  World  Trade  Centre;  crowds  expressing  the  hope  that  bin  Laden  will  use  weapons  of  mass  destruction  on  the  infidels  —  you  and  me;  mosques  where  preachers  exhort  congregations  to  kill  Americans  and  Jews;  Baha’i  leaders  executed  in  Iran.   It  is  therefore  understandable  that  the  public  is  wary  of  immigrants  from  Arab  and  Muslim  countries,  particularly  those  who  enter  illegally.  It  is  not  racism,  but  fear  of  importing  extremism  and  fanaticism,  compounded  by  concern  that  people  who  enter  illegally  are  unlikely  to  make  law  abiding  citizens.   These  concerns  have  nothing  to  do  with  racism.  Arabs  and  Muslims  who  have  a  worldview  complementary  to  ours  would  be  welcome.  As  long  as  immigrants  and  refugees  are  likely  to  play  a  constructive  role  in  society,  they  will  be  welcome.  If  there  is  a  risk  that  they  will  disrupt  our  way  of  life,  they  won’t  be.   We  have  every  right  to  insist  that  we,  not  the  people-smuggling  syndicates,  decide  who  is  welcome  and  who  is  not  —  a  view  endorsed  by  the  majority  of  Australians  in  the  election.

"  abbat  shalom   The  destruction  continues   The  Temple  Mount:  still  disputed.   Photo:  Isranet   The  Romans  have  long  departed,  but  the  process  of   “destruction  of  the  temple”  has  not  yet  ended,  suggests  a   recent  editorial  in  the  Jerusalem  Post.   IF  there  is  an  accusation  that  cap   tures  popular  cynicism  toward  politics,  it  is  the  aphorism  “where  you  stand  depends  on  where  you   sit”.   Some  politicians,  however,  man  age  to  develop  reputations  of  adher  ing  to  principle,  even  at  the  possible  expense  of  their  popularity.  Internal  Security  Minister  Uzi  Landau  was  considered  such  a  straight  shooter,  so  it  is  particularly  disturbing  to  see  his  180-degree  turnabout  on  the  issue  of  protecting  antiquities  on  the  Temple  Mount.   Under  the  premiership  of  Ehud  Barak,  Landau  was  one  of  the  loud  est  voices  protesting  against  the  government’s  disregard  for  the  wan  ton  and  unsupervised  destruction  of  antiquities  on  the  Temple  Mount  by  the  Waqf  which  was  engaged  in  seemingly  endless  construction  projects  there.  Landau  probably  did  not  imagine  that  within  months  he  would  be  the  minister  of  internal  security,  and  therefore  would  have  a  pivotal  role  in  ensuring  that  such  destruction  did  not  continue.   The  fact  that  Landau’s  role  is  so  pivotal  is  one  of  the  problems  he  was  meant  to  solve.  Since  last  Sep  tember,  the  Israel  Police  and  the  Wakf  have  together  blocked  all  non  Muslims  from  entering  the  Temple  Mount.  This  prohibition  includes  archaeologists  from  the  Antiquities  Authority  and  all  journalists  —  except  those  hand-picked  by  the  Waqf.  The  police,  therefore,  are  the  only  thin  reed  by  which  the  outside  world  knows  anything  about  what  ever  construction  is  taking  place  on   the  mount.   Just  last  week,  the  Committee  to  Prevent  the  Destruction  of  Antiqui  ties  on  the  Temple  Mount,  a  non-par  tisan  group  of  archaeologists,  authors,  and  public  figures,  released  photographs  of  heavy  equipment  working  in  this  sensitive  area,  and  a  large  saw  used  to  cut  massive   ancient  stones  for  reuse  in  construc  tion  projects.  The  committee  has  repeatedly  charged  that  the  police  have  misinformed  the  public  and  its  minister  as  to  the  extent  of  the  work  going  on,  and  has  demanded  that  the  area  be  open  to  the  press  and  sub  ject  to  archaeological  supervision.  The  committee  further  claims  that,  contrary  to  an  assurance  by  Landau  this  week  in  the  Knesset,  the  saw  is  still  being  used,  large  amounts  of   construction  materials  have  been  brought  in,  and  hundreds  of  volun  teers  from  the  Islamic  movement  have  been  working  on  construction  projects  on  the  mount.   Last  week,  for  only  the  second  time  since  the  formation  of  the  gov  ernment,  and  only  after  significant  attention  by  the  press  and  the  Knes  set,  Landau  finally  met  with  the  com  mittee  to  review  the  evidence  it  has  collected.  So  far  Prime  Minister  Ariel   Sharon,  the  heads  of  the  Antiquities  Authority,  the  police,  and  Education  Minister  Limor  Livnat  (who  has  juris  diction  over  the  Antiquities  Authori  ty)  have  all  refused  to  meet  with  the   committee.   “It  is  absurd,  even  pathetic,   that  Israel  and  the  world  must  rely  upon  smuggled  and  aerial  photographs  to  get  some  sense  of  what  is  happening  in  the  heart  of   Jerusalem.""   The  behaviour  of  the  government  in  this  instance  is  as  inexplicable  as  it  is  inexcusable.  Sharon,  Landau  and  Livnat  were  all  at  the  forefront  of  demanding  that  the  Barak  Govern   ment  not  allow  one  of  the  most  sen  sitive  archaeological  sites  in  the  world  —  certainly  to  the  Jewish  peo  ple  —  to  be  exempt  from  the  super  vision  to  which  almost  any  road  or  construction  project  is  routinely  subjected,  as  required  by  law.  The  police  are  not  in  a  position,  nor  do  they  have  the  expertise,  to  do  this  themselves.  Furthermore,  the  police  have,  by  consistently  minimising  what  the  Wakf  has  done,  demon  strated  that  they  have  a  clear  con  flict  of  interests  —  it  is  simplest  for  them  to  let  the  Wakf  go  about  its   business.   It  is  absurd,  even  pathetic,  that  Israel  and  the  world  must  rely  upon   Pivotal:  UzJ  Landau.   smuggled  and  aerial  photographs  to  get  some  sense  of  what  is  happening  in  the  heart  of  Jerusalem,  at  a  site  of  unmatched  historical  and  religious  significance  to  the  Jewish  people.  The  first,  most  urgent  way  to  shed  some  light  on  the  situation  is  to  lift  the  ban  on  press  access  to  the  Tem  ple  Mount.   Perhaps  security  considerations  can  justify  preventing  tourists  and  the  non-Muslim  public  from  visiting  the  Temple  Mount,  though  this,  too,  should  not  be  considered  a  normal  and  acceptable  situation.  But  even  if  such  a  general  prohibition  makes  sense,  it  cannot  justify  the  imposi  tion  of  a  journalistic  blackout  on  the  area.  In  other  areas,  such  as  parts  of  the  Gaza  Strip,  that  have  been  closed  to  Israelis  for  security  reasons,  an  exception  has  been  made  for  jour   nalists.   The  introduction  of  journalists  into  the  Temple  Mount  should  not  be  considered  a  sufficient  form  of  supervision  of  the  area.  The  commit  tee  correctly  demands  that  all  con  struction  and  destruction  on  the   Temple  Mount  be  subject  to  a  detailed,  transparent  approval  process,  and  close  supervision  by  the  Antiquities  Authority.   The  Temple  Mount  has  a  rich  his  tory  stretching  over  thousands  of  years,  and  bears  the  imprint  of  Jew  ish,  Islamic,  and  Christian  civilisa  tions.  If  any  other  country  had  entrusted  the  Temple  Mount  to  Islamic  authorities  —  which  deny  any  non-Muslim  connection  to  the  area  and  have  a  record  of  destroying  non-Muslim  artefacts  in  keeping  with  their  extremist  ideology  —  Israel  and  the  Jewish  people  would  be  up  in  arms.  If,  in  addition,  this  other  country  had  prevented  a  modicum  of  supervision  by  archaeologists  and  the  press,  Israel  would  be  screaming  bloody  murder.

"  Bernard  Freedman   THE  Hamas  Palestinian  terrorist  organisation  and  the  Lebanese  terrorist  group  Hezbollah  are  active  in  Australia  through  local  ethnic  groups,  British  terrorism  expert  Dr  Rohan  Gunaratna  has  warned.   He  warned  also  of  the  presence  in  Australia  of  the  Chechen  Mujahedin  —  a  group  linked  to  terrorist  mastermind  Osama  bin  Laden’s  al~  Qaida  network,  and  said  that  local  support  groups  had  raised  funds  for  Hamas  and  Hezbollah.   “The  centre  of  gravity  of   terrorism  is  shifting  from  the  Mid-East  to  the  Asian  region.”   A  research  fellow  at  the  Centre  for  the  Study  of  Terrorism  at  St  Andrews  University  in  Scotland,  Dr  Gunaratna  was  in  Canberra  last  week  for  briefings  with  defence  and  intelligence  organisations.   Within  hours  of  his  warning,  government  sources  reported  raids  by  Australian  Federal  Police,  state  police  and  Australian  Security  Intelligence  Organisation  agents  on  rural  properties  in  NSW,  where  “men  of  Middle  Eastern  appearance”  were  reported  to  be  in  training  with  automatic  weapons.   No  arrests  were  made,  but  some  of  the  raids  appeared  to  be  the  result  of  rivalry  between  Muslim  factions.  Members  of  an  Islamic  youth  organisation  questioned  during  ASIO  security  raids  claimed  they  had  been  informed  on  by  a  rival  Muslim  group  and  were  victims  of  revenge  tactics  arising  from  a  dispute  over  a  radio  licence.   Two  days  after  Dr  Gunaratna’s  warning,  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  announced  that  Australia  would  support  American  initiatives  to  freeze  the  financial  assets  of  terrorists  and  their  sponsors.   Australia  would  immediately  implement  Banking  (Foreign  Exchange)  Regulations  to  freeze  the   financial  flow  of  terrorists  and  their   sponsors,  and  the  Attorney  General’s  Department  would  help  to  trace  financial  transactions   suspected  of  being  related  to  terrorist  activities  and  assist  the  enforcement  in  Australia  of  US  restraining  or  confiscation  orders.   Dr  Gunaratna  said  Australia  was  becoming  increasing  vulnerable  to  Middle  East  terrorists  because  the  “centre  of  gravity  of  terrorism”  was  shifting  from  the  Mid-East  to  the  Asian  region.   “The  threat  to  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  The  Philippines  has  increased  because  al-Qaida  is  finding  it  more  difficult  to  operate  in  Western  Europe  and  North  America,”  he  said.   Al-Qaida  had  shifted  some  of  its  operations  to  Malayasia,  Indonesia,  The  Philippines  and  Thailand  before  the  September  11  terror  attack  on  New  York  and  Washington.

Legal  authorities  said  a  Sharon  case  would  be  less  severe  than  the  investigation  against  former  prime  minister  Ehud  Barak  for  irregu  larities  in  his  1999  campaign.  An  investigation  into  non-profit  organisations  that  helped  fund  his  campaign  is  in  its  final  stages.  Former  prime  minister  Binyamin  Netanyahu  was  not  investigated  for  the  activities  of  similar  organi  sations,  despite  calls  for  an  inquiry.   The  comptroller  fined  the  Labor  Party  $600,000  for  illegal  corporate  contributions.  Likud  was  fined  $278,000.

"  News!   Stefan  Bialoguski   RABBIS  have  joined  other  Jewish  communal  leaders  in  condemning  the  recent  wave  of  attacks  against  mosques  and  churches  —  but  are  waiting  for  Muslim  and  Christian  leaders  to  condemn  antisemitic  attacks  committed  in  Australia  dur  ing  the  past  year.   The  NSW  Rabbinical  Council  was  due  to  release  a  formal  con  demnation  of  the  attacks  this  week,  past  president  Rabbi  Moshe  Gut  nick  said.  “We  condemn  any  act  of  violence  or  vandalism  against  any  house  of  worship.”   Last  month,  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  executive  director  Dr  Colin  Rubenstein  con  demned  an  arson  attack  on  a  Bris  bane  mosque  as  a  “deplorable  [act]  of  violence  and  bigotry”.   And  Executive  Council  of  Aus  tralian  Jewry  president  Nina  Bassat   described  it  as  “horrific”.   Even  Masada  College  students  sent  a  letter  to  the  Islamic  Council  of  Australia,  condemning  harass   ment  of  Muslims.   In  a  recent  attack  against  the  St  Ephraim  Syrian  Orthodox  Church  hall,  Lidcombe,  vandals  sprayed  graffiti  declaring  “Holy  War,  Jihad”  and  “Kill  Jews  1  by  1”  on  the  walls.   Within  three  days,  Lakemba  Mosque  Sheikh  Tajaddin  El  Hilaly  and  a  group  of  imams  joined  Bish  op  Issam  Darwiche  in  a  tour  of  the  churches  and  mosques  that  have   been  vandalised  since  the  World   Trade  Centre  atrocity.   In  1988  Sheikh  Hilaly  attained  notoriety  for  a  speech  to  350  Mus   Graffiti  on  a  church  hall  In  Lidcombe.   lims  at  the  University  of  Sydney  in  which  he  branded  Jews  as  “the  underlying  cause  of  all  wars”  and  said  Jews  “insult  and  defame  God”,  have  a  “malicious  disposition   towards  all  humankind”  and  “use   sex  and  abominable  acts  of  bug   gery  to  control  the  world”.   This  month,  in  a  statement  released  by  the  Lebanese  Moslem  Association,  he  said:  “Attacks  on  places  of  worship  are  acts  of  terror  and  are  strongly  condemned  by   Islam.”   But  Great  Synagogue  Senior  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  said  Christ  ian  and  Muslim  officialdom  had  ignored  the  plight  of  the  Jewish  community,  which  has  seen  arson  and  shooting  attacks  against  its  buildings,  and  physical  and  verbal   abuse  against  its  members  rise  to  unprecedented  levels  since  the  intifada  erupted  in  Israel  12  months  ago.   In  December,  Rabbi  Apple  appealed  to  the  wider  community  for  moral  support,  saying:  “If  some  one’s  garden  gets  trashed,  a  good  neighbour  goes  in  and  helps  to  make  it  beautiful  again.  If  some  one’s  synagogue  is  attacked,  the  neighbours,  especially  the  church  es,  mosques  and  meeting  places,  should  act  like  good  neighbours.”   Last  week  he  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News:  “On  the  whole,  the  official  Christian  community  ...  has  ignored  the  situation.  That’s  not  to  say  that  individual  Christians  are  not  on-side.  There’s  been  nothing  from  the  Islamic  community.  We  take  it  as  a  matter  of  basic  decency  and  morality  to  condemn  attacks  against  them,  but  they  don’t  seem  to  reciprocate.   “In  the  same  way  I  think  it’s  monstrous  for  a  mosque  to  be  attacked  or  for  a  church  to  be  van  dalized,  I  would  have  thought  they  would  have  had  the  same  feeling  about  synagogues.”   Rabbi  Gutnick:  “While  we’re  pleased  to  hear  that  Sheikh  Hilaly  condemns  violence  against  churches,  we  would  be  very  happy   to  hear  him  and  other  clerics  con  demn  the  physical  violence  that’s  been  perpetrated  against  Jewish  men  and  women  and  against  syna  gogues.  We  hope  that  his  failure  to  mention  synagogues  is  simply  an  oversight.” ",2001-10-26

"  Appeasing  the  Palestinians  at  Israel’s  expense   VIEWPOINT   fto&amp;es-fWBSfrich   IN  defining  its  strategy  for  a  post   September  11  world,  the  United  States  publicly  declared  war  on   international  terrorism.   This  war  involves  not  only  the  destruction  of  al-Qaida  and  similar  networks  around  the  world,  the  elimination  of  their  hideouts,  the  disruption  of  their  operations  and  draining  of  terrorist  finances  —  it  also  entails  removing  all  safe  harbours  provided  by  individual  states  (such  as  Afghanistan),  as  well  as  hunting  down  and  punishing  all   those  who  aid  and  abet  terrorist  actions.   Building  an  international  consensus  is  an  important  feature  of  this  American  strategy.  But  it  will  come  at  a  price  not  worth  paying  if   —  as  is  now  the  case  with  the  Muslim  and  Arab  coalition  —  it   involves  wishful  thinking  and  policies  which  are  not  merely  hypocritical  but  self-defeating.   The  most  striking  example  of  the  double  standard  currently  afflicting  American  policy  is  the  official  attitude  adopted  towards  its  two  most  important  strategic  allies  in  the  Middle  East  —  Saudi  Arabia  and  Israel.   Saudi  Arabia  has  refused  America  the  use  of  its  military  bases,  despite  its  dependence  on  the  United  States  for  survival  against  Iraqi  President  Saddam  Hussein  and  other  potential  predators.  Yet  there  has  been  no  public  criticism  from  the  American  Government  of  this  slap  in  the  face.   This  silence  is  all  the  more   remarkable  since  Saudi  complicity  in  the  worst  terrorist  outrage  in  history  is  considerable.  But  for  official  America  (though  not  for  its  media)  this  remains  a  taboo  subject.   The  complicity  goes  far  beyond  the  fact  that  Osama  bin  Laden  is  a  Saudi,  as  were  12  of  the  19  hijackers  in  the  mass  murder  of  September  11;  or  that  as  many  as  10,000  dissident  Saudis  probably  passed  through  bin  Laden’s  Afghan  camps  in  the  past  decade;  or  that  elements  connected  with  bin  Laden  retained   close  ties  with  Saudi  intelligence  right  until  the  New  York  massacre.   After  all,  it  was  Saudi  money  that  helped  establish  the  Taliban  regime,  along  with  help  from  the  Pakistani  intelligence  services  and  without  any  significant  opposition  from   America.   Moreover,  the  fanatically  puritanical  ideology  of  the  Taliban  and  of  bin  Laden  himself  is  an  exported  version  (albeit  more  radical)  of  the  Wahhabite  fundamentalist  Islam  nurtured  in  Saudi  Arabia.   In  the  1990s  the  main  enemy  was  Soviet  Communism,  but  since  its  defeat  in  Afghanistan,  the  anti  Western  and  anti-Christian  elements  of  this  ideology  have  come  into  the   foreground.  Yet  the  American  Government  remains  silent  about  the  fact  that  its  “strategic  ally”,  Saudi  Arabia,  has  been  a  prime  breeding-ground  and  financial  supporter  of  an  ideology  whose  ultimate  aim  is  a  worldwide  jihad  against  the  West!   Hatred  of  America,  Israel  and  Western  secular  modernity  are  an  integral  part  of  this  totalitarian   mindset.   “Nothing  is  more  likely  to  confirm  the  bin  Ladens  in  their  belief  that  terror  can   induce  the  West  to  abandon   the  only  democracy  in  the   Middle  East.”   Saudi  money  has  also  helped  bankroll  the  Hamas  and  other  terrorist  organisations  that  have  disrupted  the  now-defunct  “peace  process”  between  Israel  and  the  Palestinians.  Like  other  Arab  governments,  fearful  of  their  grip  on  power,  the  Saudis  have  encouraged  fundamentalist  terror  and  rabid  antisemitic  conspiracy  theories  that  fuel  hatred  of  the  Israeli  “enemy”.   This  is  no  doubt  an  easy  way  of  diverting  mass  anger  from  threatening  their  own  increasingly  corrupt  rule.  But  this  fundamentalist  ideology  of  hatred  is   a  Frankenstein’s  monster  that  may  yet  turn  against  its  creators,  as  it  has  already  turned  against  America.   Western  policy  has  been  amazingly  blind  in  its  response  to  the  complicity  of  Arab  regimes  in  fundamentalist  Islam  and  in  grasping  the  link  between  Muslim  Judeophobia  and  hatred  of  the  West.  Everything  has  been  reduced  to  a  single,  simplistic  equation  of  “Israeli  occupation”  of  the   territories  with  Muslim  terror  —   though  this  factor  barely  featured  in  bin  Laden’s  own  motivations.   Palestine  is  only  one  link  in  a  much  bigger  chain,  and  the  threat  would  exist  with  or  without  a  Palestinian  state.  For  the  current  Islamic  war  against  Israel  and  World  Jewry  is  both  a  prelude  to,  and  major  weapon  in,  the  much  wider  jihad  of  radical  Islam  against  Western  democracy  perse.   In  many  ways,  the  Judeophobe  aspect  of  this  Islamic  “crusade”  is  analogous  to  Nazi  antisemitic  propaganda  in  the  1930s.  Then,  as  now,  its  implications  were  downplayed  by  appeasers  in  the  West  (and  sometimes  even  by  Jews  themselves)  in  the  vain  hope  that  Hitler’s  ambitions  could  be  moderated.   On  the  big  issues,  President  George  W  Bush  is  no  appeaser.  However,  the  truth  must  be  bluntly  stated.  Appeasing  the  Palestinians  and  Arab  states  at  Israel’s  expense  will  not  help  the  West  in  fighting   international  terror.  On  the  contrary,  nothing  would  bolster  the  Islamic  radicals  more  than  pressure   on  Israel  to  cave  into  demands  that  would  threaten  its  security  and   existence.   This  would  be  the  ultimate  demonstration  of  the  lack  of  backbone  in  the  Western  democracies  and  their  willingness   to  retreat  in  the  face  of  moral  blackmail  and  intimidation.   The  current  American  “ultimatum”  to  Israel  is  the  worst  possible  signal  that  it  could  send  to  its  own  enemies  at  present.  Nothing  is  more  likely  to  confirm  the  bin  Ladens  in  their  belief  that  extremism  pays  and  that  terror  can  ultimately  induce  the  West  to  abandon  and  betray  the  only  democracy  in  the  Middle  East  for  short-term,  illusory  goals.   Israel  is  a  sovereign  state  with  its  own  vital  national  interests  and  a  duty  to  protect  its  citizens.  Jewish  blood  is  no  less  precious  than  that  of  anyone  else,  including  Americans.  There  can  be  no  place  for  diktats  in  American-Israeli  relations,  least  of  all  for  a  coalition  as  evanescent  as  the  Arabian  sands,  which  will  surely  collapse  at  the  first  major  crisis.

"  BUSH  PLEA  TO  CHINA:   'Please  don't  embarrass  me  in  front  of  dad'   WASHINGTON,  Thursday:  US  President  George  W.

""I  am  troubled  by  the  lack  of  timely  Chinese  response  to  our  request  for  access,""  said  Bush.  The  President  urged  both  sides  to  adopt  a  ""measured""  response  to  the  crisis,  in  the  interests  of   keeping  longer-term  relationships  between  the  two  countries  on  track.  ""Besides,""  he  added,  in  a  hoarse  whisper  behind  a  cupped  hand,  ""my  Dad  is  watching,  C'mon  guys  ...  please  let  us  see  them?  Please?""  Gulf  War  Veteran  Hero  Man  Colin  Powell  has  chastised  the  Chinese  for  their  failure  to  understand  the  geo-political  consequences  of  their  actions.

""Besides,  everyone  knows  that  you  don't  make  someone  cry  in  front  of  their  Dad.""  The  Bush  administration  is  keen  to  use  the  China  issue  to  prove  their  foreign  policy  competency.  ""We  must  be  strong  if  we  are  to  see  an  end  to  this  Muslim  conspiracy,""  said  the  confident  President.

"  International   US  Red  Cross  head  quits  over  Israel’s  exclusion   Sharon  Samber   WASHINGTON  —  The  head  of  the  American  Red  Cross  has  resigned  —  and  Israel’s  exclusion  from  the  worldwide  Red  Cross  organisation  appears  to  have  been  the  key  factor.   Dr  Bemadine  Healy  said  she  was  forced  out  of  her  job  over  differ   ences  with  her  board.   In  particular,  she  noted  her  unpopular  decision  to  withhold  American  Red  Cross  dues  from  the  International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  in  protest  at  the  latter’s  refusal  to  accord  full  membership  to  Magen  David  Adorn  —  the  Israeli  relief  agency.   Dr  Healy  took  what  she  termed  a  “controversial  but  principled  stand”  in  supporting  Israel’s  demand  for  membership  of  the  international  organisation.  Magen  David  Adorn  has  observer  status  only.   The  American  Red  Cross  has  withheld  two  years  of  dues  —  $20m  —  as  well  as  voluntary  contrib  utions  from  the  international  body.   Magen  David  Adorn  has  been  barred  from  the  Red  Cross,  which  allows  only  the  red  cross  as  a  logo  and,  in  Muslim  countries,  the  red  crescent.  Israel  insists  on  retaining   its  red  Star  of  David.   Israel’s  exclusion  has  been  a  longstanding  point  of  contention  between  the  American  Red  Cross  and  the  international  body.   The  exclusion  is  attributed  to  lobbying  against  Israel  by  Arab  and   Muslim  members  of  the  International  Red  Cross.  The  official  reason  is  that  allowing  the  Star  of  David  may  encourage  other  groups   to  seek  inclusion  of  their  emblems.   Dr  Healy  said  “reasonable  people  have  differed  with  me,  but  this  is  an  area  of  deep  principle  for  me,  not  easily  compromised”.   Last  month  the  board  tried  to  reverse  course  and  pay  its  dues  to   the  international  body.  Dr  Healy   refused  to  back  down.   The  following  day,  however,  the  American  Red  Cross  voted  to  retain  its  current  policy,  affirming  its  commitment  to  Magen  David  Adom’s  struggle.  “It  is  one  of  our  top  international  policy  priorities,”  said  spokesperson  Leslie  VanSant.   It  remains  to  be  seen  how  aggressively  the  American  Red  Cross  will  pursue  the  issue.  Dr  Healy’s  resignation  may  solidify  American  Red  Cross  support  for  Magen  David  Adorn,  but  doubts  remain  about  the  Israeli  group’s  prospects  of  joining  the  world  body.   American  Red  Cross  officials  announced  that  Harold  Decker  had  been  appointed  interim  CEO.  According  to  the  organisation,  he  supports  full  membership  for  Magen  David  Adorn,  and  agrees  that  dues  should  be  withheld  until  the  Israeli  group  is  admitted.   When  she  began  her  tenure,  Dr  Healy  said  the  Star  of  David  emblem  should  be  recognised  by  the  International  Red  Cross.  The   Dr  Bemadlne  Healy...  ""dared  to  try  to  right  a  wrong  —  the  wrong  of  denying  a   sovereign  nation  equality  because  of  Its  ethnicity”.  Photo:  JTA   exclusion  of  the  Israelis  is  “a  betrayal  of  the  sacred  principles  of  this  movement”  and  “cannot  be  tolerated  any  longer”,  she  said.   Lawrence  Eagleburger,  a  former  US  secretary  of  state,  said  Dr  Healy  had  asked  his  advice  in  forcing  the  International  Federation  of  the  Red  Cross  and  the  Red  Crescent  to  change  policy  towards  Israel.   In  an  op-ed  in  the  Washington  Post,  he  wrote  that  Dr  Healy  had  been  forced  out  of  office  because  “she  dared  to  try  to  right  a  wrong  —  the  wrong  of  denying  a  sovereign  nation  equality  because  of  its  ethnicity”.   Magen  David  Adorn  general  director  Avi  Zohar  credited  Dr  Healy  with  “opening  the  door”  on  the  issue  and  generating  support  in  the  last  two  years.   US  congressional  support  for  Magen  David  Adorn  to  be  included  in  the  International  Red  Cross  reached  a  high  point  this  year,  with  53  senators  signing  letters  in  August  to  Secretary  of  State  Colin  Powell  and  Red  Cross  officials,  urging  the  organisation  to  accept  it.   Representatives  from  Israel  and  the  American  Red  Cross  are  discussing  proposals  to  incorporate  Magen  David  Adom’s  red  Star  of  David  in  a  neutral  emblem.   The  issue  has  blocked  Magen  David  Adom’s  admission  to  the  International  Red  Cross  since  1949.  It  has  met  all  the  other  criteria   required  to  join  the  body.

"  Irving  Wallach   David  Bltel   Yalr  Miller   Hairy  Oppermann   David  Knoll   Sophie  Caplan   Alan  Gold   Robust  debate  on  refugees  ends  in  compromise   AT  THE  BOARD   Stefan   Bialogusld   A  WATERED-DOWN  statement  in  support  of  a  “humane  refugee  admission  program”  has  been  passed  by  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  after  a  robust  debate  in  which  some  members  expressed  fears  of  potentially  hostile  Arab  and  Muslim  communities  in  Australia.   Walter  Dohan  argued  against  Iraqi  and  Palestinian  refugees  being   admitted  into  Australia.   “We  may  as  well  cut  our  own  throats  before  they  do  it  for  us,”  he  said.  “This  motion  should  never  have  been  put  because  we’re  suffering  enough  from  antisemitism  without  it  being  imported.”   His  argument  had  significant  support;  but  it  was  the  human  itarian  cause  —  its  proponents  basing  their  arguments  on  international  law,  recent  Jewish  history  and  Jewish  ethics  —  that  won  the  day  on  a  show  of  hands.   Sydney  Jewish  Museum  president  John  Roth,  whose  concern  that  the  original  motion  was  too  critical  of  the  government  led  to  its  deferral,  moved  the  amended  motion.   The  accepted  motion  calls  for  an  end  to  non-reviewable  mandatory  detention,  the  temporary  protection  visa  system  and  the  “application  of  dehumanising  labels  to  asylum  seekers  and  refugees  and  inappropriate  discrimination  against  onshore  asylum-seekers”.   It  also  calls  on  the  government  “not  to  be  tempted  by  present   exigencies  to  veer  from  Australia’s  legal  and  moral  obligations  with  respect  to  refugees”.   But  the  tone  was  softened,  opening  with  an  affirmation  of  the  government’s  right  to  “maintain  its  own  immigration  policy  and  to  screen  all  potential  immigrants”.  It  also  removes  mention  of  Imm  igration  Minister  Philip  Ruddock.   Said  Board  vice-president  David  Knoll,  who  seconded  the  motion:  “This  is  a  statement  to  the  govern  ment  that  we  believe  that  anybody  who  claims  to  be  a  refugee  has  a  right  not  to  be  turned  away  without  that  claim  being  heard.  They  must  not  be  subjected  to  imprisonment  of   a  standard  no  better  than  that  afforded  to  criminals.”   Mr  Dohan  complained  that  the  motion  was  an  example  of  how  the  Board  had  become  a  pressure  group  for  “all  and  sundry”,  rather  than  looking  out  for  the  Jewish  community.  “We’re  bombarded  with  high-sounding  motions  which  have  nothing  to  do  with  us.”   However,  Education  Committee  chairman  Chaim  Oppermann  countered  that  the  motion  had   everything  to  do  with  Jews,  quoting  the  Torah’s  commandment  to  welcome  the  stranger.  “This  motion   is  the  essence  of  Jewish  teaching,  of   our  concern  for  our  fellow  human   beings  ...  The  law  of  shielding  the  alien  from  all  wrong  ...  this  is  from  the  Chumash,  this  is  our  book.”   Sophie  Caplan,  a  Holocaust  survivor  whose  family  was  denied  refuge  in  Australia  before  the  war,  said:  “It’s  a  fallacy  that  there’s  an  equivalence  between  the  treatment  of  Jews  in  the  1930s  and  what’s  happening  to  these  Muslim  so-called  refugees.  The  Jews  had  no  country  to  take  them,  and  the  White  Paper  barred  entry  to  Mandated  Palestine.   “To  ignore  this  issue  because   it’s  not  our  issue  cuts   contrary  to  everything  I  was   taught  being  Jewish  is  about.”   “These  people  are  Muslims,  and  we  keep  hearing  that  all  Muslims  are  brothers.  There  are  about  30  [Muslim]  countries,  including  wealthy  ones  such  as  Qatar,  Kuwait  and  Saudi  Arabia,  where  these  people  could  go.”   Anti-Defamation  Commission  executive  director  Alan  Gold  noted  that  the  asylum-seekers  were  from  “repressive  regimes”;  and  the  Indo  Chinese  boatpeople  of  a  decade  ago  were  now  a  valuable  part  of  society.   But  he  was  jeered  when  he  tried   to  reassure  those  scared  of  increased  antisemitism  by  saying  that  there  were  laws  to  protect  Jewish  and  other  ethnic  minorities.   Opposing  the  motion,  Otto   Waldman  said  “it  would  be  irresponsible  for  any  Jew  to  forget  that  only  a  few  months  ago  the  flags  of  Israel  and  the  US  were  burned  in  Sydney  by  people  of  Middle  East  appearance.  The  speeches  they  made  were  so  against  Israel  that  I  was  terrified  of  being  attacked.”   But  Social  Justice  Committee  chairman  David  Bitel  said  his  support  for  the  motion  was  a  product  of  his  concern  for  Jews  and   Israel.  “The  solution  to  antisemitism   and  to  Israel’s  problems  is  not  in  disengagement,  but  in  engagement,   conciliation  and  connection.”   Not  only  were  the  refugees  not  solely  of  Middle  Eastern  origin,  but  the  motion  was  not  seeking  to  allow  terrorists  into  Australia,  he  said.   “The  law  says  that  someone  who  comes  with  a  history  of  violence  is  excluded  from  protection,  and  people  without  papers  are  not  protected.  If  people  have  abused  the  system,  their  status  is  cancelled  —  no-one  disagrees  with  that.”   The  NSW  State  Zionist  Council  called  for  the  debate  to  be  deferred  “to  a  more  appropriate  time”,  given  the  international  climate  and  the  onset  of  a  federal  election.   SZC  president  Brian  Levitan  called  on  the  Board  to  focus  on   protecting  the  interests  of  the  Jewish  community,  such  as  why  no  “serious”  Islamic  leaders  had  spoken  against  attacking  Jews,  and  calling  on  the  Premier  to  step  down  as  patron  of  the  NSW  Parliamentary   Friends  of  Palestine.   Irving  Wallach,  whose  parents  were  refugees,  rebutted  the  argu  ment  that  letting  in  the  boatpeople  would  import  antisemitism.   “To  my  great  shame,  the  last  people  who  made  such  a  claim  were  not  protesting  about  Muslims  or  people  without  papers,  they  were  protesting  about  ‘bloody  Jews’  coming  here.  When  I  hear  that  said  in  repelling  refugees  from  our  borders,  it  gives  me  great  shame.”   The  motion  did  not  preclude  the  Board  pursuing  other  matters,  he   added.   Jewish  Secular  Humanist  Society  president  Ian  Bersten’s  claim  that  the  boatpeople  —  unlike  Jewish  refugees  —  were  not  intent  on  being  “productive  citizens  who  fit  into  the  community”  was  greeted  with  jeers.   Board  secretary  Yair  Miller:  “We  have  a  duty  to  be  a  light  unto  the  nations.  That  anybody  can  say  we  should  do  as  was  done  to  us  is  beyond  ridiculous.  To  ignore  this  issue  because  it’s  not  our  issue  cuts  contrary  to  everything  I  was  taught  being  Jewish  is  about.   “Those  who  forget  the  past  are  condemned  to  repeat  it;  woe  be  it  that  we  should  repeat  it.” ",2001-10-26

"  I  REFER  to  the  article  “Telling  it  like  it  is”  (AJN17/8/01)  and  express  my  dis  may  at  Dr  Ruth  Firer’s  statement  that  she  felt  insulted  to  be  manipulated  by  Zionist  ideology,  especially  in  a  democracy.   Dr  Firer  must  be  unaware  that  Israel  was  populated  by  Jewish  set  tlers  long  before  its  independence,  and  in  the  1948  war  the  inhabitants  of  Muslim  villages  fled  to  neighbouring  countries  with  the  certainty  of  com  ing  back  with  the  victorious  invaders.   She  mentions  that  the  Palestinians  have  been  mistreated  by  Israel  and  must  be  compensated.  What  about  the  one  million  Jews  who  lived  in  the  Middle  East  for  centuries?   I  lived  in  Egypt,  and  some  of  my  relations  were  thrown  in  jail  and  tor  tured  for  being  Jews.  Others  lost  their  jobs,  and  their  belongings  were  con  fiscated.  My  mother,  an  old  sick  woman,  left  with  25  Egyptian  pounds.   The  ordeal  of  the  Middle  East  Jews  under  Arab  nationalism  is  hardly  mentioned  in  the  media.  What  about  compensation  for  those  who  left  everything?   Dr  Firer  says  Israel  does  not  pro  vide  education  for  the  Palestinians.  The  Israeli  universities  have  many  Palestinian  students  on  scholarships.  Why  are  there  so  many  Palestinian  children  in  the  frontline?   While  we  pray  for  better  relations  with  Palestinians,  one  would  tend  to  believe  Dr  Firer  is  a  Palestinian  advo  cate.   Dr  F  McDowell  Rose  Bay,  NSW ",2001-09-28
"  A  lone  worshipper  aft  the  Western  Wall.   Photo:  Isranet   Falling  stone  heightens  fear  of  Wall  collapse   JERUSALEM  —  A  fist-sized  stone  that  tumbled  down  the  Western  Wall  at  8am  on  Friday,  causing  light  injury  to  a  man  below,  frightened  Jewish  worshippers  who  thought  Palestinians  were  once  again  pelt  ing  visitors  to  the  Wall.   But  the  Palestinians  gathering  for  Muslim  prayers  atop  the  Temple  Mount  were  only  indirectly  responsible  for  the  stone’s  fall.   Since  June,  senior  archaeologists  have  warned  that  part  of  the  2000  year-old  southern  wall  is  in  danger   of  collapse,  likely  due  to  past  Islamic  Wakf  work  on  Solomon’s  Stables  located  just  above.   An  ominous  10-metre-wide  bulge  is  clearly  visible  on  the  southern  side  of  the  Wall.   Israel’s  Antiquities  Authority  has  been  quiet  both  about  the  protru  sion,  and  tests  it  has  taken  at  the  site,  due  to  the  political  sensitivi   ties  of  the  area.   But  informed  sources  say  engi  neers  have  found  that  sections  of  the  southern  wall  are  in  an  “inter   mediate”  danger  of  collapse.   The  Antiquities  Authority’s  report  on  the  tests  they  conducted  is  due  to  be  made  public  this   month.   A  Magen  David  Adorn  spokesman  added  to  the  worship  pers’  alarm  by  sending  out  a  false  pager  message  to  police  reporters  that  the  Wall  plaza  was  being  stoned.

"  Candles  of  hope  burn  hopelessly   Jackie  Port  paints  a   grim  picture  of  a  New  York  reeling  from   terror  attacks.   THE  city  is  reeling.  Waves  of   trauma  continue  to  reverber   ate,  filling  the  air  with  a  heavi  ness  that  is  impossible  to  escape.  A  shroud  of  insecurity  hangs  over  businesses,  schools,  streets.  A  nor  mally  bustling  city  centre  is   reserved.   The  mood  is  one  of  subdued  sad   ness.  Contained  anger.  Midtown  and  uptown,  there  is  no  visible  sign  of  the  damage,  nothing  except  newspa  pers  on  newsstands  to  reveal  the  scale  of  destruction  inflicted  on  this  small  island.   In  these  fortunate  areas,  there  are  no  blatant  signs  of  the  scars  of  an  attack.  But  there  are  cracks  in  the  composed  atmosphere.  A  strong  police  presence,  the  American  flag  flying  from  apartment  windows  and  store  fronts,  and  the  wet  and  wor  ried  eyes  of  commuters  on  subways  are  small  digestible  symbols  of  an  event  too  heartbreaking  to  compre  hend.   Most  upsetting  are  the  photo  graphs  of  missing  people  painstak  ingly  oosted  around  pillars  and  on   walls,  in  elevators  and  public  phone  booths.  Details  outline  what  loved  ones  were  wearing,  where  they  were  sitting,  the  jobs  they  were  doing  in  the  World  Trade  Centre  at  the  time  of  the  attack.  Placed  at  the  base  of  the  trees  that  dot  our  streets,  can  dles  of  hope  burn  hopelessly  against  a  summer  breeze  set  on  snuffing   them  out.   There  is  no  hysteria,  no  chaos,  no  mob  riots.  The  real  damage  is  invisi  ble.  A  skyline  void  of  the  twin  towers  is  an  eerie  symbol  of  the  frustrating  intangibility  of  the  situation.  The  pain  comes  not  from  what  we  have  to  deal  with,  but  from  what  we  don’t  have.  All  that  is  missing.  Despite  wide  talk  of  a  public  show  of  strength  in  the  face  of  terrorism,  for  the  time  being  we  are  diminished  by  this  great  loss.  There  is  less  hope,  less  happiness  and  a  pile  of  rubble  and  ghosts  where  once  a  thriving  community  of  people  worked  and  lived.   The  students  at  my  school  are  angry.  “We  should  bomb  them  20  times  worse  than  they  hurt  us,”  writes  one  girl.  Teachers  preach  love.  “Don’t  abuse  the  Arabs  at  your  corner  store,”  we  tell  them.  “Our  society  should  be  better  than  that.”   On  my  way  to  work,  I  notice  the  Arabic  stall  holder  I  buy  my  coffee  from  has  placed  a  small  flag  at  his  counter.  Yet  while  Americans  mourn   together,  the  Muslim  community  is  feeling  isolated.  This  is  not  helped  by  the  attitude  expressed  by  such   beacons  of  democracy  as  a  New  York  Arab  newspaper  editor  I  saw  interviewed  on  CNN.  “The  Arab   world,”  he  announced,  “now  hopes   that  the  American  double  standard  and  dominance  in  the  Middle  East  will  be  replaced  with  a  more  fair  sys  tem”.  He  added  that  it  is  now  the  time  for  the  US  to  address  the  “Pales  tinian  struggle”  in  Israel.   This  editor  and  the  people  he  rep  resents  see  this  event  as  a  platform  of  publicity  on  which  to  display  new  demands.  They  sit  at  a  broken  and  splintered  negotiating  table  banging  their  hardline  fists.  There  is  no  com  passion.  Only  a  deep-seated  satisfac  tion  that  Americans  finally  got  their  due.  The  terrorists  and  their  sup  porters  are  a  people  whose  moral  and  ethical  code  is  based  on  one  dimensional  arguments  and  merci  less  vengeance.  They  remind  me  of  a  giant  child  in  a  sandpit,  throwing  sand  in  the  faces  of  all  around  him.   As  a  teacher  and  a  reasonable  human  being  my  job  is  to  teach  my  students  to  reject  hatred  and  indis  criminate  acts  of  prejudice.  But  in  my  heart,  I  view  the  fundamentalist  Muslim  world  with  suspicion.  A  sea  of  strangers  separated  from  me  by  dress  and  culture.

The  claim  appears  to  have  its  roots  in  a  Saudi  Arabian  fundraiser  which  provided  money  for  a  children’s  hos  pital  in  Gaza.   The  email,  which  prompted  con  cern  among  members  of  the  Australian  Jewish  community,  claimed  that  30  cents  of  every  dollar  from  60  branches  in  Saudi  Arabia  would  be  donated  to  the  so-called  A1   Aqsa  Intifada,  which  has  claimed  400  lives  in  the  past  four  months.  It  called  on  readers  to  boycott  McDonald’s  stores  and  to  circulate  the  message.   A  statement  by  McDonald’s  Australia  public  affairs  coordinator  Julie  Clayton  said  that  during  the  Muslim  holy  month  of  Ramadan,  its  Saudi  Arabian  licensees  conducted  a  fundraiser  to  benefit  the  Red  Crescent  Society  and  a  children’s  hospital  in  Gaza.  “This  fundraising  effort  was  part  of  an  ongoing  commitment  by  our  independent  Saudi  partners  to  raise  money  for  organisations  that  support   worthy  children’s  causes,”  it  said.   The  promotion  donated  one  Saudi  riyal  (about  54  cents)  from  every  “Value  Meal”  sold  during  Ramadan.   “McDonald’s’  international  head  office  informed  McDonald’s  Israel  and  our  Israeli  partner,  who  understood  their  effort,”  the  statement  added.

"  News   Attack  on  US:  the   Australian  connection   Stefan  BiaBogUski   AUSTRALIAN  security  services  warned  Jewish  communal  leaders  of  the  likelihood  of  a  major  terrorist  strike  more  than  three  weeks  before  the  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Cen  tre  and  Pentagon.   And  the  Australian  Jewish  News  has  learned  that  increased  vigilance  before  last  year’s  Sydney  Olympic  Games,  together  with  greater  co  operation  between  ASIO  and  other  security  agencies  such  as  Israel’s  Mossad,  led  to  the  opening  of  dossiers  on  “a  number  of  people”.   Sources  say  that  people  in  Syd  ney  with  Islamist  terrorist  links  are  routinely  being  monitored  by  law  enforcement  agencies.   The  Weekend  Australian  reported  that  telephones  linked  to  the  Islamist  group  which  bombed  the  World  Trade  Centre  in  1993  were  regularly  used  to  call  Australian  homes  suspected  of  being  terrorist   “safe  havens”.   Many  of  the  calls  were  reportedly  made  from  the  New  Jersey  apart  ment  of  Ibrahim  Ei-Gabrowny,  who  was  jailed  for  plotting  the  attack  which  killed  six  people  and  injured  1000  in  the  bombing  of  the  World  Trade  Centre  eight  years  ago.   “Some  senior  police  believe  the  calls  are  proof  terrorist  networks  establish  safe  houses  in  countries  such  as  Australia  to  allow  agents  to  lay  low  between  missions,”  the  newspaper  reported.   Sources  say  that  while  The  Week  end  Australian's  story  is  speculative,  it  is  well-founded  and  “extremely  worrying”.  They  said  Australia’s  leading  role  in  standing  up  against  antisemitism  at  the  UN  World  Con  ference  Against  Racism,  in  Durban,  may  have  raised  this  country’s  pro  file  as  a  possible  target  for  terrorists.   The  community  has  been  on  a  high  security  footing  for  several  months,  but  even  greater  measures  have  been  taken  in  recent  weeks  because  of  intelligence  reports  of  a  major  attack.  The  reports  were  unable  to  say  where  in  the  world  the  attack  would  take  place,  but  in  retro  spect  seemed  to  point  towards  last  week’s  events  in  the  United  States.   Sydney’s  Communal  Security  Group  (CSG)  is  expected  to  follow  the  path  of  its  equivalents  in  Mel  bourne  and  South  Africa  by  “going  professional”.  The  appointment  of  a  full-time  head  of  security  could  be   seen  within  three  months.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman  said  of  the  report  in  The  Weekend  Aus   tralian:  “This  is  one  reason  of  a  num  ber  as  to  why,  from  time  to  time,  the  community  goes  on  security  alert.”   However,  he  urged  the  communi  ty  to  maintain  a  sense  of  proportion  about  the  risks  it  faces.   “There’s  been  a  level  of  panic,  which  is  inappropriate  and  unhelp  ful.  While  it’s  good  for  people  to  be  concerned,  people  should  not  over  estimate  the  level  of  risk  within  New   South  Wales.  They  should  simply  be  vigilant  about  ensuring  that  the  CSG  is  involved  in  communal  functions.   “If  there  are  any  persons  who  financially  and  philosophically  sup  port  Middle  Eastern  groups  of  con  cern,  it  would  surprise  me  if  the  law  enforcement  agencies  were  not  mon  itoring  their  activities.”   He  said  that  the  security  risks  in  New  South  Wales  are  no  greater  them  they  were  prior  to  September  11  —  the  date  of  the  attack  on  the  US.   Meanwhile,  author  Mark  Aarons  told  the  AJN  that  the  US  atrocity  rein  forces  the  need  for  stringent  checks  on  boat  people  and  other  would-be  entrants  to  Australia.   Australia’s  role  at  the  World  Conference  Against  Racism  may  have  raised  its  profile  as   a  possible  target.   His  latest  book,  War  Criminals  Welcome,  exposes  the  entry  into  this  country  of  war  criminals  since  1945  —  some  of  them  posing  as  refugees.   He  said  it  could  be  assumed  that  most  of  the  Afghanis  on  the  Tampa,  for  example,  were  trying  to  escape  the  Talibans’  “inhuman  perversion  of  the  Muslim  religion”.   “On  the  other  hand,  Australian  security  would  be  crazy  if  they  didn’t  assume  that  some  people  trying  to  enter  the  country  in  this  way  may  be  enemy  agents.  We  need  rigorous  screening  to  exclude  unsavoury  ele  ments  ...  That  doesn’t  diminish  our  responsibility  to  act  humanely  towards  legitimate  asylum-seekers.”   The  attacks  on  New  York  and  Washington  also  highlighted  the  need  for  tougher  laws  to  deal  with  mass  murderers  who  have  slipped  into  this  country,  he  said.   “Although  people  talk  about  what  happened  in  the  USA  as  war,  it  is  more  a  crime  against  humanity,  in  the  same  way  that  the  killing  of  8000  Muslim  men  in  Srebreniza  by  the  Serbs  was  a  crime  against  humani  ty.” ",2001-09-21
"  TERRORIST  ATTACKS  ON  NEW  YORK  AND  WASHINGTON   The  tragic  events  of  last  month  has  caused  much  grief  to  all  commu-  nities  throughout  the  world.  Sadly,  a  small  section  of  the  community  has  seen  this  as  an  opportunity  to  promote  hatred.   The  attacks  in  the  United  States  have  been  condemned  and  multi-faith  prayer  services  have  been  held  to  mourn  the  victims  and  their  families.  Last  month,  I  directed  the  Community  Relations  Commission  to  set  up  a  24  hour  hotline  to  handle  concerns  from  the  Arabic  speaking  and  Muslim  communities.  To  date,  more  that  300  calls  have  been  lodged  from  people  reporting  racist  incidents  in  the  community.  Some  of  the  reports  received  are  deeply  serious  and  include  verbal  abuse  and  harassment  of  women  of  Islamic  faith.  Some  women  are  too  afraid  to  leave  their  homes  to  shop  for  groceries.  This  is  terrible.  I  urge  anyone  with  information  regarding  such  acts  of  violence  to   come  forward  and  assist  police.  I  say  unequivocally  that  this  type  of  behaviour  has  no  place  in  Australia  -  it  is  un-Australian.  Those  who  feel  they  can  intimidate  our  fellow  citizens,  and  vent  out  their  anger  represent  the  worst  of  humankind  and  should  be  ashamed  of  that  kind  of  behaviour.  At  this  time  there  is  also  an  opportunity  to  show  our  great  humanity,  to  express  a  quality  that  separates  our  home  from  many  others  -  that  is  tolerance.  A  year  ago  Australia  was  seen  as  a  model  of  tolerance.  Let's  continue  to  be  the  most  socially  harmonious  and  diverse  community  in  the  world.

"  Jewish  community  at  peace  rally   THE  Jewish  community  has  been  the  victim  of  numerous  recent  outrages,  a  peace  rally  in   Canberra  was  told.   Representing  the  Canberra  Jewish  commu  nity,  former  community  president  Athol  Morris  referred  to  recent  firebomb  attacks  on  the  National  Jewish  Memorial  Centre  and  called  on  people  to  report  information  about  anyone  committing  or  assisting  in  acts  of  ter   rorism.   The  perpetrators  of  the  recent  US  attacks  were  anti-civilisation,  he  said,  adding  that  there  was  no  justification  for  the  murder  of  civilians,  whether  by  the  Nazis,  in  Rwanda,  Somalia  or  the  Balkans.  “These  acts  were  not  just  uncivilised,”  Mr  Morris  said;  “they  were  the  antithesis  of  civilisation.  They  strike  at  the  very  foundations  of  the  world,  whatever  faith  you  embrace.”   The  aim  of  the  rally  was  to  show  that  Islam,  Christianity  and  Judaism  were  life-affirming  and  civilisation-affirming  faiths.  He  called  on  people  not  to  vent  their  fury  for  these  out   rages  on  innocent  and  uninvolved  people  with  the  same  background  as  the  perpetrators.   Catholic  Bishop  Pat  Power,  who  is  of  Lebanese  and  Irish  background,  urged  Canberrans  not  to  be  part  of  the  backlash  and  not  to  over-react  by  demonising  and  scape  goating  people  in  the  Arab  and  Muslim  com  munity.  He  expressed  concern  at  the  increase  of  racism  in  the  community.   Local  Arab  community  member  Mohammed  Naceur  recounted  his  experience  of  racial  hatred  in  the  wake  of  the  US  attacks,  and  said  Muslims  should  not  be  blamed  for  those  events.   Members  of  the  ACT  Legislative  Assembly  attending  the  rally  included  Chief  Minister  Gary  Humphries,  Attorney-General  Bill  Stefaniak,  Labor  leader  Jon  Stanhope  and  Greens  MLA  Kerrie  Tucker,  who  organised  the  rally.

"  Good,  bad   and  confusing   VIEWPOINT   Gerald  Wolpe   LET’S  see.  I  want  to  make  certain  that  1  have  this  correct.  It  is  very  con  fusing.   If  Israel  pinpoints  and  executes   terrorist  leaders  who  have  aided  in  planning  attacks  on  innocent  civil  ians,  that  is  bad.  If  the  United  States  declares  war  on  terrorist  leaders  who  aided  in  planning  attacks  in  New  York  and  Washington,  that  is  good.   If  Israel  has  to  compromise  some  civilian  rights  of  Arabs  in  order  to  protect  its  citizens  from  murderous  assault,  that  is  bad.  If  the  United  States  must  take  cautionary  steps  that  limit  immigration  and  other  freedoms  in  order  to  protect  its  citi  zens  from  murderous  assault,  that  is  good.   If  Israel  will  not  negotiate  with  ter  rorists  or  their  governmental  sup  porters  until  all  acts  of  terrorism  stop,  that  is  bad.  If  the  United  States  will  not  consider  any  deals  that  do  not  include  the  surrender  of  Osama  bin  Laden  and  his  thugs,  that  is  good.   If  Israel,  with  its  international  iso  lation,  must  work  with  less  than  pure  regimes,  then  that  is  bad.  If  the  Unit  ed  States  works  with  terrorist  spon  sors  as  Iran,  Pakistan  and  Syria  to  win  its  own  security,  then  that  is  good.   If  Israel  tries  to  become  part  of  the  coalition  against  terrorism,  it  is  bad.  (Could  offend  some  Muslim  states).  If  the  United  States  counts  on  Israel,  in  spite  of  the  rejection,  to  provide  it  with  major  information  about  terrorists,  then  that  is  good.   When  Israel’s  civilian  population  was  attacked  by  murderous  scud  missiles  from  Iraq,  it  was  warned  not  to  retaliate  by  the  United  States,  that  would  be  bad.  When  the  United  States’  civilian  population  was  attacked  by  murderous  missiles,  commanded  by  immoral  automa  tons,  and  vowed  massive  retaliation,  that  was  very  very  good.   You  must  admit;  it  is  confusing.   ■  Gerald  Wolpe  is  Rabbi  Emeritus  at  Har  Zion  Temple  Penn  Valley,  Penn  sylvania. ",2001-10-19
"  Danby  defends  ‘Support   Israel’  election  advertisement   Alana  Rosenbaum   AN  adviser  to  Member  for  Melbourne  Ports  Michael  Danby  has  rejected  criticism  of  an   advertisement  in  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  reads  “Support  Israel,  vote  1  Danby”.   Mr  Danby’s  campaign  director,  Ari  Suss,  denied  that  the  advertisement  implied  that  the  Labor  Party’s  policy  on  Israel  was  superior  to  the  Liberals’.  But  he  acknow  ledged  that  it  was  designed  to  provoke  people  to  re-evaluate  their  preferences  on  the  basis  of  Mr  Danby’s  communal  achievements.   In  the  advertisement,  which  appeared  in  the  Melbourne  edition  of  the  AJN,  the  words  “Support  Israel  vote  1  Danby”,  were  super  imposed  on  clippings  citing  Mr  Danby’s   communal  involvement.  It  stated  that  “There  is  one  parliamentarian  who  can  convey  the  connection  between  the  terrorist  attacks  on  the  US  and  the  suicide  bombings  in  Israel”.   The  AJN  has  received  letters  objecting  to  the  implications  of  the  advertisement,  that  supporting  Israel  equates  to  voting  for  Mr  Danby.  Steve  Brook:  “What  effect  might  this  have  in  marginal  electorates  with  a  substantial  Arab  or  Moslem  population?  Given  the  grassroots  feelings  in  these  communities,  it  could  well  result  in  a  loss  of  Labor  seats.”   The  advertisement  prompted  debate  on  Radio  3AW,  presenter  Neil  Mitchell  defending  the  advertisement  after  a  caller  suggested  that   Michael  Danby   it  was  wrong.  He  said  Labor  was  targeting  various  groups  with  its  advertising,  and  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  the  Danby  campaign.   Mr  Suss  said  only  one  letter  protesting  against  the  advertisement  had  reached  the  Melbourne  Ports  office  —  from  a  member  of  the  far-right  Advance  Australia  Party.   He  noted  that  there  were  politicians  representing  the  interests  of  Muslim  electorates  in  Federal  Parliament,  and  that  Mr  Danby  “does  exactly  that”  for  his  Jewish   constituents.

"  Forgotten  by  all  but  God   □  THE  media  has  failed  abjectly  to  cover  the  curious  plight  of  the  two  Australian  Christian  zealots  held  in  Afghanistan.  Diana  Thomas  and  Peter  Bunch  was  arrested  in  August  along  with  four  Germans  and  two   Americans  while  trying  to  flog  evangelical  Christianity  to  a  population  which  is  99.9  per  cent  Muslim.  While  the  war  and  drought-ravaged  Afghans  desperately  need  food  and  technical  assistance,  Thomas,  Bunch  et  al  brought  hundreds  of  Bibles  and  more  than  6,000  tape  casettes.  The  Taliban  was  at  the  point  of  deporting  them  four  weeks  ago  when  their  investigation  took  a  new  turn  and  suddenly  its  was  announced  that  all  the  detainees  would  go  on  trial.  What  did  the  Taliban  uncover?  The  missionaries  belong  to  a  vague  organisation  called  Shelter  Now  but  no  one  in  the  media  has  bothered  to  check  it  out.  Compare  the  media  treatment  of  Thomas  and   Bunch  with  the  hue  and  cry  over  the  cpature  of  CARE  Australia  workers  Steve  Pratt  and  Peter  Wallace  in  1999.  When  they  were  detained  by  the  Yugoslav  authorities  trying  to  flee  to  neighbouring  Hungary  just  after  the  NATO  bombing  started,  the  media  was  saturated  with  coverage  and  high-profile  diplomatic  efforts  by  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  and  Foreign  Minister  Alexander  Downer.  Yet  the  two  Christians  from  Western  Australia,  headquarters  of  the  SAS,  are  fighting  to  get  a  line  in  the  papers  of  a  mention  on  the  news.  Why?  And  finally,  Barfly  is  eagerly  awaiting  a  statement  from  the  head  honchos  of  Shelters  Now  opposing  and  US-led  invasion  of  Afghanistan  or  the  bombing  destruction  of  Kabul.  That  would  be  the  Christian  thing  to  do,  but  will  it  happen?  Will  someone  on  the  news  desk  contact  Shelter  Now  -  wherever  it  is  located  -  and  ask  what's  happening.

"  ONE  of  the  refrains  from  Jewish  leaders  in  recent  months  has  been  that  government  support,  both  state  and  federal,  should  be  forthcoming  to  assist  Jewish  organisations  with  the  costs  of  heightened  security.   Necessitated  by  expressions  of  racist  vio  lence  and  vandalism,  the  additional  secu  rity  measures  have  had  to  be  implemented  because  of  the  unprecedented  spate  of  antisemitic  incidents  in  the  past  year.   No  government  funding  has  been  forth  coming.  Yet  last  week  the  Department  of  Community  Services  (DoCS)  announced  that  it  is  allocating  funds  to  assist  the  Muslim  community  in  coping  with  the  aftermath  of  September  11.   While  all  moves  to  assist  all  communities  in  dealing  with  such  trauma  are  welcome,  there  is  something  amiss  at  what  the  pres  ident  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  has  described  as  “the  apparent  oversight”  in  regard  to  the  needs  of  the  Jewish  com  munity,  which  has  been  the  target  of  a  far   more  serious  incidence  of  attacks  in  recent  months  (page  3).   In  lieu  of  our  feature  this  week,  we  have  reproduced  front  pages  from  the   Australian  Jewish  News  of  2001.

"  Women  launch  interfaith  network   AmaBeiger   “HOW  often  does  opportunity  present  itself,  you  miss  the  moment  and  live  to  regret  it?”   This  was  the  opening  sentence  of  an  address  by  Josie  Lacey  at  the  launch  of  the  Women’s  Interfaith  Network  (WIN)  at  State  Parliament  House  recently.   The  fact  that  WIN  came  into  being  is  a  result  of  an  opportunity  that  Ms  Lacey  didn’t  miss.   In  August  1999,  the  Catholic  Bishops’  Interfaith  Conference  was  held  in  Sydney.  It  was  a  meeting  of  leaders  of  major  religious  groups,  comprising  mostly  men.  A  Muslim  woman  com  mented  that  it  would  be  good  if  women  contin  ued  to  meet;  that  was  when  the  idea  for  WIN  was  bom.   With  the  help  of  Sister  Trish  Madigan,  Ms  Lacey  gathered  a  small  number  of  key  women  horn  nine  faith  groups  and  presented  the  idea  to  them.  This  was  followed  by  18  months  of  meet  ing,  learning  about  each  other’s  religious  beliefs  and  practices,  and  building  bridges  of  trust  based  on  shared  experiences.  Then  it  was  time  to  open  WIN  to  other  women.  Like  a  pebble  dropped  into  water,  the  ripples  began  to  spread.   The  launch  took  the  form  of  a  presentation  by  representatives  of  eight  faith  groups  —  Aboriginal,  Baha’i,  Buddhist,  Christian,  Hindu,  Muslim,  Quaker,  Zoroastrian  and  Jewish  —  to  an  audience  of  70  women,  with  Dr  Rachael  Kohn,  presenter  of  the  ABC  religion  program  The  Spirit  of  Things  the  moderator.   Fittingly,  Aboriginal  delegate  Elsie  Heiss  opened  proceedings  by  saying:  “We  are  gath  ered  side  by  side  as  women  of  different  faiths  and  cultures.  I  hope  that  in  the  future  we  can  show  religion  need  not  be  another  barrier  between  people.  Rather,  it  will  help  build  greater  tolerance  and  understanding  of  differ  ences  and  the  realisation  that  we  are  all  one.”   The  message  of  inclusiveness  was  echoed  by  all  the  speakers  in  different  ways,  according  to  their  religious,  cultural  and  personal  back   grounds.   T  h  e  Venerable  Christine  Roberts,  a  T  i  b  e  t  a  r  Buddhist  nun  commented:  “I   began  to  realise  that  when  you  think  you  have  an  open  mind  doesn’t  mean  it  is  actually  open.  How  do   The  Jewish  continent,  back  from  left  Anna  Berger,  Peta   Jones  PeDach,  Dr  Rachael  Kohn,   Ninfo,  Cety  Bei&gt;Choam,  SfteBa  Faktor;  Caroline  Haskl.   you  know  wnat  you  aon  t  know  u  we  juage  om  ers  through  our  own  prejudice  and  segrega  tion?”  She  spoke  also  of  the  impact  on  her  of  the  group’s  visit  to  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum,  looking  into  the  dark  side  of  human  nature  and  seeing  what  can  happen  if  we  abandon  love,  compassion  and  mutual  respect.   Sister  Mary  Cresp,  a  Josephite  Catholic  nun,  encapsulated  the  purpose  and  hope  of  WIN:  “We  have  to  celebrate  the  differences  which  make  up  the  garden  of  our  society,  and  in  this  way  find  what  unites  us.”   The  Jewish  delegation  lived  up  to  the  ideal  of  inclusiveness.  Women  representing  our  own  diversity  —  Orthodox,  Reform,  Ashkenazi,  Sephardi,  mothers,  wives,  businesswomen,  young  and  not-so-young—came  together  unit  ed  in  the  hope  and  belief  that  women  can  make  a  difference  and  create  a  better,  calmer  world.   Hopefully,  WIN  will  continue  to  grow,  to  use  the  spiritual  strength,  compassion  and  hope  for  a  better  and  more  peaceful  harmonious  world  of  women  of  faith  in  our  wider  community.

"  Delegitimising  Israel   Michael  Jordan   NEW  YORK  —  The  accusation  that  Ariel  Sharon  is  a  war  criminal  —  back  on  the  agenda  with  two  court  cases  in  Belgium  and  a  damning  BBC  documentary  —  is  the  latest  step  in  a  campaign  to  delegitimise  Israel,  according  to  observers.   The  internet  reveals  a  plethora  of  Arab  and  Muslim  websites  demanding  that  Sharon  be  “brought  to  justice”  for  the  1982  massacre  of  800  Palestinians  by  Lebanese  Christians  in  the  Sabra  and  Shatila  refugee  camps.   However,  Sharon  also  seems  to  be  caught  in  the  cross-hairs  of  advocates  of  an  international  criminal  court  and  a  “universal  justice”  that  knows  no  borders.   While  his  antagonists  may  be  motivated  by  enmity  towards  Israel,  international  court  proponents  seem  intent  primarily  on  winning  symbolic  victories  that  they  hope  might  deter  future  atrocities.   While  Sharon  is  unlikely  to  end  up  in  the  dock,  the  cases  have  focused  hostile  attention  on  Israel  at  a  time  when  it  is  fighting  for  world  opinion  after  nine  months  of  intifada.   The  second  half  of  the  1990s  saw  advances  in  prosecuting  war   crimes.  It  also  emboldened  those  wanting  to  go  after  Uganda’s  Idi  Amin,  Libya’s  Muammar  Gaddhafi,  Iraq’s  Saddam  Hussein  and  the  now  deceased  Pol  Pot  of  Kampuchea  and   Hafez  Assad  of  Syria.   First  came  war  crime  tribunals  to  prosecute  perpetrators  of  genocides  in  Rwanda  and  Bosnia.  Then  came  the  1998  arrest  of  Chile’s  General  Augusto  Pinochet;  a  Spanish  judge   issued  the  warrant  over  human  rights  crimes  against  Pinochet.  Last  month,  Belgian  courts  convicted  four  Rwandans  of  murder  and  incitement  to  genocide.  It  marked  the  first  conviction  under  Belgium’s  ground-breaking  1993  law  on  “universal  jurisdiction”,  which  enables  Belgian  courts  to  judge   atrocities  committed  elsewhere.   “As  soon  as  problems  arose,   the  name  of  the  game  is  delegitimisation  of  Israel.""   No-one  was  prosecuted  for  the  Sabra  and  Shatila  massacres.   In  1983  Israel’s  Kahan  Commission  found  then-Defence  Minister  Sharon  “indirectly  responsible”  because  he  did  not  foresee  the  possibility  that  the  Christians  —  who  had  entered  the  camps  to  find  Palestinian  terrorists  —  would  avenge  the  assassination  of  their  leader,  Bashir  Gemayel.  Sharon  received  a  slap  on  the  wrist;  pressured  to  resign  as  Defence  Minister,  he  remained  in  the  cabinet  as  Minister  Without  Portfolio.   Time  attributed  to  him  a  greater   share  of  blame.  He  sued  for  libel,  and  a  US  court  ruled  that  the  article  was  flawed,  but  lacked  malice.   Now,  in  light  of  the  verdict  against  the  Rwandans,  Belgium  has  emerged  as  a  pressure-point  against  leaders  like  Sharon.  “A  fight  has  to  be  fought  against  impunity,”  said  Michel  Malherbe  of  Belgium’s  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs.   On  June  18,  28  Palestinians  filed  suit  under  the  Belgian  law,  charging  Sharon  with  responsibility  for  the  massacre.  It  followed  a  similar  suit   filed  in  Brussels  by  a  private  group  on  behalf  of  Palestinian  victims  of  the  current  intifada.   In  response,  an  Israeli  Knesset  member  from  Sharon’s  Likud  Party,  Avraham  Herschson,  has  threatened  to  file  suit  in  Brussels  against  Palestinian  Authority  Chairman  Yasser  Arafat  for  alleged   war  crimes  in  the  current  intifada.   “  ‘Universal  jurisdiction’  means  anyone  can  claim  anything  against  anybody,”  said  Alan  Baker,  legal  adviser  to  Israel’s  Foreign  Ministry.   But  Belgium  may  not  be  the  end  of  the  story.  A  lawyer  for  the  Palestinian  victims  said  suits  against  Sharon  will  also  be  filed  in  Britain,  France  and  Denmark.  Some  predict  that  just  as  American  victims  of  Palestinian  terror  and  Bosnian  Muslim  victims  of  Bosnian  Serbs  have  sued  the  perpetrators  in  American  courts,  Palestinians  may  seek  a  court  hearing  in  the  US.   How  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  Is  being  depicted  In  some  quarters.   Perhaps  even  more  influential  in  blackening  Israel’s  image  was  the  BBC’s  broadcast  of  The  Accused,  which  placed  ultimate  blame  for  the  massacres  on  Sharon,  with  Princeton  International  Law   Professor  Richard  Falk  asserting   that  Sharon  is  “indictable”.  Israel  denounced  the  program  as  “unfair,  distorted  and  hostile”  —  with  a  whiff  of  the  BBC’s  “well-known  antisemitism  and  anti-Israel  bias”.   Professor  Falk:  “All  the  evidence  I  saw  would  make  him  indictable  to  those  crimes,  but  not  necessarily  convictable.  That’s  an  important  distinction.  One  of  the  things  that  Nuremberg  made  clear  was  that  a  general  or  political  official  is  responsible  for  military  operations   under  his  command.  That  means  if  he  fails  to  exercise  sufficient  control,  that  person  is  criminally  responsible  for  harm  that  is  done.”   Falk,  who  is  Jewish,  was  a  member  of  a  team  dispatched  in  February  by  the  UN  Commission  on  Human  Rights  to  document  Israel’s  “excessive”  use  of  force  against  Palestinians  —  a  conclusion  which  it  reached  before  the  investigation.   Which  leads  Baker  to  conclude  that  “when  things  were  going  well,  everyone  was  happy  with  Israel.  As  soon  as  problems  arose  and  the  Palestinians  decided  they  didn’t  want  to  negotiate,  we  revert  to  15  years  ago,  when  the  name  of  the  game  is  delegitimisation  of  Israel   ana  its  oasis  tor  existence.

"  Exploding  die  myth  of  Deir  Yassm  I   VIEWPOINT   WHILE  Jews  are  celebrating   Pesach  on  April  7,  Arabs  around  the  world  will  take   part  in  rallies  to  commemorate  the  53rd  anniversary  of  the  Deir  Yassin  myth,  linking  it  with  the  Palestinian  “right  of  return”.   Critics  have  used  Deir  Yassin  to  blacken  Israel’s  image,  alleging  that  Jewish  fighters  massacred  hundreds  of  Arab  civilians  during  a  battle  in  that  Arab  village  near  Jerusalem  in  1948.  The  Arabs  have  used  it  to  demonise  Israel,  to  make  it  seem  as  if  there  is  a  moral  equivalence  between  Arab  ter  rorism  and  Jewish  defence.   In  1948  the  Arabs  declared:  “This  will  be  a  war  of  extermination  and  a  massacre  which  will  be  remembered  for  generations  to  come  ...  like  the  great  slaughters  of  the  Mongols  and  the  Crusaders”.  Each  Arab  village  had  to  decide  what  role  it  was  to  play  in  the  war.  Deir  Yassin  decided  to  join  the  genocidal  intentions  of  the  five  invading  Arab  nations,  while  a  few  Arab  villages,  like  the  nearby  Abu  Ghosh,  decided  not  to  participate.   Deir  Yassin  was  strategically  locat  ed,  overlooking  the  Jerusalem-Tel  Aviv  highway.  Large  numbers  of  Arab  soldiers  —  Iraqis  and  others  —  were  stationed  amidst  the  civilians  in  the  village.  The  Arab  soldiers  repeatedly  shot  at  neighbouring  Jewish  villages  and  attacked  traffic  on  the  Jerusalem  Tel  Aviv  highway,  effectively  cutting  off  western  Jerusalem  from  much  of  the  rest  of  the  country.  In  order  to  halt  such  attacks,  it  became  necessary  to  capture  Deir  Yassin.   There  was  a  combined  operation  of  the  Haganah  and  the  Irgun.  The  sol  diers  were  given  strict  instructions  to  refrain  from  harming  civilians  and  to  warn  them  in  Arabic  to  leave.   The  first  Jewish  fighting  units  to  reach  Deir  Yassin  were  led  by  a  truck  with  a  loudspeaker.  An  Iraqi-born  Jew  who  spoke  fluent  Arabic  called  to  res  idents  to  leave.  The  truck  was  hit  by  gunfire.  By  giving  this  humane  warn  ing,  Jewish  fighters  threw  away  the  element  of  surprise,  thus  increasing   their  own  risk  and  losses.  A  substan  tial  number  of  the  inhabitants  obeyed  the  warning  and  were  unhurt.  The  enemy’s  fire  was  murderous,  to  which  the  number  of  Jewish  casualties,  40  per  cent,  bears  testimony.  The  sub  stantial  quantities  of  weapons  and  ammunition  found  in  Deir  Yassin  pro  vided  additional  confirmation  of  sus  picions  that  the  village  had  been  turn  ing  into  a  heavily-armed  military  post.   At  least  two  witnesses  recalled  hearing  the  repeated  use  of  the  loud  speaker  to  implore  the  residents  to   surrender.  There  were  also  instances  in  which  Arabs  feigned  surrender,  then  produced  hidden  weapons  and  shot  at  their  would-be  captors.  Among  the  Arab  soldiers  killed  was  an  Iraqi  officer  and  a  Yugoslav  Muslim  officer  whose  identification  papers  indicated  that  he  had  been  with  the  Muslim  units  of  the  Nazi  SS  that  had  been  organised  in  Yugoslavia  during  World  War  II  by  Haj  Amin  el-Husseini,  the  Palestinian  Arab  leader  and  Nazi   collaborator.   To  counteract  the  strategic  loss  of  Deir  Yassin,  Arab  headquarters  at  Ramallah  broadcast  an  atrocity  story,   alleging  a  massacre  of  women  and  children.  Certain  Jewish  officials,  fear  ing  the  Irgun  as  political  rivals,  seized  on  this  propaganda  to  smear  the  Irgun.   A  disgruntled  Jewish  soldier  whose  unit  was  disbanded  before  the  attack,  Meir  Pe’il  (who  later  became  a  Communist  Member  of  Knesset),  claimed  that  he  had  witnessed  a  mas  sacre  of  civilians  at  Deir  Yassin.  His  evidence  was  refuted  by  journalist  David  Bedein,  who  found  in  Israel  Defence  Force  archives  a  report   signed  by  Pe’il  showing  that  he  was  not  at  Deir  Yassin  at  the  time  of  the   battle.   In  the  BBC  Television  series  Israel   Jewish  fighters  during  Israel's  War  of  Independence  in  1948.   and  the  Arabs:  The  50  Years,  an  editor  of  the  Palestine  Broadcasting  Service’s  Arabic  news  in  1948  claims  that  he  was  instructed  by  Hussein  Khalidi,  secretary  of  the  Arab  Higher  Committee,  to  exaggerate  abuses,  claiming  that  children  were  murdered  and  pregnant  women  were  raped.  Deir  Yassin  survivor  Abu  Mahmoud  told  the  BBC  that  the  villagers  had  protested  about  being  asked  to  exag  gerate.   A  new  PBS  documentary  has  con  firmed  that  Arab  eyewitnesses  fabri  cated  allegations  that  atrocities  were  committed  at  Deir  Yassin.  The  docu  mentary,  The  50  Years  War.  Israel  and  the  Arabs,  broadcast  on  January  24,  1999,  confirmed  a  number  of  key  points:   H  Deir  Yassin  was  heavily  armed,   ^1  the  Jewish  attackers  warned  the  residents  in  advance,  and  some  left  voluntarily,   H  claims  of  rape  and  other  atrocities  were  fabricated  to  incite  Arab  vio  lence  against  Israel,   H  the  number  of  dead  was  110,  not  254.   Hazem  Nusseibeh  says  in  the  docu   Newspaper  headlines  reporting  the  progress  of  the  war.   mentary,  concerning  the  fabricated  Deir  Yassin  allegations:  “This  was  our  biggest  mistake.  We  did  not  realise  how  our  people  would  react.  As  soon   as  they  heard  that  women  had  been  I  raped  at  Deir  Yassin,  Palestinians  fled   in  terror.  They  ran  away  from  all  our  |  villages.”  i   The  narrator  adds:  “In  the  next  few  I  months,  over  half  the  Arab  popula  tion,  threequarters  of  a  million  peo  ple,  fled  their  homes  in  Palestine”.

"  celebrity  advice   This  issue's  special  guest:  JEREMY  BENTHAM   Dear  Jeremy  Bentham  I  am  a  working  husband  wit  children.  My  wife  doesn't  pay  me  any  attention  any  more.  Ever  since  we  had  children,  she  just  spends  her  time  caring  for  them,  mean-  while  my  needs  go  unattended.  What  should  I  do?   Dear  deprived  salaried  provider  Your  problem  is  not  uncommon,  but  it  will  help  to  understand  it  within  a  rational  framework.  Your  wife's  role  as  a  mother  is  one  of  important  socio-eco-  nomic  utility.  Your  children  are  the  industrialised  labour  force  of  tommor-  row  and  without  the  reproduction  of  labour,  how  can  we  develop  and  progress?  It  is  not  your  emotional  needs  that  are  important,  but  whatever  process  provides  the  most  efficient  bene-  fit  possible  to  society.  Try  not  to  see  your  wife  as  a  lover,  but  as  a  unit  of  repro-  duction.  Her  legitimacy  lies  not  in  the  the  servicing  of  your  needs,  beneficial  as  they  are  to  you,  but  in  the  efficient  gen-  eration  of  the  maximum  reproductive  benefit  possible  from  the  least  amount  of  resources.  Dear  Jeremy,  I  am  an  Aborigine,  and  my  brother  is  in  jail  for  petty  theft.  He  keeps  threatening  to  kill  himself.  What  should  I  do?  I  assume  from  your  racial  description  that  you  are  the  subject  of  expensive  government  welfare  expenditure.  This  is   an  extremely  inefficient  means  of  main-  taining  pools  of  surplus  labour.  Rather  than  public  schools  &amp;  housing,  govern-  ments  both  Liberal  &amp;  Labor  have,  on  a  cost-benefit  analysis,  decided  that  it  is  far  more  efficient  to  keep  blacks  in  prison.  This  process  has  a  dual  utility.  Firstly,  it  is  far  easier  to  justify  massive  expenditure  cuts  to  correctional  services  than  it  is  to  hospitals  &amp;  schools;  and  sec-  ondly,  it  keeps  blacks,  muslim  migrants,  and  poor  white  men  from  unconscious  criminal  attacks  upon  the  logic  and  rationality  of  free-market  mercantilism.  Your  brother  is  doing  us  all  a  service  by  providing  cheap  labour  for  the  private  sector,  and  saving  governments  money.   ABOVE:  Bentham  in  old  age ",2001-05-24
"  News   Powell,  Israel  boycott  world  racism  forum   WASHINGTON  —  Sending  a  strong  signal  to  the  international  community,  US  Secretary  of  State  Colin  Powell  is  boycotting  the  United  Nations  World  Conference  Against  Racism  —  which  begins  in  South  Africa  this  week  —  because  of  its  anti-Israel  atmosphere.   Israel,  the  World  Jewish  Congress  and  the  Jewish  Agency  are  also  boycotting,  while  Canada  is  considering  boycotting  if  anti-Israel  language  is  not  removed  from  a  resolution  to  be  tabled.   US  State  Department  spokesman  Richard  Boucher  said  Powell  would  not  attend  because  resolutions   unfairly  criticise  Israel.  Washington  may  send  observers.  “If  they  use  the  forum  as  a  way  to  isolate  our  friend  and  strong  ally,  we  will  not  participate,”  a  US  spokesman  said.   Jewish  activists  are  resigned  to  Israel  taking  a  rhetorical  beating.  With  one  vote  per  country,  the  Arab-Muslim  bloc  can  dictate  res  olutions.  Among  the  broadsides  expected,  delegates  may:   •  denigrate  Zionism  as  racism;   •  accuse  Israel  of  being  an  apartheid  state;   •  exclude  antisemitism  from  the  various  forms  of  racism;   •  minimise  the  Holocaust  as  one   of  many  instances  of  genocide,  rather  than  a  unique  event;   •  equate  the  suffering  of  Pales  tinians  with  Jews  under  the  Nazis.   US  Secretary  of  State  Colin  Powell.   In  a  meeting  with  Jewish  groups  in  Geneva,  UN  Human  Rights  Commissioner  Mary  Robinson  supported  efforts  to  remove  the  harshest  anti-Israeli  and  antisemitic  language.  However,  Robinson  —  whom  pro-Israel  advocates  have  accused  of  hostility  towards  Israel  —  also  indicated  her  belief  that  the  forum  must  address  Israel’s  treatment  of  Palestinians.   Taking  their  cue  from  the  US,  Israel  and  US  Jewish  groups  also  said  they  would  boycott  or  reduce  their  presence.  Hadassah  —  the  Women’s  Zionist  Organisation  of  America  —  has  sent  a  delegation,  but  is  considering  walking  out.   “The  countries  of  the  world  are  allowing  the  Arabs  to  hijack  the  conference  and  manipulate  the  human  con-dition  to  achieve  political  victories,”  said  Amy  Goldstein  of  Hadassah.  “The  Jewish   people  have  a  lot  to  say  on  racism,  but  they’re  preventing  Jewish  civil  society  from  speaking  out  by  forcing   us  to  defend  our  existence.1   JTA ",2001-08-31
"  Feature   As  he  launched  the  attack  on  Afghanistan,  US  President  George  W  Bush  took  pains  to   emphasise  that  Muslims  were  not  the  enemy.  Larry  Derfner  looks  for  moderate  Islam.   HERE  is  US  President  George  W   Bush  on  Islam:  “Its  teachings  are  good  and  peaceful”  and  “those  who  commit  evil  in  the  name  of  Allah  blaspheme  the  name  of  Allah”.   It’s  hard,  though,  to  understand  Islam  as  a  “good  and  peaceful”  reli  gion  when  its  headline  grabbers  in  this  generation  are  the  likes  of  Osama  bin  Laden,  the  Taliban,  the  late  Ayatollah  Khomeini,  Hamas  and  Islamic  Jihad.   Yet  anybody  who  has  known  Mus  lims  personally,  as  many  Israelis  have,  understands  that  there  are  Muslims  who  are  spiritually  shattered  by  the  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Centre  and  the  Pentagon.  They’re  mortified  that  these  attacks  were  committed  in  the  name  of  their  religion.   Whether  these  lately-stricken  Muslims  account  for  an  overwhelm  ing  majority  of  world  Islam,  or  a  less  than-overwhelming  majority,  or  even  a  substantial  minority,  is  hard  to  say.   But  they  are  legion,  and  they  don’t  make  headlines  because  they  don’t  blow  up  anything,  don’t  take  over  countries,  and,  in  fact,  general  ly  make  a  point  of  keeping  religion  separate  from  politics.   They  might  be  called  “Muslims  without  jihad'  or  “Muslims  against  jihad'.  They  note  that  Mohammed  said  the  highest  form  of  jihad  is  not  holy  war,  but  the  moral  and  spiritual  struggle  within  oneself.   They  are  not,  by  any  means,  all  alike.  Some  are  western-oriented  lib  erals,  some  are  Islamic  fundamental  ists.  Some  try  to  explain  bin  Laden  as  an  aberration  of  Islamic  society,  some  see  him  as  the  ultimate  expres  sion  of  what’s  wrong  with  it.   However,  one  should  not  expect  to  find  pro-Zionists  among  them,  or  supporters  of  the  Israeli  side  in  the   intifada.   Dr  Ali  Qleibo  is  head  of  the  Facul  ty  of  Fine  Arts  at  A1  Quds  University  in  East  Jerusalem.  An  abstract  painter  whose  doctorate  is  in  anthropology,  he  was  raised  in  a  tol  erant  spirit  of  Islam,  and  in  recent  years  has  adopted  Sufism,  an  Islamic  stream  that  he  says  gives  shape  to  the  things  he  always  believed.   On  behalf  of  the  Faculty  of  Fine  Arts,  Dr  Qleibo  wrote  a  letter  to  the  US  Consulate  in  East  Jerusalem  say  ing  the  attack  on  the  World  Trade  Centre  was  “an  attack  on  the  key  symbols  of  free  enterprise  and  democracy,  which  we  consider  the  main  elements  of  humanism”.   Liberal  Muslims,  he  said,  do  not  merely  sympathise  with  American  suffering  from  a  distance,  but  “feel  the  threat  personally.  We  identify  with  this  suffering,  this  is  our  suffer  ing,  our  grief.”   To  Dr  Qleiblo,  Islam  is  “a  religion  of  ease,  of  comfort,  it  exists  to  serve  man.  It  has  an  easygoing  quality,  a  flexibility,  a  certain  amount  of  ration  al  adaptability.”   God,  for  Dr  Qleibo,  is  “love,  com  passion,  mercy”.  His  religiosity  is  not   based  on  rituals.   “Orthodox  believers  think  that  every  little  thing  they  do  is  of  such  importance  to  God,”  he  said  lightly,  adding  that  he  finds  his  spirituality  “between  the  lines”  of  the  religion.   Islam  is  based  on  two  books  —  the  Koran,  taken  as  the  revealed  word  of  God,  and  the  Sira,  which  is  the  life  and  sayings  of  Mohammed.  But  the  meaning  of  the  words  can  and  have  been  interpreted  countless  ways.  Thousands  of  volumes  of   interpretations  of  these  books  have  been  written.   While  his  liberal,  humanist  brand  of  Islam  is  rare  in  Arab  society  today,  Dr  Qleibo  pointed  out  that  it  has  a  long,  very  proud  tradition  going  back  to  medieval  Spain.  Great  Mus  lim  philosophers  such  as  Ibn  Sira,  Ibn  Rushd  and  El-Arabi  interpreted  Islam  in  light  of  their  grounding  in  Greek  philosophy,  and  the  result  was  an  open-minded,  humane  read  ing  of  the  religion,  he  notes.   In  the  1890s  there  was  an  attempt  by  intellectuals  in  the  Arab  world  to  revive  this  old  Islamic  culture;  it  was  called  the  Arab  Renaissance.   “The  idea  was  to  graft  western  liberalism  and  humanism  onto  Islam  ic  culture,”  said  Dr  Qleibo.   The  Arab  Renaissance  failed,  however,  because  the  Arab  world  remained  economically  poor.   “Humanism  is  not  for  the  poor,”  he  said.  “Fundmentalism  is.”  A  liberal  society  needs  a  middle  class  to  sus  tain  it  and  a  strong  economy  to  sus  tain  a  middle  class.  The  Arab  world  in  the  20th  century  didn’t  have  it;  what  it  had  was  poverty,  illiteracy  and  life  under  colonial  occupation.  Bourgeois   liberal  Arabs  left  for  the  West.   Dr  Qleibo  said  the  last  surviving  giant  of  the  Arab  Renaissance  is  Egyptian  Nobel  Prize-winning  novel  ist  Naguib  Mafouz.   In  the  resulting  “cultural  void”,  as  Dr  Qleibo  put  it,  Islam  could  not  be  interpreted  as  it  was  during  the  gold  en  age  in  Spain,  under  the  influence  of  Greek  philosophy.   In  the  context  of  life  in  the  Muslim  world  of  the  20th  century,  he  said,  Islam  received  a  “victim’s  interpreta   tion”.  And  this  is  the  Islam  that  everyone  knows  and  fears.   “What  you  are  dealing  with  is  fanaticism,”  said  Dr  Qleibo.  The  lead  ers  of  militant  Islam  interpret  the  religion  in  the  most  superficial  way,  in  line  with  their  hostile  political  objectives.   “The  problem  isn’t  religion  —  it’s  sociology.  Violence   grows  where  there  is   poverty  and  ignorance.”   Dr  Mohamed  Essawi,  director  of  the  Sharia  and   Islamic  Studies  College,  on  the  West  Bank.   He  cites  a  well-known  saying  of  Mohammed:  “When  you  see  some  thing  wrong,  correct  it  with  your  hand.  And  if  you  can’t,  then  correct  it  with  your  mouth.  And  if  you  can’t,  then  correct  it  in  your  heart.”   The  bin  Ladens  of  the  world,  he  said,  “hear  the  first  injunction,  but  not  the  second  two.  They  all  take  it  upon  themselves  to  correct  the  world’s  wrongs  with  their  hand.”   While  there  are  few  liberal  human  ists  among  Palestinians,  Dr  Qleibo  believes  there  are  few  supporters  of  the  World  Trade  Centre  assault.  The  TV  footage  of  Palestinians  handing  out  baklava  and  jumping  for  joy  on  11  September  was  a  gross  distortion  of  public  sentiment,  he  contended,  because  the  cameras  failed  to  focus  on  the  Palestinians  who  were  not  cel  ebrating,  and  these  are  the  “silent  majority”  of  local  Muslims.   ‘Their  main  concern  is  paying  their  bills,  sending  their  children  to  school.  They’re  not  politically  active.  More  over,  they’re  afraid,”  he  said  —  afraid  to  buck  the  spirit  of  the  street,  afraid  to   Arab  Israeli  Islamic  leader  Raed  Salah  condemns  violence  against  Innocent  people  during  a  rally  of  the  Islamic  movement  In  the   Arab  Israeli  town  of  Um  El-Fahem  a  few  days  after  the  World  Trade  Centre  and  Pentagon  attacks.

Israel’s  Islamic  movement  is   known  mainly  by  its  radical  “north  ern”  wing,  based  in  Umm  el-Fahm,  led  by  Sheikh  Ra’ed  Salah.  This  is  the  wing  that  has  produced  the  handful  of  Israeli  Arab  terrorists  who  have   been  caught  or  who  have  blown  themselves  up  in  recent  years.  This  is  the  wing  that  seems  ideologically  indistinguishable  from  Hamas.   But  the  Islamic  movement  was   founded  about  30  years  ago  by  a  more  moderate  figure,  Sheikh  Abdal  lah  Nimr  Darwish  of  Kafr  Kassem.   On  the  Friday  after  the  World  Trade  Centre  attacks,  Sheikh  Dar  wish  said  in  his  sermon  to  a  large  gathering,  including  many  Israeli  Arab  leaders,  that  the  attack  was  “a  crime  of  the  first  order.  Whoever  kills  citizens  at  work,  whoever  destroys  places  where  people  work  to  earn  a  livelihood,  whoever  destroys  some  one’s  livelihood  or  kills  innocent  civilians  —  he  can  claim  whatever  he  wants,  but  he  has  no  place  in  Islam.”   10  the  sheikh,  the  problem  lies  not  in  Islam,  but  in  the  way  JL  many  militant  Muslims  place  “blind  faith”  in  the  teachings  of  a  par  ticular  Muslim  authority.   Yet  Sheikh  Darwish  is  not  only  a  critic  of  radical  Islam,  but  also  an  apologist  for  it.  He  refused  to  lump  Hamas  in  with  bin  Laden,  saying  that  Hamas  is  “dedicated  to  expelling  the  Israeli  occupation  from  the  territo  ries,  while  no-one  knows  what  bin  Laden  is  dedicated  to”.   While  Sheikh  Darwish  opposes  Palestinian  terror  against  Israeli  civilians  in  “Israel  proper”,  viewing  it  as  the  killing  of  innocent  people,  he  legitimises  Palestinian  attacks  on   Israeli  soldiers  and  settlers.   “The  people  who  went  to  live  in  the  settlements  went  there  as  sol  diers,  as  warriors,”  he  maintained.   But  bin  Laden  is  a  whole  other  issue,  said  Sheikh  Darwish.  The  Saudi  exile  is  not  fighting  for  nation  al  liberation,  but  rather  is  waging  a  blood-soaked,  senseless  “war  of  cul  tures”  against  the  West.   Still,  Sheikh  Darwish  downplays   talk  of  a  “worldwide  network”  of  bin  Laden-sponsored  terrorists.   “This  is  being  blown  way  out  of  proportion.  There  are  a  few  dozen  men  who  fought  the  Soviet  occupa  tion  of  Afghanistan  for  10  years,  and  haven’t  been  able  to  readjust  to  civil  ian  society,”  he  contended.   Sheikh  Darwish  has  no  problem  with  pinpoint  attacks  on  bin  Laden’s  organisation  but  if  “Afghan  civilians  end  up  lying  dead  under  the  rubble”,  there  will  be  an  uproar  in  the  Muslim  world  and  he  will  join  it.   Until  1989,  the  training  of  Israeli  Arab  public  school  teachers  of  Islam  and  Arabic  was  conducted  at  insti  tutes  in  Hebron  and  Nablus.   Wishing  to  give  Israeli  Arab  teach  ers  a  less  hostile  grounding  in  Islam  than  they  were  getting  in  Hebron  and  Nablus,  the  Education  Ministry  authorised  the  founding  of  the  Sharia  (Islamic  law)  and  Islamic  Studies  College  in  Baka  al-Gharbiya,  an  Israeli  Arab  city  that  sits  on  the  border  of  the  West  Bank.   Today  the  only  other  teacher  training  college  for  Islam  is  in  Umm  el-Fahm,  but  it  is  not  accredited  by  the  Education  Ministry,  evidently  for  political  reasons,  according  to  Dr  Mohamed  Essawi,  director  of  the  Sharia  and  Islamic  Studies  College.   “When  we  first  started,  some  peo  ple  saw  us  as  collaborators,  but  with  time  that  changed,”  he  said.  Now  some  500  Israeli  Arab  teachers  are   trained  there  in  Islam  and  Arabic  instruction,  as  well  as  in  the  teaching  of  maths,  computers  and  English.   The  college’s  policy  is  “not  to  deal  with  politics.  Politics  screws  up  religion,”  said  Dr  Essawi.   Dr  Essawi  thinks  Israeli  Muslims  have  allowed  themselves  to  be  led  by  people  whose  agenda  is  far  more  militant  than  the  mainstream’s.   “Most  Muslims  here  have  practi  cal,  personal  goals;  they  just  want  to  improve  their  lives  little  by  little,”  he  said.  “These  people  in  Umm  el-Fahm  who  throw  rocks  and  want  to  return  to  Jaffa  —  that’s  not  us.”   Given  the  college’s  background  and  Dr  Essawi’s  statements,  one  doesn’t  need  to  ask  him  if  he  con  demns  bin  Laden  and  the  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Centre  and  the  Pen  tagon.  Instead  he  is  asked  how  this  deadly  strain  of  Islam  developed,   and  how  to  counteract  it.   “The  problem  isn’t  religion  —  it’s  sociology,”  he  said.  “Violence  grows  where  there  is  poverty  and  igno  rance.  The  children  of  doctors,  engi  neers  and  teachers  don’t  become  terrorists,  and  those  who  do  are  exceptions  to  the  rule.   “In  Canada  there  are  a  lot  of  Mus  lims  —  why  isn’t  there  any  violence  there?  Now  look  at  Afghanistan  —  the  people  go  barefoot,  they  have  nothing  to  eat.  If  the  people  in  Afghanistan  had  a  decent  standard  of  living,  would  the  Taliban  succeed?  I  don’t  think  so.”   The  answer  to  Islamic  militancy,  whether  in  Israel  or  Afghanistan,  he  maintained,  is  education  and  eco  nomic  progress.   “The  world  has  got  to  wake  up,”  said  Dr  Essawi.  “Give  these  poor,  disadvantaged  people  some  sup  port.  Lift  them  out  of  the  swamp  of   terror.   Jerusalem  Post ",2001-10-12
"  Peace   activists  meet  in  Sydney   Samantha  laden   UNDER  the  shadow  of  the  recent  terrorist  attacks  in  the  United  States,  a  group  of  people  commit  ted  to  propelling  the  cause  of  world  peace  met  in  Sydney  recently  under  the  banner  of  an  organisation  founded  in  Israel.   The  second  annual  Interna  tional  Forum  for  the  Culture  and  Literature  of  Peace  (IFLAC)  held  a  conference  for  the  culture  of  peace,  with  the  international  guests  and  local  members  dis  cussing  ways  to  strive  towards  the  promotion  of  peace  and  tol  erance  and  to  eliminate  violence.   “The  hard  times  we  are  going  through  make  the  work  of  IFLAC  —  to  spread  a  counter-culture  of  peace  —  more  important  and  urgent  than  ever,”  Israel-based  IFLAC  founder  and  president  Ada  Aharoni  told  the  Australian  Jew  ish  News.   “This  is  why  we  have  doubled  our  activities.  We  call  on  all  Aus  tralians  who  believe  that  commu  nication  and  culture  can  help  to  promote  a  climate  of  peace  to  join  our  efforts  in  bringing  reason  and  harmony  to  the  world  and  to  the  Middle  East.”   Ms  Aharoni  attended  the  con  ference  armed  with  a  draft  posi   tion  statement  on  the  terrorist  attack  on  the  US,  which  con  demned  terrorism  and  called  for  peaceful  negotiations  of  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict.   IFLAC  is  an  Israeli  initiative,  with  its  world  centre  in  Haifa.  It  is  supported  by  the  Haifa  Munici  pality  and  by  Haifa  Mayor  Amram   Mitzna.   “Haifa  is  a  city  of  coexistence  of  Jews,  Muslim  and  Christian  Arabs  and  Palestinians,”  Ms  Aha  roni  said.  “Haifa  can  be  a  model  of  coexistence  for  the  whole  of  the  Middle  East  and  the  global  village.”   Ms  Aharoni  describes  herself  as  an  academic,  writer,  poet  and  lecturer.  “I  was  born  in  Egypt  of  French  nationality,  and  I  studied  English  Literature  at  London  Uni  versity.  That  means  that  in  addi  tion  to  my  Israeli  identity  and  culture,  I  have  what  I  call  a  ‘glob  al  culture’,  which  facilitates  my  work  and  my  understanding  of  both  sides  of  the  Israeli  Arab  Palestinian  Conflict,  and  other   conflicts.”   Apart  from  her  work  with  IFLAC,  Ms  Aharoni  is  head  of  the  International  Peace  Research  Association  QPRA),  and  chair  of  the  Israel-England  Committee  of  the  World  Labor  Zionist  Move   ment.

The  stench  of  cat  piss  was  so  bad  it  made  you  forget  the  other  problems  around  the  place.  The  beast  in  question  was  a  very  daggy  tabby,  an  urban  feral.  Jo  had  given  him   sanctuary  and  half-tamed  him.  He  must  have  been  a  good-looking  kitten,  but  something  had  gone  terribly  wrong.  He  walked  with  a  stiff  arthritic  strut,  like  a  mechanical  toy,  he  had  a  prissy,  plaintive  voice,  his  neck  was  permanently  swollen,  he  dribbled,  his  muscles  were  tightly  bunched  and  he  was  always  distracted  and  jumpy.  Luckily,  there  wasn't  much  of  a  queue  at  the  vet  -  just  a  middle-aged  bloke  with  a  handlebar  moustache  who  looked  at  me   without  acknowledgement  and  a  white  bull-  terrier  bitch  with  piggy  little  eyes.  The  dog  ignored  the  cat,  but  she  growled  at  me.  ""Nice  doggie"",  I  said,  ""What's  she  called?""  ""Pauline"",  the  man  muttered  without  a  glance  in  my  direction.  Dr  Gupta's  silk  sari  rustled  as  she  ushered  me  into  the  surgery.  ""I  enjoy  your  visits,  Nick.  I  don't  often  have  the  luxury  of  talking  to  my  patients.  What's  the  problem?"".  ""I'm  afraid  I'm  having  a  relapse  of  Possum  Creek  fever.  Terrible  nightmares  again.  I  keep  seeing  ethnic  massacres  and  a  man  ranting  about  the  River  Tiber  flowing  with  much  blood"".  ""Indeed,  this  is  not  at  all  surprising,  It  is  hardly  a  dream"",  Dr  Gupta  said.  ""There  are  such  horrible  things  now,  they  are  giving  me  nightmares  also.""      She  spread  out  a  pile  of  newspaper  clippings  about  the  Great  Tampa  Afghan-  Lebo-Muslim  Bankstown  Rape  Crisis.  At  the  top  were  some  columns  from  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald  by  'senior  reporter'  Paul  Sheehan.  ""Let  us  put  this  problem  in  context"",  she  said.  ""We  have  had  a  spate  of  nasty  rapes,  committed  by  a  tiny  group  of  very  stupid  young  men  of  Lebanese  ancestry.  These  were  not  refugees,  but  people  born  or  raised  here.  They  were  not  at  all  typical.  In  the  past,  most  crimes  of  this  nature  were  committed  by  atypical  men  of  Christian  background.  ""Mr  Sheehan  is  pushing  a  lot  of  nasty  buttons  here.  Just  look  at  the  subtext:  filthy  Arabs  defiling  white  women.  What  a  demagogue!  ""Of  course  he  asserts  that  the  crimes  were  racially  or  ethnically  motivated.  What  dangerous  inflammatory  rot.  Criminals  usually  try  to  'justify'  their  crime  with  some  ideological  gloss  or  excuse  but  the  crime  is  motivated  by  the  desire  to  exercise  violent  power  over  women.  Remember  the  rape  of  Aboriginal  women  by  European  men.  Remember  'gin  jockeys'.  They  are  not  exactly  an  unknown  feature  of  European  colonisation.  ""At  first  Mr  Sheehan  is  hiding  as  usual  behind  the  claim  that  he  is  just  reporting  what  the  majority  believe,  but  then  he  begins  to  stir  in  some  new  mischief  of  his  own:  Lebanese  people  are  not  cost-effective  migrants,  he  says.  There  are  too  many  of  them  in  jail,  they  are  too  poor.  But  think  of  those  who  are  even  poorer  and  certainly  Over-represented  in  jail:  Aboriginal  people.  Today  it  is  Arabs,  tomorrow  it  will  be  Koories  ...  and  the  day  after'?  Vietnamese  perhaps,  some  of  whom  deal  drugs?  ""But  this  I  find  the  most  dangerous:  he     says  here  a  'large  Muslim  population  has  been  brought  into  this  country  with  barely  a  shred  of  consultation  or  consent'.  This  can  only  be  read  one  way:  'Christian'  Australia  should  be  asked  if  it  wants  to  accept  Muslims  as  migrants  or  refugees.  What  does  Mr  Sheehan  want  in  this  country?  a  Christian  theocracy?  that  a  person's  religion  should  be  a  basis  for  rejection?  ""My  understanding  of  our  Constitution  is  that  we  are  blind  to  religion.  That  is  a  very  fine  thing,  for  the  foundation  of  religious  freedom  -  as  well  as  the  freedom  not  to  believe  -  lies  in  the  secularity  of  the  state.""  ""Doc,  I  can't  disagree  with  a  word  of  that"",  I  said.  ""Mr  Possum,  I  think  we  may  have  found  the  problem"",  Dr  Gupta  said  when  I  went  back  to  the  surgery  in  the  afternoon  to  pick  up  the  cat.  ""The  scrotum  was  horribly  twisted,  and  one  testicle  was  up  inside  his  body.  It  must  have  caused  him  pain  and  irritation.  It  was  leaking,  and  semen  was  backing  up  under  the  skin.  It  may  even  have  backed  up  into  the  brain.  I  am  thinking  that  this  may  have  caused  the  hormones  to  run  out  of  control,  inflamming  all  his  glands.  This  would  explain  why  his  neck  is  so  swollen.  The  poor  thing,  we  must  keep  an  eye  on  his  progress.""  She  gave  me  some  industrial-strength  flea  treatment  plus  a  free  cat  collar  with  little  bells  on  it  to  warn  the  local  wildlife,  and  started  to  fill  out  his  patient  card.

"  Rocking  the  boat  why  I  protested  against  the  PM   VIEWPOINT   Mark  Baker   AS  a  student,  I  wrote  a   research  paper  on  a  famine   that  took  root  in  Lithuania  in  1867.1  spent  my  days  reading  news  paper  reports  in  Hebrew  and  Yid  dish  about  the  Jews  who  were  hardest  hit  by  the  famine.  For  most  of  the  victims,  there  was  no  way  out  of  the  severe  hunger;  the  relief  operations  were  not  adequate  to  quell  the  rising  death  toll.  In  des  peration,  thousands  of  families  col  lected  whatever  they  could  on  to  their  backs  and  fled  toward  the  Prussian  border.  Most  were  turned  away.  With  few  exceptions,  the  Prussian  Jewish  community  turned  their  faces  away,  frightened  to  look  at  what  the  erasure  of  borderlines  had  brought  to  their  doorsteps.   There  will  always  be  people  who  will  push  against  the  boundaries.  As  long  as  there  are  people  in  need,  our  borders  —  national,  personal,  and  legal  —  will  be  challenged.  Judaism  has  always  preached  an,  ethic  of  openness.  Abraham’s  tents  were  declared  beautiful  because  they  were  open  on  all  sides  to  strangers  who  passed  by.  At  the  seder  table   we  open  the  door  and  sing,  Kol  dich  phin  yetei  ve-yeychol  —  “Whoever  is  hungry,  come  in.”  John  Donne,  put  it  like  this:  “No  man  is  an  island.”  We  are  all  connected  to  each  other.  Their  problem  is  our  problem.   The  way  we  respond  to  the  plight  of  people  in  need  is  a  meas  ure  of  our  own  holiness  and  human  ity.  You  don’t  have  to  take  the  words  of  the  Torah  literally  to  pass  the  test.  In  an  ideal  world,  we  would  open  our  doors  no  matter  what.  In  the  real  world,  we  must  find  a  more  balanced  way  to  allow  an  ethic  of  compassion  to  guide  how  we  assert  our  boundaries,  regulate  the  flow  of  migration,  maintain  control  of  our  own  national  sovereignty.   When  John  Howard  talks  about  “Australia’s  immigration  problem”,  he  denies  our  connection  to  the  problems  of  others.  From  talkback  radio  to  our  own  livingrooms,  we   have  adopted  his  cruel  and  dispas  sionate  language.  We  erase  the  humanity  of  people  in  despair  by  keeping  them  faceless  and  not  listen  ing  to  their  pleas.  We  harden  our  hearts  because  we  fear  being  a  “soft  touch”.  We  demonise  the  refugees  by  calling  them  queue-jumpers  and  assuage  our  conscience  by  pretend  ing  they  are  wealthy  and  privileged.  Our  crack-force  military  units  appear  out  of  nowhere  to  create  the  impres  sion  of  a  state  of  national  emergency.  The  boats  represent  the  face  of  the  enemy,  a  threat  we  have  to  fight  by  introducing  wartime  legislation.   We  look  away  because  we  are  scared  to  imagine  the  refugees  face   to-face.   It  is  a  familiar  agenda,  one  that  in  the  past  has  won  votes  for  Pauline  Hanson.  The  crisis  has  given  John  Howard  the  card  he  has  been  look  ing  for;  the  ability  to  reject  an  elec  toral  deal  with  Hanson,  while  winning  votes  by  mainstreaming  her  agenda  across  Australia.  Sadly,  many  Jews  have  accepted  the  deal.   That  is  why  1  chose  to  demon  strate  against  John  Howard  at  a   Jewish  function  organised  by  the  Australia-Israel  Chamber  of  Com  merce  last  week.  I  carried  a  placard  that  said:  “St  Louis,  1939.  Exodus,  1947.  Tampa,  2001.”   As  many  people  have  pointed  out,  there  are  many  differences  between  the  past  and  the  present.  I  agree.  But  we  should  never  allow   the  dissimilarities  to  desensitise  us  to  the  parallels.  When  the  Torah  says  we  should  remember  the  widow  and  the  orphan  “because  we  were  once  slaves  in  Egypt”  it  calls  upon  us  to  use  history  as  a  guide  to  compassion,  not  as  a  shield  for  our  own  unique  pain.   When  the  communal  heavies   were  brought  out  to  pressure  me  to  discard  my  placard,  I  was  told  that  John  Howard  is  a  great  friend  of  Israel.  That  we  are  giving  him  a   humanitarian  award  next  week.  That  the  issues  are  indivisible.   To  me  they  are  divisible.  Yes,  Howard  is  a  great  friend  of  Israel,  and  for  this  he  should  be  applauded.  But  he  is  no  humanitarian  —  not  on  the  issue  of  Tampa,  and  not  on  the  issue  of  indigenous  rights  in  Australia.  The   Jewish  community  should  not  be  seen  to  be  labelling  him  a  humanitar  ian  because  of  his  friendship  to  us.  It  compromises  us  as  Jews,  it  compro  mises  us  as  Australians.  It  diminishes  the  idea  of  humanity.   In  a  world  where  Islamic  forces  have  gathered  in  Durban  and  the  Mid  dle  East  to  declare  a  war  against  Jews,  we  cannot  ignore  the  dangers  we  face  now  and  in  the  future.  But  it  would  be  a  grave  mistake  to  turn  away  from  the  entire  Muslim  world  and  withhold  compassion  to  refugees  from  Afghanistan.  Tragically,  the  war  of  ter  ror  against  the  Jews  in  Israel  has  turned  every  Palestinian  in  our  eyes  into  a  chefetz  chashud—  a  “suspicious  object”.  We  cannot  afford  to  tr  eat  the  entire  Muslim  world  in  this  way.  That  is  a  war  too  big  for  us  to  fight.   Australia  has  in  the  past  proved  that  we  are  a  country  of  compas  sion.  At  the  Olympics,  we  paraded  to  the  world  our  innate  sense  of  decency  and  openness.  The  past  week  has  been  a  barometer  of  how  fragile  these  values  are.  In  the  end,  we  will  all  be  the  losers.   ■  Mark  Baker  is  a  Jewish  historian. ",2001-09-14
"  Members  learn  about  Turkey   Charlton  WAB   MEMBERS  of  the  Charlton  branch  of  Women  in  Agriculture  and  Business  had  an  informative  Christmas  meeting  at  Julie  Low's  home  on  December  4.  There  were  17  members  present,  including  regional  councillor  Barbara  Millard  and  guest  speaker  Shirley  Saunders.  Mrs  Saunders  spoke  about  her  trip  to  Turkey  with  a  Christian  ""Company""  to  teach  English  as  a  second  language.  Along  with  husband  Geoff  she  was  able  to  learn  the  customs  and  history  of  the  country  by  living  and  mixing  with  the  local  people.  The  history  of  the  country  goes  back  7000  years  and  there  have  been  seven  invasions,  so  there  was  a  lot  to  learn.  The  people  were  mainly  Muslim  but  not  all  follow  the  strict  rules,  with  some  Christians  and  other  religions  present  as  well.  They  travelled  extensively,  especially  in  the  western  part  of  the  country  and  found  the  people  warm  and  welcoming,  but  the  traffic  was  horrendous.  Although  there  are  private  schools,  all  children  are  entitled  to  free  education  up  to  Year  12  and   there  are  many  universities.  Train  travel  is  slow  and  the  bazaars  very  large,  with  food  of  all  sorts  available  but  not  necessarily  displayed  in  a  way  we  would  like.  There  are  approximately  60  million  people  in  a  country  not  quite  as  large  as  the  Northern  Territory  so  there  are  a  lot  of  small  houses  as  well  as  the  homes  of  the  wealthy.  There  is  a  big  difference  between  the  ""haves  and  the  have  nots"".  They  grow  cotton  (which  is  picked  by  hand)  and  have  large  areas  of  tobacco,  cereal  crops,  fruit  and  vegetables.  There  is  also  a  vast  manufacturing  industry  and  plenty  of  livestock.  While  in  the  area  they  visited  Gallipoli  and  Troy  to  see  the  ""wooden  horse"",  and  other  tourist  places.  Mrs  Saunders  said  it  was  a  wonderful  experience  and  she  advised  the  members  to  ""value  each  other""  because  the  freedom  women  have  to  mix  in  Australia  is  not  available  in  some  other  countries.  The  next  meeting  will,  be  at  Myrtle  Seaman's  home  on  Tuesday,  .February  5,  2002,  after  having  met  at  the  Seahorse  Farm  at  7.30pm  The  meeting  finished  with  a  lovely  supper  and  president  Helen  Mitchell  wished  all  a  happy  Christmas  and  healthy  new  year.

For  if  the  nations  of  the  world  will  say  to  you  listim  atem  —  that  you  are  [armed]  robbers  —in  that  you  captured  the  lands  of  the  seven  nations,  say  to  them  All  the  earth  belongs  to  the  Holy  One  blessed  be  He,  He  created  it  and  he  gave  it  to  the  one  that  was  appro  priate  in  his  eyes  ...”’  (Rashi,  Bereshit  1:1).   SPEAKING  in  Melbourne  last   August,  former  Prime  Minis  ter  Binyamin  Netanyahu  addressed  the  difficulties  facing  Israel  in  the  context  of  the  media  war  being  waged  against  us.   Referring  to  the  “document”  —  i.e.  the  Tenach  —  that  we  have  to  prove  our  unassailable  claim  to  the  land,  he  regretted  the  fact  that  even  among  our  own  people  our  claim  is  not  fully  appreciated.   He  also  made  another  very  basic  point  that  needs  to  be  taken  into  account  when  we  face  the   propaganda  barrage  that  attempts  to  delegitimise  our  posi  tion  —  a  barrage  that  since  his  speech  has  extended  to  distin  guish  between  terror  that  needs  to  be  uprooted,  and  more  “under  standable/acceptable”  actions  against  Israel,  given  Israel’s  refusal  to  accede  to  all  Palestinian  claims.   It  is  often  argued  that  by  virtue  of  creation  of  the  refugee  prob  lem,  Israel  is  responsible  for  dis  placement  of  millions  of  people  whose  roots  in  the  Holy  Land  date  back  to  antiquity.  Thus  it  is  implied  that  we  stole  a  land  to  which  others  held  title  long  before   our  arrival.   Leaving  aside  the  obvious—as  so  succinctly  put  by  Rabbi  Chaim  Gutnick  at  the  same  August  gath  ering,  that  when  Jesus  walked  the  streets  of  Jerusalem  he  did  not  see  any  mosques  or  even  church  es  —  there  are  more  recent  his  toric  aspects  of  demographic  reality  that  should  be  remem  bered.   A  consequence  of  the  19th-cen  tury  advent  of  the  steamship  and  railway  was  increased  interest  in  newly  facilitated  travel.  The  visit  to  the  Orient,  and  particularly,  the  lands  of  the  Bible,  become  a  must  for  the  adventurous  and  energetic  upper  class  of  England  and  West  ern  Europe.  This  new-found  inter  est  was  also  reflected  in  the  literature  of  the  era.   Many  a  novelist  described  their  travels  in  the  region.  One  example  provided  by  Netanyahu  was  Mark  Twain’s  description  of  his  1867  travels  including  the  Holy  Land,  published  in  Hie  Innocents  Abroad  many  years  before  his  bet  ter  known  The  Adventures  of  Tom  Sawyer  (1876)  and  Huckleberry  Finn  (1884/5).   But  beyond  the  publication  of  travelogues  and  novels  which  were  generally  increasing  in  popu  larity  as  literacy  improved  whilst  printing  techniques  made  books  more  affordable,  the  advent  of  photography  and  new  techniques  of  illustration  also  led  to  publica  tion  of  increasing  numbers  of  pic   torial  albums  and  illustrated   guidebooks.  Classics  of  the  era  range  from  David  Roberts’s  An  Antique  Land  to  Sir  Charles  Wil  son’s  Picturesque  Palestine.   All  of  that  literature  has  a  fasci  nating  common  thread.  None  of  those  who  faithfully  recorded  their  impressions  appeared  to  have  discovered  a  land  teeming   with  Arabs  —  or  for  that  matter  Christians  or  even  Jews.  Prior  to  1880  and  the  first  aliyah  Jerusalem  had  a  substantial  Jewish,  Muslim  and  Christian  population,  but  the  rest  of  what  was  then  simply  Southern  Syria  —  not  in  any  way  a  political  entity  of  its  own  —  was  largely  empty  wasteland.   Small  villages  dotted  the  land  scape  and  fellahin  worked  open  fields,  but  that  was  all.  It  was  not  until  the  advent  of  Zionist  agricul  tural  settlement  showed  the  potential  of  the  land  and  their  infrastructure  development  began,  that  the  Arab  inhabitants  of  neighbouring  countries  began   to  enter  the  land  —  let  alone   began  seeing  themselves  as  a  sep  arate  entity.   Politically  incorrect  and  unpopular  as  it  may  be,  the  reality  is  that  there  was  no  Palestinian  entity  for  Zionism  to  displace;  nor   was  there  then  a  nation  of  Pales  tinian  residents.  And  as  Netanyahu  pointed  out,  in  an  ear  lier  era  the  political  leaders  of  the  world  knew  it  —  ranging  from  Kaiser  Wilhelm  II  who  visited  in  1898  to  Winston  Churchill  who  served  as  British  undersecretary  for  the  colonies  during  the  first  decade  of  the  20th  century.   “A  duty  devolves  upon   ‘you’  —all  of  Israel—to   know  the  truth  and  to   emphasise  it  at  all  times.”   Whilst  those  facts  do  not  negate  the  feeling  of  the  current  Muslim  residents  of  the  land  who  reside  there,  were  bom  there  or  lived  there  in  recent  times,  they  are  very  relevant  to  the  argu  ments  which  are  used  to  delegit   imise  Israel’s  claim  to  the  land  —  and  which  are  heard  more  and  more  in  light  of  the  claims  for  refugees  to  return  to  their  ances   tral  homelands.   Rashi’s  first  message  in  Bereshit  is  the  teaching  that  our  claim  to  the  land  is  real;  the  Torah  is  our  title  to  the  land.  And  it  is   worthwhile  emphasising  the  lin  guistic  nuances  implicit  in  Rashi’s  comment.  For  we  are  told  in  the  lines  cited  at  the  outset  of  this  column  “if  the  nations  will  say  to  you  [i.e.  Israel]...  then  you  [Israel]  shall  say...”  There  is  an  emphasis  on  a  duty  that  devolves  upon  “you”  —  all  the  house  of  Israel  —  to  know  the  truth  and  to  empha   sise  it  at  all  times.   While  we  have  survived  a  lengthy  exile  without  physically  residing  in  the  land,  the  reality  is  that  Torah,  the  people  and  the  land  are  inextricably  intertwined.  But  if  we  ourselves  do  not  realise  and  promote  those  facts,  then  how  can  we  expect  them  to  be  accepted  and  understood  by  oth  ers?   Shabbat  shalom,  Yossi ",2001-10-12
"  Fury  as  Reform  rabbi  likens  Orthodox  to  terrorists   Julie  Wiener   NEW  YORK  —  American  Orthodox   Jewish  leaders  are  outraged  at  an   Israeli  Reform  leader’s  comments  drawing  comparisons  between  ultra-Orthodox  Jews  and  the  Islamic  terrorists  who  attacked  the  World  Trade  Centre  and  the  Pentagon.   But  Rabbi  Uri  Regev,  director  of  the  Israel  Religious  Action  Centre  —  which  promotes  religious  pluralism  in  Israel  —  stands  by  a  speech  he  gave  at  an  Ohio  temple.   Speaking  on  Islamic  terrorism,  he  said:  “In  Israel  we  have  our  own  religious  extremists  who  feel  they  have  the  right  to  rule  other  people’s  lives,  spreading  the  venom  of  religious  fundamentalism.”   Regev  asserted  that  some  ultra  Orthodox  leaders  in  Israel  have  used  hate-filled  language  to  des   cribe  Liberal  and  secular  Jews  and  their  institutions.  He  also  said  ultra  Orthodox  Jews  are  believed  to  be  behind  recent  acts  of  vandalism  and  arson  against  Liberal  institutions.   “We  need  to  band  together  to  fight  religious  zealots  on  both  the  Palestinian  and  Israeli  sides,”  he  was  reported  as  saying.  “If  we  don’t  learn  from  September  11,  we  haven’t  learned  anything.”   Orthodox  leaders  bristled  at  the  comparison  with  Muslim  terrorists.  “How  can  you  even  think  about  comparing  a  Jew  of  any  sort  to  the  Arabs  who  flew  into  the  World  Trade  Centre  and  killed  5000   innocent   people?”  asked  Rabbi  Pesach  Lemer  of  the  National  Council  of  Young  Israel.   Lemer,  who  is  calling  for  R  e  g  e  v  ’  s  resignation,  said  no  ultra  Orthodox  Jews  have  been  proven   Rabbi  Uri  Regev   guilty  oi  vandalism  against  LiDerai  institutions.   Rabbi  Avi  Shafran  of  Agudath  Israel  of  America  said  Regev  is  wco   opting  the  horror  the  world  is  feeling  against  Islamic  terrorists  in  his  fight  against  religious  Jews”.   Comparing  ultra-Orthodox  Jews  to  “these  evil  people  who  murdered  thousands  is  beyond  the  realm  of  comprehension”,  said  Rabbi  Dovid   Eliezrie  of  California.   Regev  said  he  was  not  criticising  all  ultra-Orthodox,  but  stood  by  his  speech.  “It’s  fundamentalist  hate  speech  that  precedes  those  outbursts  that  we  should  be  concerned  about  addressing.”   He  drew  attention  to  a  September  7  article  in  the  ultra-Orthodox  newspaper  Yated  Ne’eman  describing  Liberal  Jews  as  “destroyers  of  religion”,  “criminals”   and  enemies  of  God  .

"  Ambitious  interfaith  program  for  2001   NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews   president  Henry  Mendelson.   THE  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  has   put  together  an  ambitious  program  of  interfaith   activities  for  2001.   As  well  as  maintaining  its  bimonthly  Lun  cheon  Club—which  will  hear  presentations  on  “A  Century  of  Australian  Religious  Leadership”  at  the  Great  Synagogue  —  it  will  conduct  a  Passover  demonstration  for  non-Jewish  audi  ences  in  the  western  suburbs  and  will  under  take  a  major  seminar  series  dealing  with  issues  related  to  interfaith  understanding.   In  addition,  a  Jewish-Muslim  poetry  presen  tation  is  planned  for  May,  to  be  accompanied  by  musical  components.  This  follows  up  on  a  similar  successful  event  last  year.   On  the  Holocaust,  the  Council  will  continue  its  informational  program,  which  includes  an  annual  Shoah  Commemoration  in  the  crypt  of  St  Mary’s  Cathedral  and  a  Holocaust  theatrical  presentation  for  Gentile  students.  The  Holo   caust  seminar   for  Gentile  teaching  personnel  will  also  be  revived  under  the  direction  of  Rabbis  Raymond  Apple,  Richard  Lampert  and  David  Freedman.   The  Kristall  n  a  c  h  t   (Night  of   Broken  Glass)  com   memora   tion  will  be  held  at  the  Martin  Place  Ceno  taph,  and  a   debate  on  religious  intolerance  will  be  staged  later  in  the  year.   NSW  Governor  Marie  Bashir  has  agreed  to   continue   the  Council  s  vice-regai  patronage  wmcn  was   inaugurated  last  year  by  her  predecessor,  Gor   don  Samuels.   NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  presi  dent  Henry  Mendelson  said  the  programming  for  2001  indicates  growing  acceptance  of  the  need  to  pursue  initiatives  designed  to  engender  interfaith  understanding  and  to  encourage  dia  logue  in  all  its  forms  between  the  denomina  tions.  “We  saw  this  to  a  greater  degree  than  ever  before  last  year,  so  we  are  encouraged  that  the  community  will  support  this  work  in  a  broader  measure  in  the  years  to  come”,  he  said.   He  acknowledged  the  support  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  Sydney  Jewish  Muse  um  and  National  Council  of  Jewish  Women.  “There  is  a  genuine  desire  on  behalf  of  such  organisations  and  of  their  non-Jewish  counter  parts  throughout  NSW  to  come  to  grips  with  mutual  problems  related  to  lack  of  understand  ing  and  intolerance.  Moreover,  there  is  a  greater  acceptance  for  the  Council  to  be  the  catalyst  to  bring  about  solutions  to  such  prob   lems.” ",2001-03-09
"  Islam  in  Australia  —  thorny  issues   Stefan  Bialoguski   IN  a  bid  to  counter  misinformed  comment  on  Islam  following  the  September  11  attack  on  the  United  States,  the  Community  Relations  Commission  of  New  South  Wales  hosted  a  multi-faith  forum  examining  the  religion’s  place  in  Australian  society.   Premier  Bob  Carr  suggested  the  forum  at  a  meeting  with  leaders  of  the  state’s  100,000  Muslims  to  discuss  their  security  concerns.   “Boys  and  girls  of  Arabic  background  and  Islamic  faith  feel  uncomfortable  or  threatened,  and  I  consider  that  a  terrible  thing  in  our  society,”  he  told  the  forum.   The  atmosphere  among  the  100  people  at  the  University  of  Sydney  was  cordial,  but  that  did  not  prevent  thorny  issues  being  raised.   Although  the  motivation  for  the  forum  was,  in  part,  to  prevent  further  victimisation  of  Muslims,  it  was  noted  that  Muslims  had  not  been  the  only  targets  of  hate  and  violence.   Mr  Carr:  “Harmony  is  under  threat  —  from  terrorism  overseas,  from  the  war  in  Afgh  anistan,  from  the  argument  over  Australia’s  approach  to  refugees.  There  have  been  cases  of  women  having  hijabs  [veils]  forcefully  removed,  there  have  been  attacks  against  mosques  and  churches;  and  synagogues  have  been  under  attack  for  ten  years.”   “When  something  happens  like  a   firebomb  attack  against  a  synagogue,  how  many  people  from  other  religions   offer  assistance?  Get  off  your  backside  and  do  something.""   Anglican  Bishop  of  South  Sydney  Robert  Forsyth  said  Anglican  Australians  were  “poorly-informed”  about  Islam.   But  he  echoed  Great  Synagogue  Senior  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple’s  sentiment,  expressed  in  the  Australian  Jewish  News  some  months  ago,  that  more  needs  to  be  heard  from  Islamic  leaders  about  the  behaviour  of  some  members  of  their  communities.   “The  murder  of  Anglican  Christians  in  Pakistan,  the  persecution  of  Christians  in  Sudan,  Nigeria  and  Indonesia,  are  of  concern.  Relations  between  Anglicans  and  Muslims  would  be  helped  if  there  could  be  clarity  on  the  attitude  of  Muslims  to  these  issues  of  religious  persecution.”   Lack  of  clarity  was  also  exhibited  over  links  to  antisemitic  websites  on  the  home  page  of  a  Muslim  participant  at  the  forum.   Lebanese  Muslim  Association  vice  president  Keysar  Trad  said  he  was  “shocked  to  discover”  the  links  to  websites  such  as  Radio  Islam  on  his  home  page  after  being  alerted  to  them  by  a  Courier  Mail  journalist.   Radio  Islam  contains  extracts  from  Hitler’s  Mein  Kampf,  as  well  as  The  Protocols  of  the  Elders  of  Zion.   The  problem  of  the  website  links  had  been  identified  in  an  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewiy  report  on  antisemitism.   Mr  Trad,  an  assistant  to  Lakemba  Mosque  Sheikh  Tajeddin  A1  Hilaly,  whom  SBS  filmed  praising  suicide  bombers  after  the  Sbarro  terrorist  attack  in  Jerusalem,  told  the  forum:   “I  was  told  today  that  someone  had  told  me  a  couple  of  years  ago  to  check  the  links.  The  irony  is  that  as  soon  as  I  removed  them,  the  service-provider  crashed  and  now  uses  ...  my  website  of  several  months  ago,  and  I  can’t  change  it.  That  leaves  me  with  a  bad  feeling  that  I  have  offended  people  when  I  was  trying  to  promote  harmony.”   Forum  participant  Jeremy  Jones  (now  president  of  the  ECAJ),  had  told  the  Courier  Mail  that  Mr  Trad’s  professed  ignorance  regarding  the  websites  was  “not  credible”.   The  Courier  Mail  also  reported  that  Mr  Trad  had  translated  articles  for  the  “pro-terrorist”  magazine  Nida’ul  Islam,  organ  of  the  Islamic  Youth  Movement,  some  of  whose  members  have  been  raided  by  ASIO  recently.   Mr  Jones  called  for  unity  among  ethnic  groups  against  racism,  noting  that  there  were  an  average  of  one  reported  incident  a  day  of  racial  violence  against  the  Jewish  community  in  the  12  months  ending  September  30.   “It’s  significant  for  all  parts  of  Australian  society  if  any  group  is  targeted  for  vilification  and  violence.  Working  together,  we  have  the  best  chance  of  reinforcing  the  idea  that  if  you  attack  any  segment  of  the  mosaic,  you  are  attacking  the  whole  of  society.   “There  are  people  we  may  label  extremists  who  want  to  tell  Muslims  how  evil  Jews  are,  and  vice  versa.  It’s  important  to  recognise  that  those  people  don’t  act  in  any  of  our  interests.”   University  of  Sydney  Associate  Professor  of  Arab,  Islamic  and  Middle  Eastern  Studies  Ahmad  Shboul  said  the  so-called  clash  of  civilisations  since  September  11  was  not  a  conflict  between  the  Western  world  and  Islam.   “It’s  a  clash  between  narrow  understanding  of  religion  and  an  open  understanding  of  religion.  We  need  to  make  a  distinction  between  Islam  as  a  religious  faith  and  Islamism  —  a  political  nationalist  ideology  which  uses  Islam  for  political  purposes.”   The  University  of  Damascus-educated  academic  said  these  Islamists  numbered  only  10,000  of  the  world’s  1.2  billion  Muslims.  “These  extremists  are  a  minority.  Their  view  is  directed  against  other  Muslims,  as  well  as  non-Muslims.  They  quote  religious  texts  out  of  context  ...  The  absence  of  democracy  in  [Islamic]  countries  because  of  low  socio  economic  development  explains  what  is  happening  —  not  Islam.”   Representing  the  Association  of  Engaged  Buddhists,  Venerable  Tejadhammo  Bikkhu  urged  those  present  to  implement  the  lessons  from  the  forum.   “I’m  sick  of  talk-fests.  When  something  happens  like  a  firebomb  attack  against  a  synagogue,  how  many  people  from  other  religions  offer  assistance?  I  suspect  the  answer  is  small.  If  there  are  attacks  against  people  of  Islam,  how  many  people  of  other  religions  do  anything?  Get  off  your  backside  and  do  something.  If  someone  attacks  a  mosque,  and  be  with  those  people.” ",2001-12-14
"  [?]   We,  the  members  of  the  Australian  Defence  Organisation,  have  all  been  shocked  and  deeply  sad  dened  by  the  terrorist  attacks  on  the  United  States  on  1  1  September.  In  this  situation  our  organisational  respon-   sibility  is  to  fulfil  our  mission  and  provide  a  measured  response  that  will  best  protect  Australia's  interests.  We  are  also  dealing  with  our  feelings  as  individuals,  shaped  by  our  many  and  varied  connections  with  the  United  States.  Many  of  us  have  family,  friends  or  colleagues  cur  rently  residing  there  or  have  established  friendships  with  members  of  the  US  Department  of  Defense  through  our  close  mutual  defence  interests.  Others  may  be  working  with  members  of  the  US  staff  posted  to  Australia  and  many  of  us  have  other  personal  relationships  with  the  people  of  the  United  States.  Just  as  our  connections  and  feelings  are  many  and  varied  so  may  be  our  responses.  We  take  the  opportunity,  there  fore,  to  remind  all  members  of  the  Defence  Organisation  that  there  are  measures  in  place  to  assist  in  these  difficult  times.  The  Defence  Psychology  Organisation  and  the  Defence  Community  Organisation  are  available  to  assist  ADF  members,  including  single  members,  and  their  fami  lies.  Civilians  have  access  to  the  Employee  Assistance   Program.  You  may  prefer  just  talking  it  over  with  your  supervisor  or  another  trusted  colleague  or  friend.  Most  importantly  this  should  occur  before  a  situation  becomes  overwhelming.  Following  these  tragic  events,  the  Prime  Minister  has  emphasised  the  importance  of  Australian  multiculturalism  to  our  nation.  Irrespective  of  anyone's  country  of  origin  or  religious  faith,  we  seek  to  ensure  that  all  personnel  are  aware  of  the  importance  which  we  accord  to  treating  every  body  in  Defence  fairly.  Unfairness,  harassment  or  discrimi  nation  in  any  form  will  not  be  tolerated.  We  are  particular  ly  concerned  that  our  Muslim  colleagues  are  not  discrimi  nated  against  in  anyway.  We  all  bring  to  Defence  a  variety  of  different  skills  and  knowledge,  and  we  are  all  needed  to  ensure  that  Defence  does  what  it's  here  for  —  to  defend  Australia  and  its  national  interests.

"  president  mosne  Katsav  reads  from  tne  Torah  at   the  Western  Wall.   Photo:  Isranet   IT  was  as  if  there  was  a  special  force  at  work  during  Choi  Hamoed  Succot  when  Jerusalem  suddenly  became  alive  with  people  and  festiv   ities.   &amp;lt;  &gt;  i  Despite  the  news  of  the  crash  of  the  Russian   airliner  and  the  terror  attack  in  Afula,  thou  sands  of  people  flocked  to  the  capital  to  enjoy   the  Succot  festivities.   It  was  like  old  times  as  Jews  walked  through  the  Muslim  Quarter  of  the  Old  City  on  their  way  to  the  Kotel  to  witness  the  Hakhel  cere   mony.   President  Katsav  followed  the  ancient  law  in  the  Torah  (Deuteronomy  31:10)  that  com  mands  that  all  Jews  gather  in  Jerusalem  during  the  Succot  holiday,  that  follows  the  seventh  &amp;lt;£.  pear  year-of-release  (sh’mitti),  to  hear  the   Torah  read.  A  sh’mita  year,  5761,  ended  last   month  at  Rosh  Hashanah.   In  ancient  times,  the  king  would  read  cer  tain  portions  from  the  Torah  to  the  assembled  crowds.  According  to  Jewish  religious  law,  this  precept,  like  many  others,  is  in  abeyance  as  long  as  the  Temple  is  destroyed.   Yet  although  the  actual  mitzuah  is  not  now  halachically  binding,  the  ceremony  has  been  revived  in  modem  Israel.  Just  before  dusk  on  the  eve  of  Hoshana  Rabbah,  the  President  and  Israeli  Chief  Rabbis  read  a  portion  of  the  Torah  »iV&gt;to  thousands  of  worshippers  gathered  by  the   Kotel  for  the  occasion.   Earlier  in  the  afternoon,  in  the  west  of  the  city,  thousands  of  spectators  watched  as  an  estimated  5000  people  marched  through  the  city  in  the  annual  Succot  parade.   More  than  half  the  marchers  were  Christian  pilgrims  from  about  60  countries  and  they  had  come  specially  to  Israel  to  express  their  sup  port  for  the  Jewish  state.   The  spectators  gave  the  evangelical  Christ  ian  groups  rousing  cheers  as  they  made  their  way  through  the  city.  There  was  a  special  poignancy  this  year  as  the  marchers  danced  and  sang  in  front  of  the  newly  refurbished  and  opened  Sbarro  pizza  restaurant  which  was  the  scene  of  the  suicide  bombing  that  took  15  lives   earlier  this  year.

"  Books  EH   Coming  to  terms  with  fundamentalism   PUBLISHER  Basic  Books  cele   brated  50  years  of  printing  recently  by  holding  a  sympo  sium  which  focused  on  “The  Future  of  the  Public  Intellectual”.   Basic  Books  has  done  much  to  contribute  to  public  debate  over  the  last  50  years.  Among  its  authors  have  been  Erik  Erikson,  who  coined  the  term  “identity  crisis”,  Swiss  developmental  theorist  Jean  Piaget  and  anthropologist  Claude  Levi  Strauss.   At  the  conference  the  one  who   probably  contributed  most  to  the  debate  was  Columbia  University  sociologist  Herbert  Gans,  who  stat  ed  that  public  intellectuals  often  act  merely  as  suppliers  of  quotes  for  journalists.  “If  no  journalist  calls,  I’m  not  a  public  intellectual,”  he  quipped.   Basic  Books  was  founded  in  1950  by  Arthur  Rosenthal,  who  trans  formed  a  book  club  which  marketed  books  to  psychoanalysts  into  a  force  to  be  reckoned  with  in  the  publishing  world.  In  its  early  days  it  was  often  called  the  “House  that  Freud  built”.  Today  it  publishes  many  interesting  titles,  some  of  which  have  a  strong  Jewish  theme,  such  as  Rabbi  Adin  Steinsalz’s  Essential  Talmud  and  Robert  Alter’s  The  Art  of  Biblical  Narrative.

How  else  would  you  assess  a  woman  who  was  a  Roman  Catholic  nun  for  seven   years,  now  teaches  at  London’s  Leo  Baeck  College  for  the  Study  of  Judaism  and  the  Training  of  Rabbis  and  Teachers,  and  won  the  Muslim  Public  Affairs  Council  Media  Medal?   Subtitled  Fundamentalism  in  Judaism,  Christianity  and  Islam,  her  book  shows  where  the  three  creeds  have  common  roots,  but  also  points  out  great  differences   between  them.   Jewish  fundamentalism,  in  broad  terms,  is  a  response  to  the  terrible  disasters  which  have  overtaken  us,  whereas  in  the  case  of  Islam,  fun  damentalism  was  nourished  by  secular  Western  political  systems  being  imposed  on  backward,  main  ly  rural  societies.  Meanwhile,  America,  the  birthplace  of  Christian  fundamentalism,  is  a  country  in  which,  rhetoric  notwith  standing,  democracy  in  its  usual  sense  has  never  been  really  accept  ed  and  where  a  modern  rational  secular  society  highlights  lives  lacking  in  meaning  and  spirituality.   Many  of  us  would  agree  with  fun  damentalists  insofar  as  they  find  modern  society  ugly  and  some  times  repulsive.  No  wonder  they  want  to  withdraw.  Moreover,  it  is  true  that  rationalism  leaves  unsat  isfied  the  yearning  many  have  for  an  answer  to  the  question  of  what  our  lives  are  all  about.  Jean-Paul  Sartre  writes  of  the  “God-shaped  hole  in  modern  consciousness”.   Two  frequently-used  terms  are  mythos  and  logos.  Logos  refers  to  rational  discourse,  mythos  to  the  mysterious,  the  spiritual,  the  diffi  cult-to-understand.  While  many  believe  that  holy  writ  is  metaphor  ical,  fundamentalists  believe  you  should  take  every  word  literally,  that  is,  that  the  world  was  created  5761  years  ago.  They  have  suc  ceeded  in  creating  what  secularists  would  see  as  a  caricature  of  reli  gion  and  of  science.   Karen  Armstrong  is  not  unsym  pathetic  to  fundamentalism,  con  sidered  a  rebellion  against  secular  ism.  The  two  sides  speak  different  languages  from  different  premises  and  will  never  agree.  Modernists  cannot  conceive  of  the  fear  and  anxiety  experienced  by  fundamen  talists,  who  see  themselves  and  their  God  as  threatened  by  a  secu  lar  society.   For  Jews  there  is  an  extra  dimen  sion  to  the  problem.  Some  see  the  establishment  of  the  State  of  Israel  as  a  blasphemy.  Israeli  writer  Amos  Oz  said  of  the  Gush  Emunim  settler  movement  that  it  has  “emerged  from  a  dark  corner  of  Judaism”.  According  to  Armstrong,  extremist   Meir  Kahane’s  Judaism  was  “so  reductionist  and  ruthlessly  selec  tive  that  it  became  a  deadly  carica  ture  of  faith”.  As  he  wrote,  “A  Jewish  fist  in  the  face  of  an  aston  ished  Gentile  world  that  has  not  seen  it  for  two  millennia,  this  is  Kiddush  Hashem  [sanctification  of  the  Name  of  God]”.   Some  fundamentalist  groups  are  murderous  and  crazed.  The  plot  to  blow  up  the  Dome  of  the  Rock  was,  Armstrong  asserts,  calculated  to  start  an  apocalypse  for  which  God  would  be  “compelled”  to  send  the  Messiah.  Fundamentalists  have  justified  murder,  are  responsible  for  some  viciously  racist  utter  ances  and  are  in  every  way  scan  dalously  shameful  to  Judaism  and   Jews.   Fundamentalists  may  have  peaked  in  influence  in  all  faiths,  but   we  cannot  ignore  that  they  are  a  force  in  our  society,  the  more  sur  prising  when  many  assumed  that  we  were  moving  into  an  era  of  light  and  reason.  It  is  wrong  to  presume  that  they  are  always  old-fashioned  and  anachronistic.  Indeed,  funda  mentalists  have  mastered  many  modern  techniques,  and  although   they  affect  to  despise  the  secular  ,  world,  they  are  very  good  at  play  ing  its  political  games.   In  Israel  today,  two  tragic  con  tests  are  occurring:  Arabs  versus  Israelis,  and  Israelis  versus  Israelis.   In  comparing  the  three  creeds,  Armstrong  may  provide  more  than  a  busy  reader  may  want,  but  it  is  salutary  to  learn  that  others  share  our  troubles.  The  fatwa  against  writer  Salmon  Rushdie  is  a  good  example  of  the  clash  between  sec  ularism  and  fundamentalism  with  in  the  Muslim  fold.   The  last  lines  of  the  book  could   be  taken  to  heart  by  all:  “If  funda-  t  mentalists  must  evolve  a  more   compassionate  assessment  of  their  enemies  to  be  true  to  their  reli  gious  traditions,  secularists  must  also  be  more  faithful  to  the  benev  olence,  tolerance  and  respect  for  humanity  which  characterises  modern  culture  at  its  best,  and  address  themselves  more  emphati  cally  to  the  fears,  anxieties  and  needs  which  so  many  of  their  fun  damentalist  neighbours  experi  ence,  but  which  no  society  can  safely  ignore.”   Dr  Ben  Haneman  is  a  consultant  &gt;  physician  and  book  reviewer.

"  Pursuing  Muslim-Jewish  harmony   Danya  Levy   WAVERLEY  Coun  cil  has  established  a  working  party  to  bring  together  the  Jewish  and  Muslim  communities,  and  it  is  appealing  to  members  of  the  public  to  get  involved.   The  council  adopted  a  motion  by  Councillor  Sam   Einfeld  last  week  to  establish  a  Work  ing  Party  for  Com  munity  Harmony.   The  group  aims  to  bring  together  the  two  communi  ties  to  explore  ways  of  improving  the  relationship  between  them.   Councillor  Sam  Elnfeld   Aware  of  the  increase  in  tension  between  the  Palestinian  and  Jewish  communities  in  recent  months,  he  said  that  if  local  govern  ment  did  not  take  the  lead  in  fostering  com  munal  harmony,  immigrants  would  bring  notions  of  cultural  separatism  with  them.   Councillor  Einfeld  —  a  nephew  of  renowned  human  rights  campaigner  former  Justice  Marcus  Einfeld  —  chairs  the  coun  cil’s  Multicultural  Advisory  Committee.   Affirming  his  commitment  to  multicultur  al  Australia,  he  pointed  to  Sydney’s  diverse   population.  “Often  these  communities  are  in  conflict  overseas,  which  they  bring  here  in  their  feelings  and  cultures.   “We  need  to  show  immigrants  that  their  situation  has  changed  and  that  the  society   here  is  different.   “It  is  geared  towards  harmony  and  easing  racial  differences.”   The  working  party  will  not  concern  itself  with  delving  into  perceived  past  injustices,  he  emphasised.   “We  will  focus  on  the  future  relationship  between  the  communities  and  how  to  enhance  inter-community  understanding  and  respect.   “I  want  to  show  our  counterparts  over  seas  that  we  can  live  in  peace.  It’s  not  about  who  did  what,  it’s  about  being  a  shining  example  to  those  overseas.”   Waverley  Council  is  seeking  members  of  the  Jewish  and  Muslim  communities  to  join  the  working  party.   The  small  Muslim  presence  in  Waverley  means  the  council  will  look  further  afield  for  Muslim  representation.   While  the  working  party  is  aimed  at  improving  Muslim-Jewish  relations,  the  poli  cy  that  has  enabled  its  establishment  could  pave  the  way  for  future  such  groups.   “If  something  else  arose  within  communi  ties,  the  mayor  could  set  up  a  new  working  party  without  having  to  go  back  to  council,”   Councillor  Einfeld  added.   Members  of  the  Jewish  community  inter  ested  in  participating  in  the  working  party  should  email  Councillor  Einfeld  at  seinfeld@waverley.nsw.gov.au ",2002-06-07
  Muslim  rally   supports  terror   CAPE  TOWN  —  Muslims  in  Cape  Town  supported  Palestinian  terrorism  during  an  anti-Israel  rally.  The  demonstrators  marched  to  the  US  Consulate  and  called  on  the  United  States  to  withdraw  its  support  for  Israel  and  stop  its  “political  adventurism”  in  Afghanistan.  Marchers  shouted  “Death  to  Israel”  and  “Long  Live  Hamas”.  Three  children  dressed  as  suicide  bombers  held  wooden  machine-guns  that  bore  the  word   “Hezbollah”. ,2002-01-04
"  Jewish-Muslim  condemnation  of  suicide  bombing   Angie  Fox   MUTUAL  Muslim  and  Jewish  declarations  against  suicide  bombing  were  “major  accom  plishments”  of  the  inaugural  conference  of  the  Rabbinical  Council  of  the  Euro-Asian  Jewish  Congress,  held  in  Kazakhstan  recently.   Mizrachi  Rabbi  J  Simcha  Cohen  of  Melbourne  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  he  had  initiated  dialogue  on  the  issue  between  the  international  rabbis  and  senior  representa  tives  of  the  Muslim  leadership  at  the  confer   ence.   “I  said  I  was  willing  to  make  public  a  state  ment  that  Judaism  is  not  at  war  with  Islam  or  Muslims,”  he  said.   “Will  a  leader  of  the  Muslim  community  openly  make  such  a  statement  that  they  are  not  at  war  with  Judaism  and  the  Jews?   “Judaism  is  against  terror.  Suicide  bombings,  which  zero  in  on  innocent  civilians,  is  ghastly  and  against  everything  Judaism  stands  for.”   His  statements  were  initially  met  with  a  wall   of  silence.   But  the  following  evening,  when  the  dean  of  the  Islamic  University  of  Kazakhstan,  Murat-Haji   Rabbi  1  Simcha  Cohen   Mynbaev,  addressed  the  conference,  he  stunned  the  rabbis  by  issuing  the  following  dec   laration:   “Anyone  who  is  a  terrorist,  who  is  a  suicide  bomber,  cannot  be  called  a  Muslim,  is  not  a  reli  gious  person  and  is  definitely  in  violation  of  the   basic  tents  of  Islam.”   The  declaration  received  a  rousing  applause  from  the  40  rabbis  present.   Rabbi  Cohen  said  the  mutual  declarations  were  a  small  but  important  step  towards   mutual  tolerance.   “One  of  the  most  important  things  in  life  that  we  can  do  is  lower  the  level  of  enmity  and  increase  the  level  of  tolerance,”  he  emphasised.   Kazakhstani  President  Nursaltan  Nazzarbayev  told  the  conference  of  rabbis  —  who  came  from  more  than  a  dozen  countries,  including  France,  England  and  Israel  —  that  he  would  act  as  a  communication  channel  to  the  isolated  Iranian  Jewish  community  regarding  the  status  of  Jewish  prisoners  incarcerated  there,  as  well  as  missing  Israeli  airman  Ron   Arad.   The  delegation  also  lobbied  the  President  to  spearhead  a  gathering  of  world  Muslim  and  Jewish  leaders  in  Kazakhstan,  which  President  Nazzarbayev  said  is  willing  to  serve  as  a  bridge   between  Jews  and  Muslims.   Rabbi  Cohen  said  the  high  level  of  religious  tolerance  in  Kazakhstan,  as  well  as  the  coun  try’s  good  relations  with  Israel  and  other  Muslim  countries,  bodes  well  for  the  future.   “Maybe  from  this  country,  Kazakhstan,  will  come  a  new  peace,  a  dialogue.”   Kazakhstan’s  Jewish  community  president,  Alexander  Mashkevich,  48,  a  philanthropist  and  businessman,  funded  the  conference,  which  took  place  in  the  capital,  Astana,  as  well  as  in  the  town  of  Almaty,  where  the  grave  of  the  Late  Lubavitcher  Rebbe’s  father  is  located.   The  Euro-Asian  Jewish  Congress  was  established  in  March  this  year  in  response  to  burgeoning  Jewish  life  in  the  former  Soviet   countries.   It  comprises  delegates  from  28  nations  in  the  Far  East,  the  Pacific  region,  Australia  and  the  former  Soviet  Union.   Rabbi  Cohen,  who  also  visited  synagogues  and  met  with  members  of  Kazakhstan’s  Jewish  communities  —  estimated  at  some  where  between  7000  and  20,000  out  a  toted  population  of  15  million  —  said  Jewish  life  there  was  “becoming  vibrant”.   “It’s  like  a  return  to  Judaism,”  he  said.  “People  are  learning  as  much  as  they  can.”   H  Renaissance  in  the  Urals,  page  17 ",2002-12-06
"  News   Muslim  scholars  extol  suicide  bombers   Stefan  Bialoguski   SUICIDE  bombings  perpetrated  against  “Zionists”  have  been  lauded  as  “the  highest  form  of  martyrdom”  by  a  conference  of  Muslim  scholars  which  included  Australian  Muslim  leader  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hilaly.   The  Beirut  conference  of  50  religious  scholars  also  declared  that  “suicide  operations  against  the  Zionist  enemies  are  legitimate  and   based  on  the  Koran”.   The  participation  of  the  Grand  Mufti  of  Australia,  who  is  based  in  Lakemba,  was  confirmed  by  his  spokesman,  Lebanese  Muslim  Association  vice-president  Keysar   Trad.   On  January  14,  the  Australian  Arab  newspaper  El  Telegraph  quoted  Sheikh  Hilaly  as  saying  that  suicide  killings  were  legitimate,  and  those  who  rejected  them  were  not   authentic  Muslims.   The  Australian  reported  three  days  earlier  that  the  Beirut  conference  concluded  that  suicide  attacks  were  “a  strategic  weapon  which  has  restored  a  balance  of  power  with  the  enemy”,  adding  that  the  scholars  did  not  distinguish  between  civilian  or  military  targets.   The  scholars  also  lauded  the  terrorist  groups  Hamas,  Islamic  Jihad  and  Hezbollah,  saying  they  “defend  the  honour  of  Muslims”.   Australian  Muslim  leader  Sheikh  Tajeddln  al  Hllaly...  Quoted  as  saying  suicide   killings  were  legitimate,  and  those  who  rejected  them  were  not  authentic  Muslims.   Sheikh  Hilaly’s  comments  have  been  condemned  by  the  Jewish  community  and  implicitly  criticised  by  the  Federal  Government.   The  Federal  Opposition’s  spokesman  on  multicultural  affairs,   Laurie  Ferguson,  declined  to  do  the  same,  however.   The  left-wing  Labor  MP  voiced   concern  that  the  sheikh  should   brand  co-religionists  as  unauthentic  Muslims  if  they  did  not  support   suicide  bombings,  but  added:  “I  think  both  sides  in  this  struggle  become  somewhat  technical  about  the  killing  of  civilians.”   Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  Gary  Hardgrave:  “1  would  urge  anybody  who  travels  overseas  to  speak  at  a  conference  to  take  some  of  the  Australian  values  with  them.  Here,  we  talk  it  out,  we  don’t  fight  it  out.”   The  sheikh’s  involvement  in  a   conference  supporting  suicide  attacks  against  Israel  comes  despite  his  having  condemned  the  September  11  terrorist  attack  on  the  World  Trade  Centre.   SBS  Television  cited  that  denunciation  as  the  reason  for  its  decision  not  to  broadcast  a  sermon   which  Sheikh  Hilaly  gave  lauding  suicide  bombers  just  days  after  the  murder  of  15  Israelis  at  Jerusalem’s   Sbarro  pizza  restaurant  last  August.   Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  CEO  Amjad  Mehboob  said  Sheikh  Hilaly  had  condemned  terrorist  attacks  against  Israelis  as  recently  as  last  week.  But  Mr  Trad  declined  to  do  so  when  interviewed  by  the  Australian  Jewish  News.   “An  attack  on  innocent  people  is  never  justified,  and  [Sheikh  Hilaly]  holds  on  to  that  position  as  well,”  he  said.  “I  understand  that  he  didn’t   give  an  interview  to  El  Telegraph.  If  they  have  quoted  him,  they  have  taken  it  from  here  or  there,  and  he   doesn’t  hold  that  view.”   El  Telegraph's  Australian  Affairs  editor,  Ouday  Jouni,  told  the  AJN  that  Sheikh  Hilaly’s  comments  were  included  in  a  story  which  had  been  reprinted  from  the  Beirut  newspaper  Annahar.   Mr  Mehboob:  “I  have  asked   [Sheikh  Hilaly]  very  specific  questions  on  [suicide  attacks]  and  he  has  given  me  the  explicit  answer  that  he  doesn’t  exclude  Israel  [from  his  condemnation  of  such  attacks].  He  condemns  the  killing  of  people  in  the  restaurant  [Sbarro]  and  other  places.  You  can’t  pick  up  guns  and  shoot  willy-nilly  in  the  street,  and  he   doesn’t  condone  that.”   Mr  Mehboob  seemed  surprised  at  being  told  that  Sheikh  Hilaly  had  praised  suicide-bombers  within  days  of  the  Sbarro  atrocity.  “When  was  that?”  On  being  told  that  SBS  had  videotaped  the  remarks,  he  said:  “I  don’t  know  about  that.  I’m  not  aware  of  that  comment.”   Sheikh  Hilaly  first  attained  notoriety  for  an  antisemitic  speech  to  Muslims  at  the  University  of  Sydney  in  1988.   He  claimed  at  the  time  that  Jews   were  “the  underlying  cause  of  all  wars”,  had  a  “malicious  disposition  towards  all  mankind”  and  used  “sex  and  abominable  acts  of  buggery  to  control  the  world”.   Continued  page  36   Muslim  scholars  extol  suicide  bombers   Continued  from  page  3   Mr  Trad:  “My  view  is  that  there  is  far  too  much  bloodshed  in  the  Middle  East,  and  we  would  like  to  see  all  sides  come  together  and  find  peaceful  and  just  ways  to  resolve  the  conflict.  We  feel  the  best  way  is  to  explore  peaceful  avenues.  I  can’t  say  anything  more  than  that...  Suicide  attacks  per  se  we  don’t  support,  they  are  wrong.  But  in  the  context  of  the  Middle  East  conflict,  I  can’t  say  anything  more  than  I  have  already.”   He  stressed  that  he  would  never  endorse  suicide  attacks  and  would  “strongly  discour  age”  anyone  from  perpetrating  such  acts,  but  refused  to  contradict  the  statement  issued  by  the  Beirut  conference.   “I’m  not  in  their  league  of  scholarly  knowl  edge,  so  I  can’t  over-rule  them.  I’m  still  a  stu  dent.  I’m  not  qualified  to  condemn  these  peo  ple.  They  are  scholars  who  are  much  more  knowledgeable  about  the  issues  of  right  and  ""T/  wrong.”   Given  that  Islam,  like  Judaism,  condemns  both  murder  and  suicide,  Mr  Trad  was  asked  why  he  could  not  make  an  unequivocal  state  ment  condemning  suicide  attacks.   “In  terms  of  making  a  statement  that  may  inflame  the  situation  or  emotions  in  the  local   community,  we’re  not  likely  to  do  that,”  he  said.  “The  local  Muslim  community  is  extreme  ly  angered  with  the  public  perception  that  when  an  Israeli  is  murdered,  then  all  hell  breaks  loose  and  everybody  condemns  it.  But  no-one  does  that  when  it’s  a  Palestinian  civil  ian.”   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  presi  dent  Jeremy  Jones  condemned  Sheikh  Hilaly’s  reported  stance  and  SBS’s  refusal  to  reveal  it.   “Particularly  in  times  of  tension,  moral  lead  ership  is  essential.  All  terrorism  offends  against  basic  morality,  and  those  who  justify  suicide  bombings  show  the  greatest  possible  contempt  for  human  life  ...  It’s  difficult  to  com  prehend  whose  interests  are  served  that  the  pronouncements  of  a  person  of  the  promi  nence  of  Sheikh  Hilaly  are  in  any  way  con  cealed  from  the  Australian  public.”   But  Mr  Jones  cautioned  against  tarring  all   Muslims  with  the  same  brush.   “I  know  many  Muslims,  in  Australia  and  other  countries,  who  are  revolted  by  the  way  in  which  some  of  their  so-called  leaders  put  narrow  and  often  unjustifiable  political  agen  das  above  the  ideals  of  peace,  justice  and  human  beings  working  together  for  the  com  mon  good.” ",2002-02-01
"  Activist  urges  solidarity  with  abused  Muslim  women   Bernard  Freedman   ISRAEU-born  Avigail  Abarbanel   wants  all  Australian  women  to  wear  headscarves  next  Friday,  November  29,  to  express  support  for  Muslim  women  who  face  abuse  because  of  their  dress  and  religion,  and  the  war   on  terror.   And  she  wants  men  to  join  the  women  in  what  she  is  calling  National  Headscarf  Day.   “They  could  wear  some  form  of  Muslim  headdress,”  she  suggests.  “Perhaps  a  yarmulke  would  be  appro  priate.   “There  is  no  rally  to  attend,  no  petition  to  sign.  It’s  easy.  Dress  as  usual,  put  a  scarf  over  your  head  and  go  about  your  day.  Any  scarf  will  do.”   A  Canberra  psychotherapist,  Ms  Abarbanel,  38,  said:  “I  am  a  Jewish  woman,  a  former  Israeli  and  an  Australian  citizen.  With  my  back  ground,  I  cannot  sit  by  and  watch  while  Muslim  people,  women  in  par   ticular,  are  becoming  the  target  of   racism.   “The  traditional  dress  of  Muslim  women  has  made  them  a  target  for  racially  motivated  attacks,  which  have  been  given  legitimacy  by  the  ASIO  raids  on  Muslim  homes.”   Ms  Abarbanel  claimed  to  have  received  100  emails  a  day  responding  to  her  call  —  some  from  Jewish  peo  ple,  many  from  Muslims,  most  from  peace  activists.   She  disagreed  with  women  who  say  a  headscarf  is  anti-feminist.  “In  places  in  the  Middle  East  where  they  are  told  they  must  wear  it  —  that’s  oppressive.”   She  agreed  with  Malayasian  Prime  Minister  Dr  Mahatir  Mohamad  that  Muslim  women  in  Australia  were  not  safe.  “Of  course  they  aren’t.  They  are  spat  on.  That’s  what  prompted  me  to  start  the  whole  thing.”   Ms  Abarbanel’s  father  was  bom  in  Israel  in  1937  to  Turkish-Greek  par  ents.  Her  mother,  a  Holocaust  sur   vivor,  migrated  to  Israel  from   Romania  in  1984.   Ms  Abarbanel  went  to  Bar-IIan  University,  where  she  did  religious  studies,  and  served  with  the  Israeli  Army  in  Lebanon.   Disillusioned,  she  moved  to  Australia  11  years  ago,  renouncing  her  Israeli  citizenship  18  months  ago.   “My  mother  grew  up  in  the  shad  ow  of  the  Holocaust  and  I  grew  up  in  the  shadow  of  the  persecution  of  the  Palestinian  people,”  she  said  in  a  speech  to  a  Hiroshima  Day  forum  recently.   She  is  aware  that  her  stance  will  upset  members  of  the  community  —  but  “it’s  not  easy  to  silence  me  by  calling  me  an  antisemite  when  I  ques  tion  what  Israel  does”,  she  declared.   As  president  of  the  Australian  National  Network  of  Counsellors  and  a  psychotherapist,  she  believes  Israelis  need  healing  from  the  trauma  of  their  persecution  before  they  can  come  to  terms  with  their  treatment  of   Palestinians.   She  could  not  do  this  in  Israel  because  she  was  too  traumatised.  “I  felt  suffocated.

"  Rothman  justifies  joint  Jewish-Muslim  statement   AT  THE  BOARD   Danya  Levy   THE  joint  Jewish  and  Islamic  peace  statement  by  local  community  members  was  a  “judgment”  call,  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman  told  this  month’s  plenum.   There  has  been  criticism  from  members  of  the  Jewish  community  about  the  statement,  signed  by  Great  Synagogue  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple,  Australian  Mufti  Tajeddin  al  Hilaly,  Muslims  Association  vice  president  Keysar  Trad  and  Mr   Rothman.   Critics  alleged  that  the  state  ment  made  a  moral  equivalence  between  the  actions  of  Palestinian  suicide  bombers  and  IDF  self  defence.  But  Mr  Rothman  told  the  meeting,  “There  could  be  no  com  parison  made  between  the  two.”   There  has  also  been  objection  to  Sheikh  Hilaly  being  a  signatory  on  the  statement  because  of  his  histo  ry  of  anti-Israel  comments.   “It  was  a  judgment  call  by  which  1  and  the  board  stand,  notwith  standing  Hilaly  and  his  position  in  the  Islamic  community.  As  we  saw  it  the  advantages  outweighed  the   disadvantages.  The  statement  con  doned  violence  towards  the  Jewish  community  and  called  on  members  of  the  Islamic  community  not  to  let  it  happen.”   There  are  “misgivings”  with  any  statement  of  this  nature,  Mr  Roth  man  said.   Board  vs.  the  media   BIASED  news  reports  on  the  cur  rent  Middle  East  conflict  are  being  compiled  by  the  Board  to  provide  it  with  grounding  to  approach  media  organisations,  the  Public  Relations  Committee  has  reported.   There  has  been  “significant”  reporting  recently  on  Israel,  com  mittee  chairman  Daniel  Hoenig  told  the  Board.  “Some  has  been  posi  tive,  some  particularly  negative  and  some  has  actually  achieved  a  bal   ance.”   The  committee  regularly  meets  with  members  of  the  media  and  would  continue  to  do  so.  Informing  the  Jewish  community  about  Israel  is  important  and  should  be  a  focus  of  the  Board,  he  said.  “We  need  to  get  the  message  across  through  any  avenue  and  we  want  to  assist  people  to  do  that.”   Commemoration  congratulations   YOM  Hashoah  may  only  have  been  two  weeks  ago,  but  planning  for  next  year’s  commemoration  events  is  already  underway,  Shoah  Committee  chairman  David  Knoll  told  the  Board.  Participa  tion  in  the  14  functions  held  this  year  had  been  high,  he  said.  “It’s  time  to  say  a  tremendous  thanks  to  the  Jewish  community.”   The  Board  has  already  received  a  number  of  phone  calls  from  members  of  the  community  with  ideas  for  next  year’s  com  memorations,  particularly  from  school  captains.

"  Muslim  radio  station  wins  Holocaust  denial  case  in  South  Africa   Michael  Belling   CAPE  TOWN  —  Jewish  leaders  have  reacted  with  dismay  after  their  com  plaint  that  a  Muslim  radio  station  had  trivialised  the  Holocaust  was  rejected.   In  an  acrimonious  case,  the  South  African  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  had  filed  the  complaint  with  the  nation’s  Broadcasting  Complaints  Commission  about  a  1998  broadcast  on  Radio  786,  a  Muslim  station  in  Cape  Town.   During  the  broadcast,  Yacoub  Zaki,  a  historian  at  the  Muslim  Institute  in  London,  said:  “I  accept  that  one-million-plus  Jews  died  dur  ing  World  War  II,  but  I  dispute  the  fact  that  they  were  murdered,  that  they  were  killed  by  gassing.   “These  people  died,  like  other  people  in  the  camps,  from  infectious  diseases,  particularly  typhus.”   The  interview  prompted  a  series  of  legal  actions,  including  one  brought  before  the  Constitutional  Court,  the  nation’s  highest  court.   In  that  case,  the  radio  station  sought  to  overturn  a  section  of  the  broadcasters’  code  of  conduct  that  prohibits  hate  speech.   Radio  786  brought  the  case  after  the  board  of  deputies  had  lodged  a  complaint  against  the  station  for  air  ing  the  program,  which  dealt  with   the  ideology  of  Zionism  and  how  it  resulted  in  the  creation  of  the  Jewish  State.   Earlier  this  year,  the  Constitutional  Court  sided  with  the  radio  station  and  struck  down  sever   al  provisions  of  the  Broadcasting  Code  of  Conduct  as  unconstitutional  infringements  on  the  right  of  free  speech.   “Denying  ortrivialisingthe  Holocaust  was  an  attack  on   the  dignity  of  the  Jewish   people  and  not  just  churlish   behaviour.""   South  African  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies   After  that  ruling,  the  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  turned  to  the  Broadcasting  Complaints  Com  mission,  as  it  had  done  previously,  in  the  hope  of  obtaining  a  ruling  against  the  radio  station.  Now  those  hopes  have  been  dashed.   In  his  ruling  dismissing  the  com  plaint,  commission  official  Roland  Sutherland  wrote:  “The  trivialising  of  the  extent  of  the  suffering  of  Jews  during  World  War  II  is  doubtless  per  ceived  by  many  who  accept  the   accuracy  of  Holocaust  evidence  as  churlish  and  insulting.   “Nevertheless,  in  my  view,  it  is  not  the  stuff  of  which  reasonable  people  take  offence  to  the  degree  it  warrants  the  proscription  of  the  expression  of  such  views.”   Hate  speech  is  not  protected  under  the  free  speech  provisions  of  the  South  African  constitution,  but  Sutherland  ruled  that  the  broadcast  did  not  fall  under  the  category  of  hate  speech.   Sutherland  found  there  was  “no  attack  in  the  broadcast  on  the  Jewish  religion  or  Jews  as  such”.   He  also  ruled  that  the  broadcast  had  included  “no  exhortation  to  hatred  of  any  particular  religious  group  or  group  of  individuals”.   The  board  of  deputies  subse  quently  issued  a  statement  saying  the  ruling  evoked  “a  deep  sense  of   shock”.   “Denying  or  trivialising  the  Holocaust  was  an  attack  on  the  dig  nity  of  the  Jewish  people  and  not  just  churlish  behaviour,”  the  state   ment  said.   Board  of  deputies’  national  chair  man  Russell  Gaddin  said  they  would  pursue  the  matter  further.  “We  believe  we  have  a  case  they  have  to   answer.   JTA ",2002-11-22
"  n   Letters   J   m  TIIE  AUSTRALIAN^  ■  |||^  g|   Jewish  News   Jewish-Muslim  program  a  commendable  initiative   IHE  decision  by  Mount  Scopus  College  to  invite  12  Muslim  students  to  its  campus  on  an  exchange  program  is  to  be  highly  commended.  A  In  this  post-September  11  climate  of  fear  and  intolerance  —  cloud  ed  by  looming  war  in  Iraq  and  the  threat  of  terror  spilling  over  from  the  Bali  atrocity,  such  an  initiative  speaks  of  foresight  and  courage.   It  would  have  been  an  easy  option  to  quietly  defer  such  a  venture  —  or  even  cancel  it.  Now  is  not  the  time,  many  would  argue,  to  invite  Mus  lim  youth  to  a  Jewish  dayschool.   In  fact,  the  reverse  could  hardly  be  more  relevant  —  particularly  now,  when  Muslims  are  tarred  by  a  broad  brush  of  intolerance,  when  stereo  types  of  Muslims  as  unpatriotic  and  worthy  of  suspicion  are  common  place.   Now  more  than  ever,  it  is  essential  that  Jewish  students  engage  in  dia  logue  with  other  cultures,  especially  Muslims,  and  learn  first-hand  that  they  too  are  a  minority  trying  to  make  their  way  as  law-abiding  Australian   citizens.   The  response  of  the  students,  both  Jewish  and  Muslim,  to  the  exercise  is  anecdotal  proof  that  this  initiative,  believed  to  be  a  landmark  for  an  Australian  Jewish  dayschool,  has  overwhelming  importance.   The  discussions  which  the  students  held  were  largely  superficial,  and  in  the  limited  time  available  barely  scratched  the  surface.  The  Middle  East  conflict  was  pointedly  avoided.   But  the  aim  of  the  program  should  be  that  in  due  course,  having  estab  lished  a  relationship  based  on  mutual  recognition  and  trust,  the  students  will  break  down  the  barriers  that  separate  them  and  be  able  to  discuss  even  such  vexed  issues  as  the  Middle  East  in  an  atmosphere  of  respect.   The  criticism  is  sometimes  heard  that  the  dayschool  system  shelters  students  from  the  melting-pot  of  cultures  which  comprise  modem  Aus   tralia.   Indeed,  just  as  non-Jewish  students  are  encouraged  to  visit  the  Syd  ney  Jewish  Museum,  it  should  be  built  into  the  dayschool  curriculum  that  students  interact  with  counterparts  from  other  cultures  in  a  bid  to  dispel  myths  and  crush  preconceptions.   Mount  Scopus  Rabbi  Ralph  Genende  cited  the  olive  tree  as  a  metaphor  for  the  fledgling  Jewish-Muslim  relationship  which  has  been  established  by  the  Melbourne  students.  Indeed,  it  is  a  tender  relationship  which  will  require  careful  nurturing.   But  one  olive  tree  does  not  a  forest  make.  Mount  Scopus  is  to  be  com  mended  for  its  initiative,  but  it  should  be  just  a  beginning.  The  college  should  now  take  the  bold  step  of  integrating  the  study  of  Islam  into  its  curriculum  —  and  the  other  Jewish  dayschools  should  follow  suit.   Furthermore,  the  major  community  organisations  should  take  Mount  Scopus’  lead  and  also  reach  out  and  set  up  dialogue  forums  with  their  Muslim  counterparts. ",2002-11-15

Six  Australian  Federal  Police  officers  raided  Roche’s  Perth  flat  for  a  second  time  last  week,  the  day  before  Roche  was  to  appear  in  the  Perth  Magistrate’s  Court.   They  seized  a  computer,  papers  and  telephone  numbers.   These  were  in  addition  to  about  10  boxes  which  police  removed  before  Roche  was  arrested  on  November  18.   Roche  has  indicated  that  he  will  plead  not  guilty  to  two  charges  of  conspiring  with  oth  ers  in  Malaysia,  Pakistan  and  Afghanistan,  between  February  15  and  May  26,2000,  to  damage,  by  fire  or  explosives,  diplomatic  property  in  Australia,  and,  as  a  consequence,  to  harm  diplo  matic  staff.   The  charges  carry  a  maxi  mum  penalty  of  15  years  for  plot  ting  to  damage  property  and  45  years  for  conspiring  to  harm  diplomatic  staff.   Lawyer  Robert  Mazza  did  not  apply  for  bail  on  Roche’s  behalf.   He  said  neither  Roche  nor  his  associates  had  the  means  to  guarantee  bail  which  could  be  as  high  as  $100,000.   A  man  whom  police  identified  as  Jemah  Amir  sobbed  when  Roche  appeared  in  court.  There  was  no  reaction  from  Roche  when  guards  removed  the  man.   Roche,  who  is  being  held  in  protective  custody  since  receiv  ing  death  threats  from  fellow  inmates,  was  remanded  to  reappear  on  December  11. ",2002-12-06

"  is   THE  Mount  Scopus  College  Jewish  Muslim  exchange  program  is  a  heart-warming  gesture  (AJN  15/11/02).

University  of  NSW  and  Sydney  University  comparative  religions  lecturer  Ruth  Lewin   led  the  forum.   “When  social  structures  break  down,  women  are  the  first  victims,”  she  told  the  convention.  “Social  structures  might  imprison  us  in  roles  and  positions  that  are  no  longer  valued  for  how  we  see  each  other  in  the  21st  century.”   Accepted  thinking  was  changing  and  now  depicted  religion  as  more  biological  than  cultural,  she  said.  “This  is  because  we  can  not  find  any  people  with  no  religion.”   Advances  in  women’s  rights  is  often  slow,  Peg  McEntee  of  the  Catholic  Women’s  League  said.  “We  want  everything  to  happen   at  once.”   Last  year  women  from  every  diocese  in  Australia  were  given  the  opportunity  to  make  a  statement  to  the  Catholic  Church  and  the  womens’  submissions  led  to  the  for  mation  of  the  Commission  of  Catholic  Women.   For  the  past  10  years  Muslim  and  Jewish  women  in  Sydney  have  been  communicating  after  communal  representatives  participat  ed  in  interfaith  dialogue  set  up  by  the  Uni  versity  of  Sydney.   Muslim  and  Jewish  women  worked   together  with  the  Family  Law  Court  last  year  on  an  understanding  of  women’s  religious  marriage  rights,  Jamila  Hussain  of  Sydney’s  University  of  Technology  explained.   “Consent  to  marry  is  essential  in  Islamic  law.  However,  there  are  a  number  of  igno  rant  men  still  following  cultural  laws.  They  are  the  people  forcing  their  daughters  to  marry.  The  right  to  divorce  has  always  been  there.”   Often  ignorance  is  the  biggest  problem  between  interfaith  relations,  she  said.  “We   need  to  help  others  to  understand  our  reli  gions.  We  need  to  exchange  ideas  and  work  together  on  prominent  issues.”   The  three  religions  have  a  lot  of  common  interests,”  Ms  Hussain  said.  “It’s  silly  for  three  people  to  do  the  same  thing  independ  ently  when  they  can  work  together  and  get  a  better  result.”   The  Koran  says  heaven  is  under  the  feet  of  mothers,  Wafa  Zaim  of  the  Muslim  Women’s  Association  said.  “She  is  moving  the  world  in  her  hand.”   Religion  is  often  confused  with  culture,  she  said,  citing  the  example  of  arranged  mar  riages,  which  is  a  cultural  matter,  not  an   issue  of  Islamic  law.   Wafa  Za!m  of  the  Muslim  Women's  Association,  convention  co-convenor  Miriam  Stein,  Jamlia  Hussain  of  Sydney’s  University  of  Technology.   The  association  works  with  schools  and  families  to  educate  both  students  and  teach  ers  about  women’s  rights.  “We  don’t  defend  people  culturally  -  we  don’t  defend  the  Lebanese,  Turkish  or  Egyptian  cultures.”   Women  have  a  substantial  role  to  play  in  interfaith  dialogue,  Rebbetzin  Leah  Berger  of  Chabad  Double  Bay  said.  “In  the  Torah  it  says  that  women  have  the  higher  form  of  understanding.  Everyone  has  a  different  make  up.  Physically  our  make-up  is  different  to  men’s  and  it’s  the  same  with  our  spiritual  make-up.”   Human  beings  are  more  important  than  rules  or  dogma,  Sydney  University  religion  department  associate  Dr  Colette  Rayment   said.   “Who  leads  religious  services  is  half  as  important  as  the  esoteric  values  of  religion.  If  we  get  into  the  esoterics  of  faith,  we  will  find  so  much  more  to  enrich  us  than  who  does  what.”   If  women  can  overcome  their  own  preju  dice,  they  will  take  a  huge  step  towards  changing  the  world,  she  said.  “If  we  as  women  go  about  condemning  divorced  women,  we  are  joining  the  male  hierarchy.  Embrace  women  who  dare  to  break  the  rules.”   All  three  religions  believe  women  have  a  role  in  creating  and  caring  for  the  universe,  independent  scholar  and  Reform  movement  teacher  Michelle  Stein-Evers  said.  “But  we   live  in  a  religious  society  which  says  some  thing  different.  It  says  that  if  you  don’t  have  that  chromosome  you  can’t  speak  from  a  pul  pit  or  give  a  dvar  Torah  if  you  are  in  a  mixed  company.  That  is  the  struggle  we  all  face.”   The  Progrerssive  tradition  is  just  as  opposed  to  change  in  some  quarters  as  the  Orthodox,  she  said.  “There  are  crazy  people  in  every  tradition.  Women  talk  to  each  other  and  find  out  whom  to  avoid.  We  must  remember  to  talk  to  each  other.”   There  is  much  to  learn  from  each  other,  Ms  Zaim  summarised.  “If  we  can  always  keep  our  mind  and  hearts  open  to  each  other,  we  can  listen,  respect  and  understand  each   other.” ",2002-05-31
"  Headscarf  Day  organiser  abused  for  her  views   Avigail  Abarbane!...  conceived  National  Headscarf  Day.   Bernard  Freedman   FORMER  Israeli  Avigail  Abarbanel  has  received  abuse  and  threats  for  sug  gesting  that  Australians  should  sup  port  threatened  Muslim  women  by  wearing  headscarves  on  Friday,  and  for  making  controversial  statements  about  Jewish  festivals  and  Israeli  treatment  of  Palestinians.   Ms  Abarbanel,  38,  a  Canberra  psy  chotherapist  who  was  bom  in  Israel  and  served  in  the  Israeli  Army,  called  for  police  help  after  receiving  abusive  faxes,  calls  and  emails  which  she  believes  came  from  angry  Jewish  readers  after  the  Australian  Jewish  News  published  her  views  last  week.   On  Sunday  a  man  from  Melbourne  telephoned  at  11.45pm  screaming  “Nazi,  Nazi,  Nazi.  I  wish  you  would  end  up  like  Hitler.”   “I  know  the  number,”  she  said.  “I   also  know  the  telephone,  fax  num  bers  and  emails  of  the  other  callers.  I  rang  the  police.  They  said  wait  and  see  what  happens.   “I  could  file  a  complaint  of  harass  ment,  but  I  don’t  want  to  punish  peo  ple.  I  feel  sorry  for  them.  I  understand  they  are  hurting.  They  can  tell  me  and  I’ll  listen.  I’m  a  counsellor,  after  all.   “But  I  don’t  expect  harassment.  They  have  no  right  to  use  me  as  a  punehing-bag.   “I  am  not  a  Jew-hater.  These  are  my  people.  My  mother  is  the  daugh  ter  of  Holocaust  survivors.  My  grand  mother  lost  two  babies  in  a  forced  labour  camp  in  Romania.  My  mother  and  family  were  sent  to  a  detention  camp  in  Cyprus  when  they  tried  to  reach  Israel  as  refugees.”   The  AJN  has  sighted  three  unsigned  faxes,  one  from  Melbourne  and  two  from  Sydney.   The  Melbourne  tax  said  Moslem   activist  Avigail  Abarbanel  is  being  investigated  if  she  has  broken  any  laws  due  to  her  anti-Jewish  state  ments.  Lawyers  are  working  on  this  case!  If  a  case  is  strong  enough,  we  will  make  sure  she  is  dealt  with  by  the  full  strength  of  the  courts.”   “It  was  an  attempt  to  intimidate  me,”  Ms  Abarbanel  said.  “I  am  enti  tled  to  express  my  opinion,  especially  in  a  Jewish  newspaper.  I  was  not  talk  ing  to  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald.”   Two  faxes  from  Sydney  attacked  her  remark  that  most  Jewish  festivals  “celebrate  victory,  vengeance  and  retribution”.  One  said  her  comments  were  “fantasy  to  stir  up  hatred”.   She  said  she  received  “hundreds  of  supportive  emails”  about  her  cam  paign  urging  women  to  wear  scarves.  About  one  in  20  responses  opposed  what  she  was  doing,  she  said. ",2002-11-29
"  Jews.  Christians.  Muslims  unite   Alton  Lee   THE  peak  national  representative  bodies  of  the  Australian  Jewish,  Muslim  and  Christian  communities  have  issued  a  joint  statement  encouraging  dialogue  as  “the  way  to  peace”  and  mutual  respect  between  religions  both  locally  and  in  the   Middle  East.   The  statement  also  condemns  “any  form  of  violence  arising  in  Australia  on  account  of  the  emotions   engendered  by  the  conflict  in  the  Middle  East,  including  expressions  of  racism  and  acts  of  vandalism  on  places  of  worship”.   Called  “A  time  for  peace”,  the  statement  is  endorsed  by  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  (ECAJ),  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils   (AFIC)  and  the  National  Council  of  Churches  in  Australia  (NCCA).  Co  signatories  to  the  statement  include  ECAJ  president  Jeremy  jones,  AFIC  chief  executive  officer  Amjad  Ali  Mehboob,  and  NCCA  representa   tives  Archbishops  Peter  Carnley,  Paul  Saliba,  Aghan  Baliozian,  Francis  Carroll  and  Reverend  Zeki  Zitoun  of  the  Syrian  Orthodox  Church.   “No-one  in  Australia  should   be  targeted  because   of  race,  creed  or  colour   and  there  should   certainly  be  no  attacks  on  places  of  worship.”   Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  CEO,   Amjad  All  Mehboob   ECAJ  president  Jeremy  Jones  described  the  statement  as  a  signifi  cant  document  that  reaffirms  the  “undeniable  and  incredible”  reser   voir  of  goodwill  in  Australia  from  people  of  different  backgrounds  to  live  in  peace  and  harmony.   “The  spirit  of  this  statement  is  one  of  compromise  and  doesn’t   make  any  moral  equivalence.  This  is  about  reaffirming  moral  principles.   “We  are  conscious  that  without  a  positive  affirmation  by  representa  tive  bodies  the  situation  can  give  a  free  run  to  people  who  want  to  poi  son  the  goodwill  that  exists  here,  “   Mr  Jones  said.   Of  particular  significance  was  the  involvement  of  AFIC,  which  Mr  Jones  described  as  “the  Islamic  represen  tative  body,  which  works  in  parallel  with  ECAJ  and  NCCA”.   AFIC  chief  executive  officer  Amjad  Ali  Mehboob  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  a  lot  of  problems  between  Australians  were  due  to  “ignorance”  and  “misunder  standings”  which  could  be  dispelled  by  building  better  relations.   “People  don’t  know  each  other  well  enough.  With  better  communi  cation  and  free  from  inhibitions  we  should  be  able  to  talk  like  adults.  It  is  in  this  context  that  we  call  upon  our  communities  to  work  together  and  live  together.”   Mr  Mehboob  said  it  was  impor  tant  that  a  distinction  was  made  in  communities  between  actions  that  offend  and  the  individuals  involved.  “No-one  in  Australia  should  be  tar  geted  because  of  race,  creed  or  colour  and  there  should  certainly  be  no  attacks  on  places  of  worship.”   The  declaration  follows  the  recent  joint  Jewish  and  Arab  state  ment  which,  though  it  called  for  negotiations  and  peace  in  the  Middle  East,  created  controversy  over  its  alleged  moral  equivalence  between  Palestinian  suicide  bombers  and  the  IDF’s  right  to  self-defence.  That  state  ment  was  signed  by  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman,  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  and  Sheikh  Tajedin  al  Hilaly,  well  known  for  his  anti-Israel  rhetoric.   The  NSW  Rabbincal  Council  dis  tanced  itself  from  the  previous  state  ment  and  ECAJ  president  Jeremy  Jones  and  ZFA  president  Ron  Weiser  had  refused  to  comment.   Mr  Rothman  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  it  was  encouraging  that  more  Arab  and  Muslim  bodies   and  figures  were  espousing  the  need  for  tolerance  and  dialogue.   NCCA  acting  general-secretary  Caesar  D’Mello  said  his  organisation  believed  it  was  imperative  to  act  because  of  the  situation  in  the  Middle  East.  “We  were  concerned  to  read  of  eight  Jewish  synagogues  being  spray  painted  with  graffiti.  Nothing  that  occurs  in  the  Middle  East  should  impact  negatively  on  communal  harmony  here,”  he  said.   OPINION:  Sheikh  Hilaly  and  the   peace  statement  —  page  17 ",2002-04-19
"  Martyrs  and  virgins   I  read  the  little  mock  article  that  was  posted  on  your  website  titled  ""Heaven  short  of  virgins  after  influx  of  Muslim  martyrs""  and  all  I  can  say  is  that  I'm  incensed  by   your  bigotry.  Apparently,  it  seems  Western  values  such  as  tolerance  and  understanding  has  yet  to  reach  Australia,  or  maybe  its  just  you.  The  article,  although  brief,  managed  to  accomplish  the  following:  1.  It  linked  Islam  with  terrorism  and  implied  that  terrorism  is  religiously  justified  within  Islamic  Theology.  2.  It  insulted  the  values  and  beliefs  of  a  fifth  of  the  world  by  misconstruing  and  mocking  various  beliefs  of  Islam.  3.  It  trivializes  the  deaths  of  innocent  civilians  who  are  suffering  in  Afghanistan  and  who  have  absolutely  nothing  to  do  with  September  11th  or  any  other  act  of  terror.  4.  Finally,  it  only  widens  the  perceived  chasm  between  the  West  and  Islam,  thus  impeding  inter-religious  and  inter-  civilizational  dialogue  by  fortifying  stereotypes  and  misrepresentations  in  the  minds  of  your  readers.  In  the  end,  the  article  did  nothing  to  add  to  the  debate  on  Afghanistan,  Islam,  the  West,  and  terrorism  except  to  reinforce  stereotypes  that  will  only   complicate  matters.  Satire  is  supposed  to  mock  the  status  quo  and  bring  about  intelligent  discussion.  Your  article  did  neither  and  is  an  insult  to  both  satire  and  to  Western  values  which  I'm  sure  you  claim  to  ascribe  to.  Your  Friend  and  Mine  Bisher  Tarabishy ",2002-01-25
"  Across  the  lines   RUTH  Hurwitz  never  would  have  guessed  that  her  Jewish  philanthropic  work  would  lead  her  to  sup  port  a  Muslim  student.   That  is,  until  she  met  Fitore  Jaha.   Due  to  the  generosity  of  Mrs  Hurwitz  of  Baltimore,  Ms  Jaha,  a  22-year-old  refugee  from  war-torn  Kosovo,  now  has  a  bright  future  to  look  forward  to  in  Israel.   Mrs  Hurwitz  is  providing  a  full  scholarship  to  the  Hadassah  College  of  Technology  for  Ms  Jaha  to  continue  her  studies  in  computer  science.   Mrs  Hurwitz  has  been  a  Hadassah  member,  sup  porter  and  volunteer  for  more  than  40  years.   She  was  president  of  the  Baltimore  chapter  from  1972-75,  and  has  served  on  the  national  board  of  the  organisation  since  1985.   “She  saw  an  opportunity  to  educate  a  young  woman,  and  she  made  certain  it  happened,”  said  Bonnie  Lipton,  Hadassah  national  president.   Ms  Jaha  is  an  Albanian-Muslim  with  a  family  his  tory  uniquely  intertwined  with  the  Jewish  people.   Her  maternal  grandparents,  Dervis  and  Servet  Korkut,  both  Muslim,  risked  their  lives  to  save  Jews  in  Sarajevo  during  World  War  II.   They  also  rescued  the  precious  and  renowned  14th-century  Sarajevo  Haggadah.

Lyndall  Katz,  46,  resource  worker:  Muslim  women  are   visible  targets.  This  is  a  great  way  for  Jewish  women  to  stand  beside  them,  given  that  we  know  what  it’s  like  to  be  targets.   Alla  Pilman,  41,  research  officer:  Why  doesn’t  she  identify  with  Jewish  mothers  who  have  lost  chil  dren?  Why  just  Muslim  women?  Support  should  be  given  to  both.   Ruth  Gardos,  72,  retired:  I  don’t  want  innocent  Muslim  women  to  be  harassed,  but  1  would  n’t  go  so  far  as  to  wear  a  headscarf  for  their  cause,  as  much  as  1  sympathise.   Dana  Dusheiko,  26,  young  adult  coordi  nator:  We  should  sup  port  any  people  experiencing  discrimi  nation,  but  I  wouldn’t  cover  my  head  because  I  don’t  nor  mally.  It’s  a  gimmick.   Anna  Berger,  50  something,  consult  ant:  Jewish  men  and  women  have  been  harassed  and  Ms  Abarbanel  was  silent.  I  prefer  less  hypocrisy  and  the  right  of  every  one  to  live  in  peace.   Beate  Strieker,  72,  retired:  My  sympathy  is  with  women  who  have  been  harassed.  It  doesn’t  hurt  to  wear  a  scarf  in  sympathy,  but  there  are  practical  ways,  like  educating  the  community.   Stephanie  Lenn,  26,  parliamentary  advis  er;  It’s  a  great  idea  to  show  how  inclusive  Australia  is  and  to  show  solidarity  with   the  Muslim  communi   ty,  which  is  suffering   discrimination.   Davina  Chiert,  25,  IT/human  resources:  It’s  a  good  idea  because  it  represents  unity  with  women  who  are  being  abused.

"  International   Muslims,  Jews  unite  against  Le  Pen   PARIS  —  The  Muslim  and  Jewish  communities  displayed  rare  unity  this  week  when  the  Mufti  of  Marseilles  took  the  stage  in  front  of  15,000  Jews  at  a  rally  in  Paris.   Soheib  Bencheikh,  Mufti  of  Marseilles,  announced:  “I  came  here  today  because  this  is  a  very  power  ful  moment  for  our  Jewish  brothers,  and  because  the  French  Jew  plays   the  role  of  a  barometer  for  the  Muslim,  and  if  the  Jew  of  France  is  worried,  Muslims  should  panic!”   Cosponsored  by  France’s  largest  Jewish  student  union,  the  UEJF,  and  one  of  the  nation’s  oldest  and  most   militant  anti-racist  organisations,  the  League  Against  Racism  and  Antisemitism,  the  demonstration  showed  that  French  Jews  are  no   longer  alone  in  their  struggle  against   racism  and  antisemitism.   Taking  the  podium  in  front  of  a  sea  of  French  flags  and  anti-Jean  Marie  Le  Pen  signs,  each  speaker  elicited  rousing  applause  with  exhor  tations  to  fight  Le  Pen  and  cast  their  votes  for  incumbent  Jacques  Chirac  on  Sunday.   Minutes  after  the  Mufti  spoke,  Gilles  Bemheim,  Rabbi  of  one  of  the  largest  congregations  in  France,  brought  another  explosion  of  applause.   “I  want  to  tell  my  friend,  the  Mufti  of  Marseilles,  that  Jews  who,  for  many  generations,  have  made  efforts  to  integrate  in  the  republic  and  to  respect  the  values  of  the  country  that  welcomed  us,  will  always  be  on  the  side  of  our  Muslim  brothers  who   are  respectful  of  the  values  of  the  French  republic.”   Not  all  French  Jews  are  opposed  to  extremist  right-winger  Jean-Marie  Le  Pen,  however.   Despite  overwhelming  Jewish  condemnation  of  the  presidential  candidate,  the  issue  has  provoked   controversy  among  some  French   Jewish  leaders.   This  week,  the  French  daily  Le  Monde  reported  that  Roger  Cukierman,  the  president  of  CRIF  —  the  umbrella  organisation  for  secu  lar  Jewish  institutions  in  France  —  told  the  Israeli  daily  Ha  ’aretz  that  Le  Pen’s  success  would  help  reduce  Arab  antisemitism.   Le  Pen’s  surprise  second-place  finish  in  first-round  voting  on  April  21  constituted  “a  message  to  the  Muslims  to  stay  quiet”,  Cukierman  allegedly  said.   “The  French  Jew  plays  the  role  of  a  barometer  for  the  Muslim,  and  if  the  Jew  of  France  is  worried,  Muslims   should  panic!”   Sohelb  Bencheikh,  Mufti  of  Marseilles   Cukierman  later  said  he  had  been  misquoted  when  his  words  were  translated  into  English,  but  several  Jewish  leaders,  including  CRIF  board  members,  were  quick  to  criticise  him.   “Such  statements  can  only  spread  discord  between  the  commu  nities,”  Rabbi  Daniel  Fahri,  president  of  the  Liberal  Jewish  Movement  of  France,  told  Le  Monde.   “Faced  with”  Le  Pen,  he  added,  “Jews  and  Muslims  are  in  the  same  boat.”   The  emergence  of  such  solidarity  should  not  be  overlooked  in  a  coun   try  that  in  the  past  18  months  has  seen  more  than  500  anti-Jewish  inci  dents,  many  of  them  committed  by  young  Muslims  of  North  African  descent  who  sympathise  with  the   Palestinian  cause.

Photo:  Andrew  Diamond/JTA   In  perhaps  the  ultimate  irony  of  the  election,  a  hate-mongering  leader  appears  to  have  contributed  to  a  heal  ing  process  in  neighbourhoods  where  Jews  and  Muslims  live  side  by  side.   Since  the  rise  of  Le  Pen,  the  fre  quency  and  intensity  of  anti-Jewish  incidents  have  ebbed  considerably.  Two  reported  incidents  last  week  —  the  stoning  of  a  school  bus  and  an  arson  attack  on  a  storage  facility  of  a  Jewish  school,  both  in  Paris  suburbs  —  represent  a  substantial  change  from  the  weeks  before  the  first   round  of  the  elections,  when  arson  attacks  and  physical  assaults  were  near-daily  occurrences.   Then  again,  the  extra  police  protection  provided  by  the  French  Government  also  may  have  played   a  role.   It  is  too  soon  to  tell  how  long  the  relative  peace  will  endure.  What  seems  more  certain  is  that  Le  Pen’s  success  has  awakened  many  French  citizens  to  the  threats  that  such  religious  violence  poses  to   the  country.   JTA ",2002-05-03
"  A  shame   IT’S  a  shame  that  Temple  Emanuel  can’t  do  anything  more  constructive  for  the  community  than  hold  a  forum  with  two  Muslim  speakers  talking  about  the  plight  of  the  Muslims  (Ben  Zion  Weiss,  Letters,  AJN1/11/02).   How  about  a  forum  to  convince  fellow-Jews  that  we  should  spend  more  time  and  energy  understanding  our  own  people  and  the  plight  of  our  brethren  in  Israel  and  acting  as  advo  cates  for  ourselves  and  Israel?

"  THE  ironic  but  noperui  taie  oi  vvimuic   don  doubles  pairing  of  Pakistani  Mus  lim  Aisam  ul-Haq  Qureshi  and  Israeli  Amir  Hadad  (AJN  5/07/02)  occupied  sections  of  our  media  over  last  week.   Is  this,  however,  just  another  fuzzy  panda  tale  about  an  odd  couple  in  a   difficult  world?   Many  of  the  schools  of  criticism  being  directed  at  Israel  from  non  American  members  of  the  internation  al  community  seem  to  imply  that  the  Jewish  State  is  taking  a  paranoid,  pre  emptive  approach  to  the  threats  con  fronting  its  people.   That  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  is  manipulating  post-Septem  ber  11  American  pathos  to  force  a  solution  to  a  long-held  anti-Palestinian  and  anti-Arab  ideology.   That  the  regular  and  repeated  sui  cide  bomb  attacks  at  crowded  bus  shelters,  discos,  cafes  and  shopping  malls  are  not  quite  enough  to  justify  a  definitive  military  response.   According  to  reports,  Pakistani  ten  nis  has  never  enjoyed  an  achievement  as  significant  as  Qureshi’s  in  reaching  the  third  round  of  a  Grand  Slam  event.   The  player  has  made  sporting  his  tory  for  his  nation,  and  not  without  a  fair  degree  of  assistance  from  his  dou  bles  partner.   He  claims  that  he  never  thought  twice  about  the  unlikely  pairing  and  did  not  even  make  the  conscious  choice  to  see  Hadad  as  anything  but  another  human  being.   The  Pakistani  Government  is  quot  ed  to  be  strongly  considering  a  ban  for  Qureshi’s  crime.  Instead  of  embracing  the  opportunity  to  bask  in  the  bridge  building  potential  that  sport  can  gen  erate,  we  witness  a  declaration  of  hostility.   Whilst  even  the  good  deeds  of  the  Israeli  Jew  continue  to  be  portrayed  by  the  Muslim  world  as  offensive,  is  it  any  wonder  that  the  Israeli  Govern  ment  perhaps  feels  a  touch  threatened  by  its  neighbours?

"  Grassby  to  open  interfaith  program   THE  man  who  made  multicultualism  a  vital  part  of  Australian  life,  A1  Grassby,  will  open  an  afternoon  of  Muslim,  Jewish  and  Christian  poetry,  storytelling  and  music  at  the  Sydney  Writers’  Centre  on  Sunday,  March  3.   The  function  is  being  hosted  by  the  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  in  association  with  the  Gavemer  Foundation.   Entitled  “The  Resonances  of  the  Book”,  the  program  will  feature  Jewish,  Muslim  and  Christian  poets,  as  well  as  singers,  dancers  and  storytelling.   The  Central  Coast’s  Imam  Dhanvi  and   Temple  Emanuel  Rabbi  Jacqueline  Ninio  will  read  from  the  Koran  and  Psalms  respectively.  They  will  be  followed  by  readings  by  Islamic  poets  Ashraf  Shad  and  Gailan  Hoshi,  Christian  poets  Dr  David  Wansbrough  and  Anne  Fairbaim  and  Jewish  poet  Nora  Krouk.   According  to  organiser  Diana  Shapowloff,  the  aim  is  to  demonstrate  how  poetry,  music  and  lore  can  bring  the  three  faiths  together  in  a  spirit  of  understanding  and  harmony.

"  ABBosb  Et©©   A  LAPSE  in  security  by  a  Mount  Sinai  College  busdriver  —  who  offered  a  lift  to  a  Muslim  woman  who  subsequently  photographed  some  of  the  pupils  on  board—is  a  timely  reminder  of  the  need  to  be  vigilant,  communal  leaders  warn.   Described  by  Mount  Sinai  principal  Hairy  Taibel  as  a  “comedy  of  errors”,  the  incident  occurred  last  Tuesday—two  days  after  the  Bali  bombing.   The  incident  involved  Sandie,  the  regular  driver  of  the  bus  service  which  transports  Mount  Sinai  and  Emanuel  School  students.   A  Muslim  woman  wearing  a  traditional  scarf  approached  the  Emanuel  security  guard,  identi  fied  herself  as  a  Malaysian  tourist  and  asked  for  directions  to  the  Olympic  site  at  Homebush.   The  guard  directed  her  to  Sandie,  who  gave  the  woman  instructions  and  then  offered  her  a  lift  as  far  as  Randwick  Village.  While  on  the  bus,  the  woman  produced  a  camera  and  took  a  pho  tograph  of  some  of  the  students.   Mr  Taibel  praised  the  alertness  of  the  stu  dents,  who  informed  the  school  about  what  had  occurred:  “they  knew  something  was  amiss”.   He  said  the  woman  would  not  have  “landed  up  on  the  bus  if  she  hadn’t  been  invited.  Sandie  has  been  driving  that  bus  for  three  years  and  is  a  good  Christian  soul.  She  loves  the  kids  and  they  love  her.  She  has  apologised  profusely.”   The  Communal  Security  Group,  which  over  sees  security  for  the  community,  said  while  the  matter  was  unfortunate,  noone  was  at  risk.   However,  the  bus  company  informed  the  police,  who  immediately  referred  the  incident  to  the  NSW  Police  Minister.   Viewing  the  footage  recorded  by  the  onboard  security  camera,  police  checked  their  files  and  determined  that  the  woman  was  not  a  threat.   As  of  last  Thursday,  the  number  of  children  being  transported  had  dropped  from  60  to  eight.   “It  will  take  time  to  regain  the  parents’  confi  dence,”  Mr  Taibel  admitted.  He  said  Sandie  had  offered  to  attend  an  awareness  course.   Emanuel  president  Michael  Lyons:  “Hopeful  ly  it  will  serve  as  a  warning  to  the  community  to  be  more  security-conscious.”   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman  lauded  Mount  Sinai’s  han  dling  of  the  incident,  which  included  immedi  ately  sending  a  letter  to  school  parents.   “However,  it  is  a  timely  reminder  for  the  community  that  proper  procedures  have  to  be  implemented.  I  urge  everyone  to  be  aware.   “The  CSG  is  expanding  its  training  processes  to  include  ordinary  members  of  the  community.  This  incident  shows  the  wisdom  of  having  all  members  of  the  community  familiar  with  proper  procedures  in  reporting  suspicious  incidents.”   A  CSG  spokesperson  said  it  was  imperative  for  people  to  realise  that  security  “is  everyone’s  responsibility.  All  institutions  need  to  be  aware  of  people  entering  their  premises  and  the  pro  cedures  to  ensure  everyone’s  safety.”   H  The  need  to  be  vigilant,  page  16 ",2002-10-25
"  PROFESSOR  Bill  Rubinstein’s  remarks  about  the  threat  posed  to  Australia  by  Muslim  asylum-seekers  (AIN  1/3/02)  are  repugnant  and  misguided.   He  paints  a  black  and  threatening  picture  of  these  unfortunate  people.  If  admitted,  many  won’t  find  jobs  and  will  “fester  in  the  underworld  of   crime,  drugs  and  prostitution”.   If  they  aren’t  fundamentalists  on  arrival,  many  will  become  so.  To  top  things  off,  many  of  them,  he  surmis  es,  hate  Jews.  Whether  the  latter  is  true,  I  do  not  know.  But  liking  Jews  —  or  any  other  group  —  is  hardly  a  con  dition  of  entry  into  Australia.   Professor  Rubinstein  rejects  the  often-claimed  similarities  between  today’s  asylum-seekers  and  the  Jewish  refugees  of  the  1930s.  The  more  apt  comparison  is  with  the  European  debates  over  Jewish  eman  cipation  in  the  late  18th  century.   There  were  those  who  looked  at  the  dire  social  condition  of  the  Jews  and  the  strangeness  of  their  religion  and  concluded  they  could  never  be  productive  and  loyal  citizens.   And  there  were  those  who  realised  that  the  provision  of  rights  and  exten  sion  of  opportunities  would  bring  about  social  improvement  and  inte  gration.  The  last  200  years  have  amply  verified  the  second  expecta  tion.  Only  prejudice  blinds  people  to  this  reality.   On  another  issue,  I  couldn’t  agree   more  with  Professor  Rubinstein:  his  criticism  of  the  paucity  of  support,  in  our  community,  for  university  Jewish   Studies.  At  UNSW,  where  we  have  built  up  a  popular  and  respected  Jewish  Studies  Program  over  the  past  six  years,  we  are  contemplating  the  program’s  demise  for  want  of  finan  cial  support.

"  Jews  and  Muslims  welcome  ritual  slaughter  ruling   A  ruling  supporting   Islamic  ritual  slaughter  has  received  support  across  the  Islamic   Jewish  divide,  reports  Toby  AxeSrod.   JEWISH  and  Muslim  groups  across  Germany  are  applauding  the  rever  sal  of  a  law  that  banned  Islamic  ritu   al  slaughter  in  Germany.   Last  month’s  decision  by  the  high  court  in  Karlsruhe  was  seen  as  an   affirmation  of  religious  freedom  in  Germany  and  Europe.   The  court  decision,  which  over  turned  a  1995  law  forbidding  Islamic  ritual  slaughter  in  Germany,  came  in  response  to  a  suit  brought  by  a  Turkish  butcher,  Ruestem  Altinkuepe.   He  claimed  Germany  was  restrict  ing  his  religious  freedom  and  his  ability  to  earn  a  living  by  forbidding  him  from  performing  ritual  slaugh  ter.  Jewish  ritual  slaughter  is  permit  ted  in  Germany.   The  Central  Council  of  Muslims  in   Germany  praised  the  15  January  decision  for  “making  it  possible  once  again  for  Muslims  in  Germany  to  carry  out  ritual  slaughter  according  to  Islamic  instructions.  This  decision  indicates  an  even-handed  treatment  of  Muslims  with  other  religious  com  munities  and  secures  their  basic   right  to  practice  their  faith.”   Pinchas  Kornfeld,  chairman  of  the  Belgium-based  European  Board  of  Shechitah  said  his  board  also   praised  the  decision  and  hoped  it  confirmed  the  EU  regulation  that  protects  the  right  to  ritual  slaughter.   Animal  protection  groups  reacted  with  dismay  to  the  decision,  but  the  German  Animal  Protection  League  and  the  Union  Against  Abuse  of  Animals  said  they  would  continue  trying  to  ban  ritual  slaughter  across  Europe.   “I  was  shocked  by  the  decision”,  said  Jorg  Styrie,  a  vice-president  of  the  Union  Against  Abuse  of  Animals.   “This  is  a  backward  step,  not  a  forward  step.  It  will  make  our  work  a   lot  harder”.   Mr  Styrie  said  he  had  received  12  phone  calls  from  angry  animal  rights   activists  after  the  decision  was  announced.   “I  heard  a  lot  of  xenophobic  state  ments  against  Muslims,”  said  Mr  Styrie.   He  said  that  some  people  who  live  in  Muslim  communities  in  Germany  have  complained  that  dur  ing  certain  festivals  their  neighbours  slaughter  animals  in  their  garages,  and  that  blood  flows  onto  the  street.   Kosher  slaughter  is  legal  through  out  Europe,  except  in  Switzerland  and  Sweden.  The  Swiss  government  recently  launched  a  campaign  to  end  a  century-old  law  barring  Jewish  rit  ual  slaughter,  but  the  move  created  a  heated  outcry.   In  1995,  Germany  declared  the  strict  Islamic  method  of  slaughter  illegal,  in  part  because  law-makers  determined  that  Islam  was  not  as  clear  as  Judaism  in  forbidding  the  slaughter  of  an  unconscious  animal,  and  therefore  determined  that  it  should  be  possible  for  Muslim  butchers  to  produce  halal  meat  under  the  existing  German  law.   Aside  from  the  exception  for   kosher  slaughter,  Germany  requires  that  an  animal  be  rendered  uncon  scious  before  slaughter.   Both  the  German  Animal  Protection  League  and  the  Union  Against  Abuse  of  Animals  cite  stud  ies  that  they  say  show  an  animal  suf  fers  more  during  ritual  slaughter  than  if  it  is  killed  after  being  stunned.   Proponents  of  kashrut  deny  that  an  animal  feels  any  more  pain  through  kosher  slaughter  than  through  other  methods.  To  make  their  case,  they  cite  studies  in  which  animals’  brain  waves  were  measured  during  slaughter.   But  such  arguments  often  fall  on  deaf  ears,  says  Rabbi  Israel  Meir  Levinger,  chairman  of  the  European   Kashrus  Commission.   ""l  know  the  animal  protection   groups  are  against  it,  but   the  Jewish  and  Muslim  way   is  the  better  way.”   Mohammed  Herzog,  spokesman  for  the  Islamic   Society  of  German-Speaking  Muslims   “I  talked  a  few  weeks  ago  with  the  president  of  an  animal  protection  group  in  Switzerland,  and  he  said  to  me,  ‘You  are  right,  from  a  scientific  view  shechita  is  not  bad,  but  emo-  tionally,  people  won’t  have  it’.”   Rabbi  Levinger  lives  in  Basel,  Switzerland.  His  1996  book,  Shechita  in  the  Light  of  the  Year  2000,  has  become  a  reference  for  both  sup-  porters  and  opponents  of  shechita.   German  animal  rights  groups  plan  to  co-ordinate  with  related  organisations  across  Europe,  bring-  ing  their  campaign  to  the  European  Union  seat  in  Brussels.   Mr  Styrie  said:  “It  may  be  time  for  religions  to  think  over  the  way  things  are  done.  I  have  to  ask  if  it  is  possible  today  within  Judaism  to  anaesthetise  the  animal  first.  I  am  of  the  opinion  that  religion  must  exam-  ine  itself,  examine  its  teachings”.   Aware  that  Hitler’s  first  anti-  Jewish  regulations  were  prohibitions  on  shechita,  German  animal-rights  advocates  say  they  are  not  antisemit-  ic  and  claim  that  their  goal  is  only  to  reduce  the  suffering  of  animals.   Mr  Kornfeld  said  he  was  “not   worrying”  about  new  threats  to  kashrut  in  Europe.   “In  the  last  10  years  we  had  a  few  problems,  and  thank  God  we  suc-  ceeded  in  stopping  them,”  he  said.   “We  are  in  permanent  contact   with  the  animal  protection  peoplef  and  we  try  to  bring  them  scientific  evidence  to  show  them  that  shechita  is  not  worse  than  any  other  way  of  killing  animals,  and  1  would  say  even  better.  But  banning  shechita  will  always  be  on  someone’s  agenda.”   In  Germany,  butchers  are  required  to  stun  an  animal,  usually  with  a  bolt  fired  into  the  brain,  so  that  it  is  uncon-  scious  before  slaughter.  An  exception  was  granted  for  the  kosher  form  of  slaughter,  because  a  kosher  butcher  requires  training  and  a  license  and  is  presumed  to  take  precautions  against  an  animal’s  suffering.   While  similar  to  kashrut,  the  Islamic  method  of  butchering  does  not  require  the  same  level  of  train-  ing,  experts  say.   In  addition,  Islamic  scholars  in  Mecca  and  Cairo  ruled  several  years  ago  that  stunning  an  animal  before  slaughtering  it  did  not  interfere  with  the  proscription  against  eating  meat  from  an  animal  that  had  died  on  its   own.   Germany  therefore  felt  justified  in  passing  the  1995  law.   The  recent  court  case  stemmed  from  the  fact  that  the  rulings  from  Mecca  and  Cairo  are  not  accepted  by  many  religious  Muslims.   Banning  this  form  of  slaughter  would  be  “a  problem  for  us  Muslims,  just  as  much  as  it  would  be  for  our  fellow  Jewish  citizens,”  said  Mohammed  Herzog,  a  spokesman  for  the  Berlin-based  Islamic  Society  of  German-Speaking  Muslims.   Those  in  Germany  who  wish  to  eat  meat  slaughtered  according  to  Islamic  law  usually  get  it  from  other   countries,  he  said.   “I  know  the  animal  protection  groups  are  against  it,  but  the  Jewish  and  Muslim  way  is  the  better  way,”  Mr  Herzog  added.  The  animal  does  not  suffer  as  much  as  with  the  elec-  tric  bolt.”   Rabbi  Levinger  said  Jewish  and  Islamic  groups  in  Europe  co-operate  only  to  a  limited  extent  on  fighting  bans  of  shechita,  in  part  because   their  methods  of  slaughter  are  not   identical.   “Since  there  are  many  millions  of  Muslims  in  Europe,  it  is  worthwhile  to  work  with  them,  but  we  do  not  want  people  to  equate  their  shechita   with  ours,”  he  said.

"  How  the  crisis  affects  us  —  world  delegates  report   About  120  women  from  52  nations  are  converging  on  Sydney  this  week  for  the  International  Council  of  Jewish  Women’s  19th  Triennial   Convention.  The  Australian  Jewish  News  asked  some  of  the  delegates  how  events  in  Israel  are  impacting  on  their  communities.   Ray  Wolder  South  Africa   WE  have  a   virulent  Muslim   population   which  spreads  anti-Israel  misin  formation.

We  need  PR  so  that  our  black  fel  low  South  Africans  realise  that  South  African  Jews  are  constructively  involved  in  working  towards  a  better   life  for  all.   Phyllis  Gottdiener  Vermont,  USA   PEOPLE  are  uneasy  about  the   situation  in  Israel,  Jews  and  non-Jews  alike.  Israel  seems  to  arise  in  every  conversation.  Many  friends  have  children  and  grandchil   dren  there.   Everyone  is  uncomfortable,  but  there  has  been  a  strong  groundswell  of  support  from  the  US  President  and  government  in  support  of  Israel.   There  was  an  antisemitic  letter  to  the  editor  in  the  paper,  and  it  received  many  quick  responses.   We  should  encourage  our  govern  ments  to  support  the  Israeli  action  to  combat  suicide  bombers.  We  should  find  ways  to  educate  our  societies  about  Israel’s  history,  and  keep  the  emails  to  Israel  flowing.

It  is  aZionistic  community;  almost  every  family  has  a  son,  daughter,  brother  or  sister  in  Israel.  In  the  last  20  years  almost  half  of  the  commu  nity  has  made  aliyah.   What  happens  in  Israel  is  there  fore  of  great  concern,  and  recent  events  have  had  a  great  impact  on  us.  Several  activities  have  been  organ  ised  to  support  Israel.

A  rally  in  London  in  support  of  peace  in  Israel  attracted  40,000  peo  ple.  One  speaker,  an  Israeli  mother  whose  daughter  had  been  injured  in  an  attack,  spoke  of  her  wish  for  fami  lies  to  “adopt”  an  Israeli  family  that  had  a  member  killed  or  injured.   Dr  Melita  Svob  Croatia   THE  events   in  Israel  are   reported  in  the  media,  but  often  not  objec  tively,  showing  ruined   Palestinian   houses  and  cry  ing  Palestinian  children.  We   often  see  the  militant  Anel  Sharon  ,   with  condemnations  by  the  interna-  |   tional  community.   The  Croatian  delegation  at  the  UN  abstained  from  voting  for  the  resolu  tion  condemning  Israel,  and  some  of  Croatia’s  political  parties  and  the   media  criticised  this  decision.

The  effect  on  the  community  is  seen  in  many  different  ways.  For  the  Israeli  Ambassador  and  her  family,  it  means  she  cannot  move  without  a   bodyguard  and  policeman.  For  the   Zionist  movements  it  has  meant  an   ongoing  fight  with  the  media.   Some  want  to  ‘keep  their  heads  down,  and  in  the  worst  scenarios  don’t  want  people  to  know  they  are  Jewish.  Most  are  hungry  for  news  that  is  unbiased.

"  South  African  Jews  criticise  Israel  for  ‘crisis’  remarks   Moira  Schneider   CAPE  TOWN  —  South  African  Jewish  leaders  are  criticising  Israel  for  suggesting  that  the  community  is  in  crisis.   The  move  comes  after  Israeli  officials  offered  enhanced  benefits  to  immigrants  from  South  Africa,  Argentina  and  France.   Also  under  attack  is  a  report  emanating  from  Israeli  Government  sources,  published  here,  alleging  that  the  South  African  Jewish  community  “felt  under  siege”  from  the  country’s  large  Islamic  community  and  a  South  African  Government  policy  that  “has  taken  a  pro-Muslim  turn”.   South  African  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  past  chairman  Mervyn  Smith  appeared  on  national  radio  and  television  to  explain  the  Board’s  stance  on  the  issue.  Israel’s  increased  subsidies  are  welcome,  he  said,  but  the  reasons  given  for  the  move  are  “harmful”  to  the  South  African  Jewish  community.   “We’ve  lived  with  the  Muslim  community  for  many  years,  and  there  are  elements  that  are  radical,  but  it  would  be  a  big  exaggeration  to  say  South  African  Jews  should  go  on  aliyah  because  of  their  attitude,”  he  said.   “What  drives  emigration  are  the  factors  affecting  all  communities,  such  as  the  increase  in  violent  crime  and  the  economic  situation.   We’re  unhappy  with  a  lot  of  what  the  Muslim  community  has  done,  but  we  certainly  don’t  consider  ourselves  to  be  under  any  meaningful  constant  physical  threat.   “It  is  also  not  correct  to  say  that  the  South  African  Government  has  turned  pro-Muslim,”  he  added.  “It  has  turned  pro-Palestinian  and  against  Israel,  but  it’s  quite  wrong  to  suggest  that  Jews  are  lesser  citizens  in  this  country.  On  the  contrary,  we  have  good  relations  with  the  government  and  there’s  no  suggestion  that  it  is  against  us.”   Motti  Talmor,  head  of  the  Aliyah  Department  of  the  South  African  Zionist  Federation,  denied  that  the  increased  benefits   are  a  response  to  a  perceived  crisis  in  the  country’s  Jewish  community.   While  emphasising  that  the  situation  here  was  in  no  way  comparable  to  that  pertaining  in  crisis-ridden  Argentina,  he  said  the  devaluation  of  the  rand  and  the  difficulty  many  potential  immigrants  experienced  in  selling  their  property  had  prompted  Israel’s  “tailor-made  financial  assistance”  for  the  South  African  community.   South  African  Chief  Rabbi  Cyril  Harris  said  no  significance  should  be  attached  to  the  fact   that  he  has  called  on  the  nation’s  rabbis  to  inform  congregations  of  the  benefits  available  from  Israel  to  those  thinking  of  moving  there.   He  was  sceptical  that  the  benefits  would  lead  to  a  marked  increase  in  South  Africans  moving  to  Israel,  nor  does  he  expect  the  benefits  to  impact  on  emigres  headed  for  countries  like  Australia  and  Canada.   While  acknowledging  that  the  Muslim  population  —  particularly  in  Cape  Town  —  is  cause  for  legitimate  concern,  he  added:  “Israel  imagines  it’s  a  bigger  crisis  than  we  do.”   About  40  per  cent  of  emigrating  Jewish  South  Africans  head  to  Australia,  25  per  cent  to  the  United  States  and  18  per  cent  to  Israel.  Just  182  people  applied  to  go  on  aliyah  in  2001.  An  estimated  65,000  Jews  remain  in   South  Africa,  from  a  ceiling  of  120,000.   JTA ",2002-02-22
"  Board  of  Deputies   condemns  Nile  remark   THE  leader  ship  of  the  New  South  Wales  Jewish  community   has  con  demned  last  week’s  call  by  Christian   Democrat  MP  Reverend  Fred  Nile  for  tradi  tional  Islamic  dress  to  be  banned  as  “inappropriate  and  misdi  rected”.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of   Fred  Nile   Deputies  Stephen  Rothman  con  demned  the  implicit  assumption  in  Reverend  Nile’s  statement  that  a  ter  rorist  would  have  a  particular  appear  ance  “or  would  dress  in  accordance   with  a  particular  religious  or  ethnic  grouping”.   “The  vast  majority  of  Muslims  in  Australia  are,  like  all  non-indigenous  Australians,  immigrants  or  the  descendants  of  immigrants  who  are  here  for  a  better  life  and  are  no  more  terrorists  than  is  Reverend  Nile,”  Mr  Rothman  said.   “It  is  not  the  experience,  even  in  Israel,  for  terrorists  to  be  dressed  in  traditional  Muslim  clothing,  and  any  form  of  clothing  could  conceal  suffi  cient  explosive.   “More  fundamentally,  govern  ments  in  Australia  must  be  vigilant  to  ensure  to  that  their  actions  and  law  secure  the  very  democracy  that  Reverend  Nile  purports  to  protect.   “Australia  is  one  of  the  most  toler   ant  and  inclusive  democracies  in  the  world;  Reverend  Nile’s  call  would  destroy  the  very  tolerance  and  demo  cratic  principles  that  he  says  he  seeks  to  protect.”   Protection  from  terrorism  includes,  “quintessentially,  the  battle  for  tolerance  by  and  for  all  faiths,  races  and  ethnic  groups  and  the  recognition  that  all  human  beings  are  entitled  to  have  their  beliefs  respected”,  Mr  Rothman  said.   Reverend  Nile’s  call  “is  an  exam   ple  of  throwing  the  baby  out  with  the   bathwater”.   “The  banning  of  cultural  clothing  —Muslim,  Jewish,  Sikh  or  Scottish—  is  unprincipled,  undemocratic  and   un-Australian.”   The  leader  of  the  Uniting  Church  expressed  concern  that  Reverend  Nile’s  comments  “may  give  the  false  impression  that  the  Australian  Christian  community  supports  intol  erance  toward  the  beliefs  and  prac  tices  of  Australian  Muslims”.   “We  support  the  right  of  Muslim  women  to  wear  whatever  clothing  they  feel  is  appropriate  in  accordance  with  their  beliefs,”  said  Reverend  Professor  James  Haire,  president  of  the  Uniting  Church.   Professor  Haire  also  expressed  concern  at  the  linking  of  religion  and  ethnicity  with  violent  acts,  pointing  out  that  terrorism  has  been  con  demned  by  Muslim,  Jewish  and  Christian  religious  leaders.   “The  Uniting  Church  is  committed  to  Australia  as  a  multicultural  country  in  which  the  beliefs  and  practices  of  people  of  all  faiths  are  respected.   “Now  more  than  ever,  it  is  vital  that  we  live  in  peace  and  with  understand  ing.” ",2002-11-29
"  South  African  march   glorifies  suicide  bombers   Michael  Belling   CAPE  TOWN  —  The  South  African  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  is  consid  ering  filing  charges  against  the  organisers  of  a  march  here  that  included  boys  dressed  as  Muslim  suicide  bombers,  some  even  wear  ing  mock  dynamite  sticks  strapped  to  their  chests.   Last  Friday’s  march,  arranged  by  the  radical  Muslim  group  Kibla  to  show  solidarity  with  Palestinians,  has  shocked  the  Jewish  community.   The  march  coincided  with  the  55th   anniversary  of  the  1947  United  Nations  partition  resolution,  which   led  to  the  establishment  of  the  State  of  Israel—an  event  also  marked  an  hour   earlier  by  a  pro-lsrael  Christian  group  demonstrating  outside  parliament.   Two  youths  marching  in  support  of  the  Palestinian  cause  wore  Hezbollah  headbands,  followed  by  eight  other  young  people  carrying  mock  weapons.  They  led  more  than  300  demonstrators  from  a  mosque  close  to  downtown  Cape  Town  to  the  US  Consulate,  about  a  mile  away.   The  marching  children,  some  as  young  as  seven,  carried  placards  stating:  “Death  to  America,  death  to  Israel.”  Marchers  shouted,  “One  American,  one  bullet,”  echoing  a  slo  gan  using  during  the  apartheid  years  to  refer  to  white  South  Africans  —  one  settler,  one  bullet.   The  march  organisers  asked  the   protesters  to  stop  chanting  these  slogans.  The  children  also  staged  a   mock  attack  on  a  model  of  an  Israeli  tank  and  ripped  apart  an  Israeli  flag.  Outside  the  US  Consulate,  an  Israeli  flag  was  burned  amid  chants  of  “Death  to  Israel,  death  to  Sharon”.  Russell  Gaddin,  national  chairman  of  the  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  said  that  the  board  respected  the  consti  tutional  right  to  freedom  of  speech.   “But  this  goes  beyond  freedom  of  speech.  It  was  a  disgraceful  display  of  hate  speech,  incitement  and  anti  semitism,”  he  said.  “It  glorifies  terror  ism,  which  has  been  condemned  by  the  South  African  government  itself.”   Another  strong  condemnation  of  the  events  came  from  Mervyn  Smith,  president  of  the  African  Jewish  Congress  and  a  former  national   chairman  of  the  board.   “It  is  scandalous  that  murderous   thugs  should  be  portrayed  as  heroes  to  young  children,”  he  said.   One  of  the  march’s  co-ordinators   reportedly  said  children  are  vital  in  driving  home  the  message  that  Palestinians  were  sacrificing  them  selves  to  fight  Israel.   But  Imam  Gassan  Solomon,  spokesman  for  the  more  moderate  Muslim  Judicial  Council,  said:  “As  Muslims,  we  are  duty  bound  to  con  demn  terrorism.”   There  are  some  15,000  Jews  in  Cape  Town,  while  the  Muslim  popu  lation  is  more  than  500,000.

"  Letters   ADVANCE  Australia  Fairly  is  the  well-chosen  title  of  an  innovative  anti   racism  campaign  which  was  launched  last  week  by  the  NSW  Anti   Discrimination  Board.   Yet  the  fact  that  the  Australian  Jewish  community  has  sustained  the  worst  wave  of  antisemitic  incidents  in  its  history  was  completely  ignored   at  the  launch.   Designed  to  deliver  the  message  that  racism  is  unacceptable,  the  pro  gram  has  several  components,  including  postcards  featuring  Muslim  rugby  league  player  Hazem  El  Masri  —  who  represented  Australia  against  New  Zealand  on  Saturday  night  —  television  presenter  Indira  Naidoo,  Sheikh  Yahya  Safi  and  Rabbi  Selwyn  Franklin.   The  theme  is  acceptance  of  diversity  —  that  we  are  all  Australians,  equally  and  together,  yet  within  that  umbrella  are  entitled  to  pursue  dif  fering  religions  and  lifestyles  free  from  discrimination  and  racism.   It  is  a  commendable  initiative,  particularly  in  the  current  climate—one  which  has  seen  an  alarming  surge  in  racism,  fuelled  mainly  by  the  intifada,  which  has  claimed  620  Israeli  and  1800  Palestinian  lives;  and  September  11  and  its  aftermath,  creating  an  atmosphere  of  vulnerability  in  the  world.   The  first  event  has  generated  antisemitic  incidents,  while  the  second  has  ignited  a  wave  of  Islamophobia.   But  in  launching  the  Advance  Australia  Fairly  campaign,  the  unprece  dented  upsurge  in  antisemitic  attacks  did  not  rate  a  single  mention.  In  a  2300-word  introduction,  Anti-Discrimination  Board  president  Chris  Puplick  repeatedly  —  and  correctly  —  drew  attention  to  the  rise  in  vilifi   cation  of  Australians  of  the  Islamic  faith.   But  what  about  us?  What  about  the  unprecedented  rise  in  antisemitic  incidents  in  Australian  Jewish  history?   According  to  statistics  logged  by  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry,  the  number  of  antisemitic  incidents  in  the  past  year  has  been  approximately  150  per  cent  worse  than  average  and  60  per  cent  worse  than  the  previous  worst  year,  2001.   Over  a  13-year  period,  the  ECAJ  has  logged  an  average  of  240  incidents  a  year.  In  April  this  year,  there  were  130  incidents  —  six  times  the  month  ly  average.  The  previous  worst  month  was  October  2000,  with  75.   Yet  none  of  this  was  deemed  worthy  of  mention.  Mr  Puplick  noted  that  during  the  1991  Gulf  War,  “Muslim  women  were,  as  they  are  now,  the  tar  gets  of  antipathy  towards  Australia’s  Muslim  community”.  Yet  six  Sydney  synagogues  were  attacked  during  the  Gulf  War—one  of  them,  Bankstown,  never  to  be  rebuilt  —  but  again,  not  a  mention.   How  can  the  Anti-Discrimination  Board  launch  an  anti-racism  campaign  by  focusing  on  the  unacceptable  level  of  hatred  towards  the  Muslim  com  munity,  yet  not  mention  the  unacceptable  level  of  hatred  towards  the  Jew  ish  community?   Why  is  it  that  barely  a  murmur  is  heard  in  parliament,  or  from  media  commentators?  One  MP  who  has  raised  the  issue  is  Member  for  Vaucluse  Peter  Debnam,  who  did  so  recently  after  witnessing  a  grandfather  and  his  grand-daughter  being  harassed  while  walking  home  on  a  Friday  night.   It  would  appear  that  antisemitic  incidents  have  come  to  be  regarded  as  unexceptional,  and  therefore  unobjectionable.  That  acceptance  is  unac  ceptable.  Such  incidents  must  be  denounced  as  reprehensible.   It  is  untenable  that  an  anti-racism  campaign  can  be  launched  by  the  Anti-Discrimination  Board  without  giving  the  issue  even  a  cursory  men   tion.   Mr  Puplick  was  correct  to  criticise  the  anti-discrimination  laws  as  being  ineffective  and  in  need  of  being  tightened.   That  point  notwithstanding,  when  the  worst  spate  of  attacks  in  the  Jew  ish  community’s  history  is  ignored  at  an  anti-racism  campaign  launch  —  at  which  attacks  on  the  Muslim  community  are  deemed  worthy  of  empha   sis  —  there  is  a  breakdown  somewhere.

"  Changing  the  world   NewsB   from  the  ground  up   Vic  ABhadcff   THERE  is  a  move  afoot  to  change  the  world,  and  it’s  taking  root  right  here  in  Sydney.   It  may  not  be  bringing  down  despotic  governments  or  conquer  ing  mountains,  but  it  is  certainly  making  inroads.   Tiny,  incremental  roads,  unno  ticed  by  most,  but  inroads  never  theless  —  chipping  away  at  residues  of  prejudice,  promoting  ethnic  tolerance,  dispensing  good  will  and  harmony.   At  the  heart  of  this  celebration  of  difference  are  a  rabbi,  a  Muslim  representative  and  a  lay  Catholic.   The  trio  enter  schools  and,  through  informal  dialogue  and  carefully-devised  activities,  impart  a  message  of  respect  and  benevo  lence,  underscored  by  emphasis  on  the  ability  of  the  individual  to  make  a  difference.   The  brainchild  of  North  Shore  Chabad  House  Rabbi  Zalman  Kastel,  the  Goodness  and  Kindness  Campaign  has  touched  600  stu  dents  at  seven  primary  schools  across  Sydney,  including  Masada  College.

The  point  was  most  tellingly  made  in  the  opening  minutes,  when  Muslim  representative  Seyfi  Seyit  introduced  Rabbi  Kastel  —  who  responded  in  kind  —  and  then  invited  the  100  pupils  in  the  audi  ence  to  guess  who  was  Muslim  and  who  was  Jewish;  only  50  per  cent  of  the  audience  got  the  answer  right.   “Which  shows  that  you  can’t   always  tell,”  Mr  Seyit  emphasised,  “and  that  you  shouldn’t  judge  by  appearances.”   Rabbi  Kastel  informed  the  pupils  that  he  and  his  colleagues  were  inviting  them  “to  help  us  in  an  enormous  project  —  changing  the  world”.   “We  want  to  make  it  a  more   friendly  and  peaceful  place,  but  we  can’t  do  it  by  ourselves.  So  we’re  asking  young  people  to  help  us.  I  hope  we  can  count  on  you  to  be  part  of  our  team,  working  together  with  schools  across  Sydney.”   Mr  Seyit:  “The  project  is  about  being  good  and  kind.  We  all  want  a  safe  and  happy  life.  A  good  and  kind  world.  So  it’s  up  to  you.  You  are  the  leaders  of  the  next  genera  tion  —  our  future  prime  ministers,  lawyers,  doctors  and  imams.”   He  and  Rabbi  Kastel  outlined  many  of  the  similarities  between  Islam  and  Judaism  —  belief  in  one  God,  various  prophets,  eating  ritu  ally-prepared  meat,  verbal  expres  sions  —  after  which  the  pupils  plied  Rabbi  Kastel  with  questions  about  Jewish  customs.   Catholic  representative  Ray  Corbin  related  an  anecdote  to  encourage  acceptance  of  differ  ence,  whereupon  the  students  played  interactive  games,  the  implicit  messages  being  co-opera  tion  and  commonalities.   Finally,  the  pupils  created  patchworks  which  included  per  sonal  undertakings  of  what  each  would  do  to  make  a  difference.  The  collected  efforts  from  all  partici  pating  schools  will  be  stitched  onto  giant  quilts  and  publicly  mounted  on  Harmony  Day  on  March  23  next  year.   Mr  Seyit:  “It’s  important  in  the   Muslim  representative  Seyfl  Seylt  (centre,  green  shirt)  with  Catholic  colleague  Ray  Corbin  (white  shirt),  Rabbi  Zalman  Kastel  and   students  at  Aikana  School  this  week.   present  climate  to  promote  mutual  respect  and  understanding  among  young  people.  Hopefully,  it  will  allay  lots  of  the  inhibitions  and  fears  that  are  generated  by  much  of  the  media.  This  is  a  great  way  to  spread  the  message  of  love  and   kindness.”   Arkana  principal  Madenia  Abdurahman:  “Our  board  had  no   problems  agreeing  to  be  part  of  this  program.   “It’s  important  for  people  to  be   tolerant  of  one  another  and  for  the   religions  to  respect  one  another  —  and  in  the  current  climate  for  the  kids  to  know  that  they  aren’t  the  only  people  who  are  suffering.   “The  media,  and  comments  like  Reverend  Fred  Nile’s,  do  so  much  damage,  whipping  up  hatred  against  the  Muslim  community,  especially  women.  We’re  easy  tar  gets.  1  left  South  Africa  because  of   that.”   The  Goodness  and  Kindness   Campaign  —  which  enjoys  the  sup  port  of  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  and  the  patronage  of  author  Thomas  Keneally  and  high-profile  businessman  Gerry  Harvey  —  has  also  visited  St  Ives  North,  Yaguna,  Lewisham,  Rozelle  and  Ashbury  public  schools.   The  final  word  from  an  Arkana   pupil:  “They  showed  us  that  we’re  all  different,  but  we’re  all  one.  It’s  the  first  time  I  met  a  Jewish  rabbi.  He  was  cool.” ",2002-11-29
"  Why  reward  intolerance?   As  Jews  celebrate  the  rededication  of  the  temple,  SVlicBiael   Freund  examines  the  reality  of  the  Jewish   holy  places  now  under  Israeli  control.   N  interesting  thing  happened  on   the  way  to  the  Temple  Mount  AIL  on  the  first  Friday  of  Ramadan,  something  which  should  have  created  a  furore,  but  has  in  fact  evoked  not  even  a  peep  of  protest.   According  to  media  reports,  some  135,000  people  converged  on  the  holy  site,  seeking  to  pray  there.  Thousands  of  police  were  on  hand  to  maintain  order,  and  all  of  the  visi  tors  succeeded  in  ascending  the  mount  in  a  safe  and  orderly  fashion.   All,  that  is,  except  for  one.   The  sole  exception,  said  Israel  Radio,  was  a  Jew,  who,  having  tried  to  conceal  his  identity  by  donning  a  kef  fiyeh,  was  stopped  by  Israeli  police  and  arrested  for  attempting  to  enter  the  area.  The  other  134,999  visitors,  all  of  whom  just  happened  to  be  Muslim,  were  able  to  freely  climb  the  stairs  leading  up  to  the  Temple  Mount,  entering  and  exiting  as  they  wished.   And  so,  just  54  years  after  the  Jewish  people  regained  their  nation  al  sovereignty,  and  just  three^and-a  half  decades  after  they  liberated  the  Temple  Mount,  Jewish  policemen  stand  guard  at  Judaism’s  holiest  site   to  ensure  that  no  Jews  can  enter  it.   Except,  of  course,  those  with  a  more  convincing  disguise.   At  Hebron’s  Tomb  of  the   Patriarchs,  burial  place  of  Israel’s  founding  fathers  and  mothers,  the  situation  is  not  much  better.  For  the  past  eight  years,  Israel  has  divided   use  of  the  tomb  between  Jewish  and  Muslim  visitors.   That  may  sound  equitable  in  the  ory,  but  consider  the  following:  Jews  were  allotted  just  706  square  meters  of  the  compound’s  total  area,  while  Muslims  were  given  control  over  3,073  square  metres,  more  than  four   times  the  area  allocated  to  Jews.   And,  except  for  10  days  each  year,  Jews  are  barred  from  setting  foot  on  the  80  per  cent  of  the  tomb  under   Muslim  control.   Then  there  is  Joseph’s  Tomb  in  Nablus,  where  the  Israeli  Army  pre  vents  Jews  from  even  coming  close  to  the  site,  citing  security  concerns.   Sadly,  the  pattern  emerging  from  these  examples  is  one  of  capitulation   Arab  MK’s  Abdul  Malik  Dehamshe  (left)  and  Ahmed  Tibi  encouraging  opposition  to  Ariel  Sharon’s  September  2000  visit  to  the  Temple  Mount  which  led  to  the  ban  on   non-Muslim  Visits  to  the  holy  Site.  Photo:  Isranet   and  surrender  in  the  face  of  intoler  ance.  Afraid  of  how  Muslims  might  react  if  Jews  were  allowed  to  pray  freely  at  these  sites,  the  government  chooses  the  path  of  least  resistance,  in  the  process  undermining  the  basic  civil  rights  of  its  citizens.   ""Just  54  years  after  the   Jewish  people  regained  their  national  sovereignty,  and  just  three-and-a-half  decades  after   they  liberated  the  Temple  Mount,  Jewish  policemen  stand  guard  at  Judaism’s  holiest  site  to  ensure  that   no  Jews  can  enter  it.”   Rather  than  standing  up  to  fanati  cism  and  bigotry,  Israel  has  caved  in  to  it,  effectively  rewarding  those  opposed  to  religious  freedom  and  the  rule  of  law.  But,  as  Thomas  Jefferson  once  noted,  “freedom  of  religion  is   the  most  inalienable  and  sacred  of  all   human  rights”.  Any  attempt  to  restrict  it  or  narrow  its  application,  he  asserted,  would  constitute  an  “infringement”  of  one  of  the  “natural  rights  of  mankind”.  Nevertheless,  such  “infringements”  have  become  all   too  common  here  of  late.   Though  we  are  used  to  hearing  about  democracy’s  need  for  a  wall  separating  church  and  state,  what  happens  when  the  state  itself  erects  a  wall  around  the  church  (or  syna  gogue,  as  it  were),  barring  entry  to   adherents?   There  is  another  way.  Just  north   of  Jerusalem,  in  an  old  and  dazzling  structure,  one  can  find  a  clear  exam  ple  of  how  Jewish  rights  and  Muslim  sensibilities  need  not  contradict  one  another.  Indeed,  the  tomb  of  the  prophet  Samuel  is  perhaps  the  only  major  holy  site  in  the  country  where  a  Jewish  synagogue  and  Muslim  mosque  operate  side  by  side  around  the  clock,  freely  and  without  hin  drance.  No  restrictions  are  imposed  on  either  group’s  right  to  worship  there,  no  division  of  the  site  is  in  place,  nor  are  any  policemen  posted  at  the  entrance  to  check  which  reli  gion  one  professes.   Instead,  a  surprisingly  quiet  and  peaceful  atmosphere  prevails,  one  in  which  all  visitors  are  able  to  worship  as  they  see  fit,  exemplifying  the  highest  ideals  of  Israel’s  democracy.  Though  Muslim  worshippers  might  wish  to  see  the  place  available  only  to  them,  the  government  has  acted  to  ensure  that  freedom  of  access  is  maintained  for  all.   If  it  can  be  done  at  the  Tomb  of  Samuel,  there  is  no  reason  why  it  cannot  be  done  elsewhere.  Freedom  of  access  for  Jews  to  their  most   sacred  of  sites  is  a  matter  of  princi  ple  whose  violation  should  no  longer  be  countenanced.   Sure,  it  might  raise  some  tempers  at  first,  provoke  some  opposition,  and  require  the  police  to  deploy  in  greater  numbers.  But  that,  quite  frankly,  is  their  job  to  ensure  that  law-abiding  citizens  are  able  to  exercise  their  most  fundamental  of  rights.  Without  having  to  resort  to  a  disguise.

"  Scurrilous  attack  in  Saudi  paper   SAUDI  Arabia  is  responsible  for  placing  a  Middle  East  peace  proposal  on  the  table  —  yet  the  following  scurrilous  antisemitic  diatribe  has  appeared  in  the  Saudi  Government  daily  Al-Riyadh.   Headlined  “Jews  use  teenagers’  blood  for  Purim  pastries”,  it  was  written  by  Dr  Umayma  Ahmad  Al  Jalahma  of  King  Faisal  University:   “Purim  has  customs  that  will  horrify  you.  The  Jewish  people   obtain  human  blood  so  that  their  clerics  can  prepare  pastries.   “Jews  spilling  human  blood  to  prepare  pastry  for  their  holidays  is  established  fact  throughout  history.  This  was  one  of  the  reasons  for  the  persecution  and  exile  that  were   their  lot  in  Europe  and  Asia.   “The  Jews  wear  masks  and  over   indulge  in  alcohol,  prostitution  and  adultery.  This  holiday  has  become  known  among  Muslim  historians  as  the  Holiday  of  Masks.   “I  would  like  to  tell  you  how  blood  is  spilled.  The  victim  must  be  a  mature  adolescent,  a  non-Jew  —  Christian  or  Muslim.  His  blood  is  taken  and  dried  into  granules.  The  cleric  blends  these  into  dough.  For  Passover  slaughtering,  the  blood  of  Christian  and  Muslim  children  under  10  must  be  used.   “A  needle-studded  barrel  is  used,  with  sharp  needles  on  all  sides.  [The  needles]  pierce  the  victim’s  body  from  the  moment  he  is  placed   in  the  barrel.   “The  victim  suffers  dreadful  torment  that  affords  the  Jewish  vampires  delight  as  they  monitor  the  blood-shedding  with  pleasure  and  love  that  are  difficult  to  comprehend.  After  this  barbaric  display,  the  Jewish  cleric  makes  his  co-religionists  happy  when  he  serves  the  pastries.   “The  victim  can  be  slaughtered  as  a  sheep  is  slaughtered.  Or  the  victim’s  veins  can  be  slit.  This  blood  is  collected  by  the  rabbi,  who  specialises  in  preparing  these  pastries.  The  human  race  refuses  to  look  at  the  Jewish  pastries,  let  alone  prepare  or  consume  them!”   Middle  East  Media  Research  Institute ",2002-03-22
"  From  tiie  Editor   THE  Goodness  and  Kindness  Campaign  being  run  by  North  Shore  Chabad  House  is  a  highly  commendable  initiative  which  all  synagogues,  dayschools,  communal  organisations  and  individual  members  of  the  community  would  do  well  to  support  —  and  emulate.   A  joint  JewisbMuslimGhristian  outreach  project,  it  demonstrates  the  ability  of  the  three  faiths  to  work  together  in  an  atmosphere  of  mutual  respect  and  goodwill,  while  organising  activities  among  schoolchildren  of  all  faiths,  religions  and  ethnic  backgrounds  designed  to  break  down  barriers  and  generate  acceptance.   The  benefits  of  the  scheme  —  both  imme  diate  and  potentially  longterm  —  are  impos  sible  to  quantify.   Such  a  program  is  welcome  at  any  time.  Occurring  at  a  time  of  unprecedented  tension,  distrust  and  suspicion  between  various  ethnic  and  religious  groups  —  fuelled  to  a  large  degree  by  reactionary  media  jockeys  —  it  is  not  just  welcome,  but  highly  essential.   Rabbis  Zalman  Kastel  and  Nochum  Schapiro  of  North  Shore  Chabad  House  are  to   be  commended  for  their  breadth  of  vision  .in  conceiving  of  this  program  —  as  are  Muslim  representative  Seyfi  Seyit  and  Catholic  repre  sentatives  Ray  Corbin  and  Joe  Shendan  for  playing  a  key  role  in  developing  it   Its  message  extends  to  each  member  of  this  community,  reminding  us  that  that  which  nnitps  us  all  is  far  greater  than  that  which   divides  us.   And  dial  for  all  our  sakes,  now  and  into  the  future,  we  all  need  to  embrace  our  own  per  sonal  Goodness  and  Kindness  campaign.  The  report  is  on  page  3.   As  for  Reverend  Fred  Nile’s  suggestion  that  Muslim  women  should  be  barred  from  wear  ing  chadors  in  public,  the  less  said  die  better.   Except  that  it  was  extremely  disappointing  that  neither  the  Prime  Minister  nor  the  Pre  mier  could  see  their  way  clear  to  swiftly  con  demning  it  as  inappropriate,  highly  offensive  and  guaranteed  to  inflame  even  further  the  ethnic  tensions  which  have  discoloured  Aus  tralian  society  since  September  11.

"  Letters   ISRAEL  S  non-Jewish  supporters  in  Australia  are  few  and  far  between.  So  when  a  leading  Christian  like  Reverend  Fred  Nile  speaks  his  mind  on  Islamic  clothing,  what  does  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  do?  Why,  condemn  him,  of  course!  (AJN  29/11/02).   Just  how  stupid  is  the  Board?  Or  more  to  the  point,  how  depressing-  ly  out  of  touch  with  most  Aus-   tralians  is  this  Board?   In  his  speech  in  the  NSW  Parlia-  ment  (Nov  20),  Reverend  Nile  asked:  “Is  it  a  fact  that  the  Islamic  female  terrorists  in  Hamburg,  Ger  many,  and  in  the  recent  Muslim  ter  rorist  attack  in  Moscow,  Russia,  wore  the  black  chador  body  cover-  ing  of  Iran  and  Saudi  Arabia?”   This  was  omitt  ed  from  your  arti-  cle  on  the  subject.  As  was,  referring  to  the  Moscow  theatre,  “female  Muslim  terrorists  carried  explo-  sives  strapped  to  their  bodies.  Is  it  a  fact  that  many  Muslim  women  in  Turkey,  Egypt,  Indonesia  etcetera  only  wear  discreet,  Western-style  clothing  and  not  the  chador?”   These  comments  putting  the  rev-  erend’s  opinion  in  context  were  also  left  out  of  your  article.   Most  Christian  Australians  are  thinking  people,  ready  to  swoop  on  their  enemies  before  their  enemies  can  do  harm;  willing  to  stand  up  and  be  counted,  and  point  the  fin-  ger  at  possible  terror  threats.   This  is  precisely  why  both  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Premier  refused  (yes,  refused)  to  contradict,  let  alone  condemn,  the  good  rev-  erend’s  comments.   It’s  time  the  so-called  leaders  of  the  Jewish  community  exhibited  the  same  commitment  to  the  con-  tinuation  of  their  faith  that  our  Christian  neighbours  show  to   theirs.

"  ..  ..  i  -..  .•  f  A--  .  --   We  should  fear  intolerance   LAST  Sunday,  a  handful  of  people  at  Temple  Emanuel  listened  to  the  stories  of  two  intelligent,  compas  sionate  human  beings  dedicating  their  lives  to  helping  asylum-seek  ers  get  justice  from  a  government  bent  on  incarcerating  as  criminals  people  simply  looking  for  a  chance  to  live  in  what  they  thought  was  a  free  country.   As  one  of  the  audience  asked,  how  different  is  this  from  what  our  parents  were  trying  to  do  after  the  Holocaust?  Both  speakers   were  Muslim.   The  previous  Sunday,  I  listened  to  four  speakers  at  Hakoah  Club  address  a  room  packed  with  hun  dreds  of  people  on  “Should  we   fear  Islam?”   I  was  shocked  by  the  prejudice  and  intolerance  shown  by  mem  bers  of  the  audience.   Justice  Marcus  Einfeld  was  called  a  “traitor”  because  he  dared  say  that  his  experience  of  Muslim  people  was  positive.   MC  Alan  Gold  threatened  to  stop  the  meeting  because  of  the  disrespectful  behaviour  of  people  who  seemed  more  bent  on  prov  ing  their  intolerant  and  prejudiced  views  true  than  listening  to  the  speakers.   How  different  is  this  from  the  meetings  in  Germany  in  the  ‘30s,  where  the  topic  would  have  been  “Should  we  fear  Jews?”   Surely  we  can’t  put  a  sixth  of  the  world’s  population  in  one  box  and  say  they’re  all  terrorists?   As  Justice  Einfeld  reminded  the   audience,  for  hundreds  of  years  it   was  the  Muslim  countries  that   protected  Jews  while  the  Chris  tians  burnt  them  at  the  stake.   Surely  we  can’t  have  forgotten   that  it  was  Christian  countries  like  Germany,   Hungary  and  Poland  that  mur  dered  six  million  Jews,  not  Mus  lims.   So  far,  it  has  only  been  a  Chris  tian  nation,  America,  that  has  used  a  weapon  of  mass  destruc  tion  on  a  civilian  population  at  Hiroshima  and  Nagasaki.   One  of  the  speakers  spoke  of  the  bombing  in  Finland  and  the  assassination  of  Pym  Fonteyn  in  Holland,  as  if  they  too  were  due  to   Islamic  terrorists.   That  day  I  heard  that  the  bomb  in  Finland  was  set  off  by  a  Finnish  university  student,  not  an  Islamic   terrorist.   As  far  as  the  Holland  assassina  tion  was  concerned,  it  was  a  Dutch  animal  liberationist  who   assassinated  the  right-wing  politi  cian  —  not  an  Islamic  assassin.   It  is  intolerance  and  prejudice  we  should  fear,  not  Islam.   It  was  only  one  of  the  four  speakers,  and  it  seemed  a  minori  ty  of  the  audience,  at  Hakoah  that  showed  the  land  of  compassion,  sense  of  justice  and  depth  of  insight  that  the  two  Islamic  speak  ers  were  demonstrating  at  Temple   Emanuel.   Perhaps  next  time  they  could  be  invited  to  a  talk  called  “Should  we  fear  intolerance?”   Because  that  is  what  many  peo  ple  in  that  audience,  as  in  the  wider  community,  are  showing  towards  Muslims  at  this  time,  whether  they  are  asylum  seekers   or  Muslim  Australians.

"  jNews   Insults  hurled  as  Einfeld   urges  dialogue  with  moderates   Aviva  Bard  and   Peta  Jones  Pellach   A  DEBATE  on  Islam  was  almost  ter  minated  last  week  when  insults  were  hurled  at  Justice  Marcus  Einfeld  by  members  of  the  500-strong  Hakoah  Club  audience.   The  judge  —  who  received  a  United  Nations  Peace  Award  from  the  Governor-General  in  Melbourne  last  week—was  accused  of  being  a  “trai  tor”  to  the  Jewish  community,  and  contradicted  with  interjections  of  “rubbish”  and  “bull****”.   An  internationally-regarded  human  rights  activist,  Justice  Einfeld  was  participating  in  a  Jewish  Free  University  forum  on  “Should  we  fear  Islam?”   With  groans  and  interruptions  punctuating  his  speech,  he  pointed  out  that  the  West  had  armed  some  of  the  most  brutal  Muslim  regimes  —  it  armed  Iraq  during  the  Iran-Iraq  war,  it  backs  despotism  in  Saudi  Arabia  and  it  supports  Kuwait,  where  women  are  not  even  permitted  to  drive.   There  cannot  be  a  solution  to  Muslim  extremism  without  first  engaging  Muslim  moderates  in  dia  logue  and  enabling  regime  change  to  occur  organically  —  from  within  the   Muslim  communities  themselves,  Justice  Einfeld  said.   He  said  mosques  eveiywhere  had  been  attacked  and  “Muslims  every  where  have  suffered.  We  should  help  good  Muslims  in  their  struggle.”   Members  of  the  audience  were   angered  when  he  said  that  Islamic  terms  such  as  “jihad”  were  misunder  stood  by  the  West,  and  that  Hamas  provides  welfare  programs.   ""There  is  a  difference   between  robust  debate  and   outright  rudeness.""   “We  should  educate  ourselves  with  the  principles  of  the  Islamic  reli  gion,”  he  continued.  “Antipathy  and  misrepresentation  are  based  on  lack  of  education!”   He  advocated  that  “the  future  of  humanity  be  built  on  dialogue,  toler  ance  and  understanding”  —  again  prompting  ire  from  the  audience.   Rejecting  any  similarity  between  the  threats  posed  by  Nazism  and  extremist  Islam,  he  said  the  need  to  eliminate  Nazism  resulted  in  the  destruction  of  Germany.   Clearly,  it  was  not  feasible  to   Alan  Gold,  Professor  Raphael  Israeli,  Peta  Jones  Pellach,  Professor  Sol  Encel,  Yalr  Miller,  Dr  Leanne  Piggott,  Justice  Marcus  □nfeld.   destroy  one  billion  Muslims  in  order  to  deal  with  the  threat  from  Muslim  extremists,  he  argued.   Moderator  Alan  Gold,  who  threat  ened  to  close  the  meeting  when  Justice  Einfeld  was  booed,  said  after  wards  that  “there  is  a  difference  between  robust  debate  and  outright  rudeness  and  obscenities.  I  couldn’t  allow  the  debate  to  get  out  of  hand.”   Justice  Einfeld—who  is  the  found  ing  president  of  Australia’s  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunity  Commission  —  later  commented  to  the  Australian  Jewish  News:  “I  don’t  respond  to  intolerant,  ignorant  peo  ple  who  don’t  want  to  listen.  My  record  will  stand  up  in  front  of  those  who  hide  behind  anonymity.   “The  evening  was  revealing  for  the  enormous  differences  of  views  peo  ple  have  on  this  emotive  subject.  It  was  heartwarming  that  there  was  enormous  support  for  the  tolerance  and  understanding  I  put  forward.   “Accommodation  must  be  reached  between  civilisations  because  the  alternative  is  too  horrifying  to  con  template.  My  experience  with  Muslims  in  15-20  countries  is  that  they  can’t  all  be  tarred  with  the  same  brush,  anymore  than  Jews  can  be.   “I  agree  with  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  that  this  is  not  a  time  for  vengeance  or  intolerance,  but  for  understanding  and  co-operation.”   Panellist  Dr  Leanne  Piggott  drew  a  parallel  between  Germans  in  the  1930s  “who  did  not  speak  out  and  were  silent  because  they  had  a  deep  sense  of  victimhood  themselves”  and  “the  paralysis  of  Muslims  who  oppose  violence  and  terrorism  but  do  nothing  or  say  nothing”.   Professor  Raphael  Israeli  of  the  Hebrew  University  of  Jerusalem  rejected  any  tolerance  of  violence.   He  criticised  what  he  said  was  mis  use  of  the  term  “suicide  bomber”  and  urged  that  it  be  replaced  with   “Islamikaze”.

"  Bridging  Ihe  divide,  learning  to  appreciate  Islam   Alien  Lee   DIALOGUE  between  peoples  of  different  faiths  is  vital  in  preventing  misunderstandings  and  hatred,  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  told  a  gathering  at  the  Gazi  Husrevbeg  Mosque  in  Sydney  last  week.   He  was  speaking  at  the  launch  of  an  infor  mation  booldet  on  Islam  published  by  the  peak  Muslim  representative  body,  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  (AFIC).   Titled  Appreciating  Islam,  the  publication  answers  basic  questions  on  Islam.  Its  release  follows  in  the  wake  of  September  11,  2001  and  the  realisation  of  a  need  to  explain  Muslim  beliefs  and  customs,  AFIC  vice-president  Abbas  Ahmed  said.   Recounting  the  ECAJ’s  recent  victory  in  Federal  Court,  in  which  it  successfully  used  Australia’s  racial  vilification  laws  to  restrain  Tasmanian  Olga  Scully  from  distributing  hate  ful  literature,  Mr  Jones  said  the  goal  of  pre  venting  sections  of  the  Australian  community  turning  against  one  another  was  not  easy.   “There  is  a  red  line  that  cannot  be  crossed.  Courts  are  one  area  for  dealing  with  racism,  but  the  first  resort  is  engagement  between  peoples  from  all  backgrounds.”   Commending  the  choice  of  mosque  to  launch  the  pamphlet,  Mr  Jones  said  its  histori  cal  namesake,  Gazi  Husrevbeg,  was  a  16th  cen  tury  Bosnian  Muslim  ruler  who  encouraged  thousands  of  Jews  to  settle  in  Sarajevo  after  the  expulsion  from  Spain  during  the  Inquisition  of  1492.   Mr  Jones  said  he  was  hopeful  that  the  book  let  would  enable  “we  non-Muslims  to  get  to  see  how  Muslims  understand  themselves,  which  is  vital  if  we  want  to  understand  how  to  get  along   better”.   Mr  Ahmed  acknowledged  that  Australian  Muslims  had  been  poor  advocates  of  their  reli  gion  to  the  wider  community,  despite  building  large  numbers  of  mosques  over  the  years.   Describing  Muslims  as  “a  peaceful,  tolerant  and  loving  community”,  he  pointed  out  that  ARC  had  condemned  the  September  11  attacks  immediately.  “No  matter  what  the  aim,  the  Koran  says  it  is  totally  unlawful  to  use  ter  ror,”  he  said.   Praising  the  non-Muslim  Brisbane  commu  nity  in  Kuraby,  who  helped  to  extinguish  an  arson  attack  on  a  mosque  following  the  September  11  attack  on  the  US,  Mr  Ahmed  recounted  how  Christian  children  had  willing  ly  handed  over  lunch  money  for  the  rebuilding   fund.   “We  should  learn  this  lesson  from  kids  who  are  innocent  of  politics.”   Thanking  Mr  Jones  for  his  work  in  forming  partnerships  with  AFIC  “to  break  down  misun  derstandings  between  the  two  communities”,  Mr  Ahmed  said  Australia  could  export  lessons  in  harmony  to  the  rest  of  the  world.   Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  Gary  Hargraves  praised  the  booklet  as  important  for  those  who  “don’t  understand  to  understand”.   “It  is  all  about  getting  to  know  each  other.  We  do  have  a  common  unity  of  purpose,”  he  told  the  gathering.   Controversial  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hilaly  —  who  in  1988  described  Jews  as  “the  underlying  cause  of  all  wars”  and  accused  them  of  trying  to  control  the  world—warned  that  “the  world  will  be  destroyed”  unless  politicians  stop  using  religion  as  a  political  tool.   He  called  on  Australians  to  love  one  anoth  er,  saying  everyone  would  be  happy  “when  we  walk  together  behind  the  koala  and  the  kanga   roo”.

"  Rabbi,  sheikh  join  the  NSW  thin  blue  line   Aviva  Bard   IN  a  coup  for  multiculturalism,  a  rabbi  and  a  sheikh  were  inducted  as   chaplains  of  the  NSW  Police  in  an  unprecedented  joint  ceremony  last   week.   Great  Synagogue  Rabbi  Mendel  Kastel  and  Penshurst  Mosque  Sheikh  Khalil  Chami  were  installed  at  the  Surry  Hills  Police  Centre  in  the  presence  of  Police  Minister  Michael  Costa  and  NSW  Police  Commissioner  Ken  Moroney.   Senior  Police  Chaplain  Father  Jim  Boland  said  the  first-ever  combined  ceremony  was  the  result  of  the  growing  numbers  of  Jewish  and  Muslim  police  officers  serving  in  NSW,  although  official  figures  are  not  kept.   Rabbi  Kastel  and  Sheikh  Chami  join  about  90  honorary  part-time  (and  five  full-time)  police  chaplains.   Lebanese-born  Sheikh  Chami  is  the  first  Muslim  leader  to  join  the   NSW  Police.   New  York-born  Rabbi  Kastel  replaces  Great  Synagogue  Senior  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple,  but  is  no  stranger  to  the  police,  having  served  as  a  chaplain  to  Jewish  athletes  during  the  Sydney  Olympic   Games.   “The  NSW  Police  is  growing  in  diversity  and  is  the  fourth-largest  police  entity  in  the  world  after  New  York,  Los  Angeles  and  London,”  Commissioner  Moroney  said.   “It  is  opportune  that  the  chaplaincy  is  joined  by  representatives  of  the  Islamic  and   Police  Senior  Chaplain  Reverend  Graeme  Dark  (left)  inducts  Rabbi  Mendel  Kastel  as  Jewish  chaplain  of  the  NSW  Police.

He  lost  little  time  illustrating  what  he  meant  when  he  explained  the  significance  of  the  lulav  and  etrog  during  his   acceptance  speech  as  the  induction  occurred  during  Succot.   Commented  Sheikh  Chami,  who  has  been  in  Australia  for  39  years:  “I  will  do  all  I  can  to  improve  relations  between  the  Muslim  people  and  all  other  citizens  of  the  state.   “I  am  proud  to  be  part  of  history.

"  Muslims.  8.30pm  Sunday  September  8,  SBS  TV   Islam  continues  to  be  one  of  the  fastest  growing  religions  around  the  world.  Muslims  accountfor  one-fifth  of  the  world's  population,  but  most  Westerners  know  little  about  thatfaith.  What  does  it  mean  to  be  a  Muslim  today?  Does  Islam  deserve  its  reputation  as  a  patriarchal,  authoritarian,  and  anti-Western  religion?  What  is  the  role  of  Islam  in  movements  for  political  and  social  change?  On  Sunday  September  8  at  8.30pm,  SBS  Television  will  screen  the  first  episode  of  the  two-part  documentary  series  Muslims.  The  series  will  attempt  to  explore  these  and  other  questions.  It  draws  on   reports  from  Iran,  Nigeria,  Egypt,  Malaysia,  Turkey  and  the  United  States  and  interviews  leading  scholars  of  Islam.  Moreinformationontheseries  can  be  found  at  www.pbs.ora/wobh/  paaes/fronline/shows/muslims/  The  series  begins  at  Cairo's  Al  Azhar  Mosque,  the  oldest  extant  university  in  the  world.  SheikMuawith  Mabrook  Abbas,  an  Islamic  scholar,  staffs  the  phones  of  Al  Azhar's  Fatwa  Committee,  responding  to  Muslims  wanting  to  know  what  is  right  and  wrong  under  Islamic  (or  Sharia)  law.  The  sheik  encourages  Muslims  to  hold  fast  to  the  traditions  of  Islam.  Butthe  influence  of  Islamic  institutions  such  as  Al  Azhar  has  waned,  while   daily  pressures  have  risen,  and  people  have  been  forced  to  look  elsewhere  for  guidance.  For  some,  the  answer  has  been  in  more  traditional  interpretations  of  Islam,  while  for  others  it  is  in  a  more  contemporary  understanding  oftheir  faith.  Modernity,  globalisation  and  immigration  are  proving  to  be  key  fault  lines  for  Muslims  everywhere,  astheireffectsforce  manyto  redefine  their  faith  and  its  place  in  their  daily  lives.  And  howdo  American  Muslims  define  their  Islamic  culture  and  identity  in  the  open,  multicultural  society  of  the  United  States?  For  years,  Muslims  have  been  learning   howto  carve  outaMuslim  identity  in  a  diverse  society.  However,  particularly  since  September  11,  they  also  have  had  to  face  confrontations  with  other  ethnic  and  religious  groups.  Muslims  traces  the  stories  of  several  Americans,  including  Yasemin  Saib,  a  New  York  City  marketing  professional  who  was  raised  in  Saudi  Arabia,  and  DrAminah  McCloud,  an  African-American  convert  to  Islam  who  works  not  only  to  resolve  misunderstandings  between  American  Muslimsand  non-  Muslims,  but  also  to  improve  relations  between  African-American  Muslims  and  Muslim  immigrants.

"  LA  schools  yank  copies  of  Koran   Tom  Tugend   LOS  ANGELES  —  Hundreds  of  copies  of  the  Koran  have  been  removed  from  California  schools  because  of  an  accompanying  antisemitic  commentary.   School  board  officials  in  Los  Angeles  removed  the  translations  of  the  Muslim  holy  book  —  which  were  donated  to  schools  by  a  local  Muslim  foundation  to  pro  mote  religious  understanding  fol  lowing  the  September  11  terror  attacks  —  after  a  history  teacher  noted  the  derogatory  commen  tary  in  footnotes  to  the  text.   One  passage  in  the  commen  tary  calls  Jews  “men  without  faith”.  Another  footnote  says  of  Jews:  “Many  of  them,  even  if  they  could  read,  were  no  better  than  illiterates  for  they  knew  not  their  own  true  scriptures,  but  read  into  them  what  they  wanted,  or  at  best  their  own  conjecture.”   Copies  of  The  Meaning  of  the  Holy  Quran  were  donated  to  the  Los  Angeles  Unified  School  District  by  the  Omar  Ibn  Khattab   Foundation.   For  unknown  reasons,  the  books  were  distributed  to  school  libraries  last  week  without  under  going  the  customary  content  review,  said  Jim  Konantz,  director  of  information  technology  for  the  Los  Angeles  school  district.   After  the  teacher  complained,  Konantz  instructed  principals  to  secure  all  copies  in  their  offices  pending  a  review.

"  He’s  Shimmy,   ami  te’s  Jewish   LOOKING  for  something   more  kosher  than  Barbie   and  Ken?  A  Tel  Aviv  compa  ny  has  the  answer.   Shimmy  is  the  first  Jewish  doll  —  observant,  even.   “We  started  with  a  boy  because  of  the  fact  that  girls  have  chests,”  says  market  ing  director  Budi  Dvir.   The  37.5cm  toy  is  unlike  other  dolls.  To  adhere  to  the  Ten  Commandments’  ban  on   making  “graven  images”,  he  has  chubby  cheeks,  a  little  button  nose  and  four  fingers   on  each  hand  instead  of  five.   When  you  squeeze  one  of  Shimmy’s  hands,  he  recites  the  Shema;  squeeze  the  other  and  he  says  Mode  Ani.   “Shimmy  is  built  around  Jewish  law,”  said  Dvir.  “Religious  children  need  a  character  to  identify  with.”   Sales  have  taken  off.  “I  just  can’t  get  enough  stocks,”  says  Shalom  Halpern,  a  toyshop  owner  in  an  Orthodox  neighbourhood  of   Jerusalem.   “When  I  first  got  it,  I  was  sceptical.  But  people  just  keep  buying.”   However,  Shimmy  has  competition  from  the  Arab   world  in  the  form  of  Dara  and  Sara.  The  two  Muslim  dolls  have  been  developed  by  an  Iranian  Government  agency  to  promote  tradition   al  values.   Dara  and  Sara  are  clad  in   modest  clothing;  Sara  never  goes  out  without  a  headscarf  or  unaccompanied  by  her  brother,  Dara.

"  Chaplains  mass  at  tempo  talk   By  Graham  Davis   The  increase  in  operational  tempo  for  ADF  person  nel  has  made  the  role  of  Defence  chaplains  and  padres  even  more  important.  This  is  the  message,  which  emerged  from  informal   discussions  amongst  45  tri  service  clergymen  who  attended  a  three-day  conference  at  HMAS  Penguin  last  month.  The  chaplains  and  padres  were  drawn  from  ships  and  establishments  around  NSW  and  the  ACT.  One  of  the  aims  was  to  enhance  the  links  between  the  clergy  of  the  three  services.

"  News   Islamic  website  article  claims  ‘State  of  the  Jews  will  perish’   Bernard  FMman   AN  Islamic  Youth  Movement  maga  zine  which  publishes  articles  pro  moting  hatred  of  Israel,  Jews  and  Christians  and  incites  Islamic  youth  to  realise  that  “Jihad  is  the  only  path  to  establish  the  Islamic  state”  has  ignored  a  call  from  Australia’s  Islamic  peak  body  to  close  its  web   site.   Among  the  articles  that  Nida’ul  Islam  —  The  Call  of  Islam  includes  on  its  website  www.isIam.org.au  is  one  that  interprets  the  Koran  as  calling  for  the  “termination  of  Israel”  and  the  killing  of  Jews.   Others  feature  interviews  with  terrorist  mastermind  Osama  bin  Laden,  alleged  Jemaah  Islamiah  founder  Abdullah  Sungkar,  Omar  Abdul  Rahman  —  imprisoned  in  the  US  for  his  role  in  the  1993  bombing   of  the  World  Trade  Centre  —  and  Hamas  founder  Sheikh  Ahmed  Yasine.   The  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  called  for  the  Sydney-based  website  to  be  closed  two  weeks  ago,  but  the  site  was  still  operating  this  week,  Muslim  leaders  reportedly  saying  while  they  disap  proved  of  some  of  its  material,  the   youth  group  was  unrepresentative  and  entitled  to  free  speech.   Established  in  1994,  the  magazine  has  among  its  goals  “reflecting  the  views  of  the  Jihad  stream  amongst  the  Islamic  movements”  and  “stand  ing  up  to  the  Zionist-Crusade  assaults  against  Islam”.   An  interview  with  bin  Laden,  pub  lished  originally  in  the  magazine’s  October-November  1996  issue,  recalled  that  he  “has  directed  a  call  to  the  Muslims  throughout  the  world  to  declare  a  jihad  against  the  Judeo  Christian  alliance  which  is  occupy  ing  Islamic  sacred  land  in  Palestine  and  the  Arabian  Peninsula”.   It  added:  “The  evidence  over  whelmingly  shows  America  and  Israel  killing  the  weaker  men,  women  and  children  in  the  Muslim  world  and  elsewhere”.   A  history  of  “Palestine”  says  a  “truce  with  the  country  of  Israel...  is  not  permitted  by  law  ...  Jihad  with  iron  and  fire  is  the  only  way  to  reclaim  Palestine  from  the  hands  of  the  Jews  and  to  return  it  to  the  rule  of  Islam”.   An  article  headed  “The  Termination  of  ‘israel’:  a  Qur’anic  fact”  said  “sacred  verses”  indicate   that  believers  are  promised  victory   when  “they  arm  themselves  with  steeds  of  war”  to  fight  for  Allah.  “Thereafter  the  State  of  the  Jews  will  perish.”   The  Islamic  Youth  Movement,  in  a  statement  added  to  its  website  since  newspapers  drew  attention  to  the  articles,  denied  that  the  inter  views  with  bin  Laden  and  other   extremists  “classify  our  magazine  as   extreme”.   The  statement  accused  the  media   of  using  Australia’s  grief  over  Bali  “to   fuel  hatred  of  Muslims”.   “Nida’ul  Islam  is  an  independent  publication  with  no  ties  with  any  international  Islamic  groups,”  it  said.  “The  aim  of  the  magazine  is  to  pro   vide  access  to  its  readers  with  unbi  ased  information  otherwise  unavailable  in  the  mainstream  media.

"  International   f   Canadian  Jews  protest  Arafat  Christmas  card   Bram  Eisenthal   MONTREAL  —  A  Quebec-based  member  of  Canada’s  Parliament  has  drawn  the  ire  of  Canadian  Jews  and  many  Christians  for  sending  constituents  a  Christmas  card  fea  turing  Yasser  Arafat.   Legislator  Jean-Guy  Carignan  had  his  picture  taken  with  the  Palestinian  Authority  Chairman  in  May,  when  Carignan  visited  Ramallah  with  other  Canadian  politicians  on  a  trip  paid  for  by  the   Toronto-based  Palestine  House.   He  used  the  photo  as  the  front  of  the  Christmas  card  he  sent  this  year  to  2000  constituents.  Though  Carignan  says  he  is  “in  favour  of  peace  and  justice”  in  the  Middle  East,  Jewish  groups  are  angered  by  what  they  see  as  a  misjudgment  at  best,  and  a  provocation  at  worst.   “We  know  that  Arafat  opera  tives  have  claimed  responsibility  for  numerous  acts  of  terror  against  civilians,”  said  the  national  presi  dent  of  B’nai  Brith  Canada,  Rochelle  Wilner.  “Arafat  is  the  one  who  says  to  them,  ‘Go  out  and  do  your  suicide  bombings.’  Where  is  the  peace  in  that?   “To  show  yourself  pho  tographed  with  him  at  this  time  of  year,  in  a  message  of  peace  to  your  constituents,  is  absolutely  outra  geous,”  she  added.   Joseph  Gabay,  president  of  the   Canadian  Jewish  Congress,  also  was  upset.  “I  am  angry  that  our  [tax]  money  is  being  used  to  send  a  biased  message  like  this,”  Gabay  said.  “This  is  an  awful  message  of  peace.”   Christian  callers  to  local  radio  talk  shows  also  were  incensed  by  Carignan’s  card.  “What  does  a  Yasser  Arafat,  a  Muslim,  have  to  do  with  the  celebration  of  Christmas?”  one  caller  asked.  “And  I  am  against  politicians  using  this  important  holiday  to  further  their  political  causes.  This  has  nothing  to  do  with  peace.”   ""What  does  a  Yasser  Arafat,   a  Muslim,  have  to  do  with  the   celebration  of  Christmas?”   A  Christian  caller  to  talk-back  radio   Carignan,  61,  was  a  Quebec  provincial  bureaucrat  in  2000  when  he  ran  for  a  seat  in  the  federal  Parliament  for  the  Liberal  Party,  narrowly  defeating  the  incumbent.   Carignan  represents  a  mainly  French-speaking  district  near  Quebec  City  with  virtually  no  Jews.  A  member  of  the  Canada-Israel  Parliamentary  Association,  he  pointed  out  that  he  recently  attended  a  Chanukah  party  thrown  by  Israel’s  ambassador  to  Canada,  Haim  Divon.

"  TWO  weeks  ago,  we  read  of  Justice  Einfeld’s  plea  not  to  paint  all  Mus  lims  with  the  extremist  brush.   Last  week,  Donna  Jacobs  Sife  propagated  the  same  view,  and   lamented  the  resistance  she  too  encountered  to  this  viewpoint.   Revealingly,  we  also  read  last  week  of  the  Islamic  Youth  Move  ment’s  failure  to  shut  its  inflamma  tory  website.   Some  Islamic  leaders  were  report  ed  as  saying  that  while  they  “disap  prove  of  some  of  the  material,  they  have  a  right  to  freedom  of  speech”.   These  “good  men  do  nothing”  when  they  should  be  denouncing  terrorism  in  the  most  unequivocal  manner,  expressing  outrage  at  the  fundamentalist  views  of  some  of  their  co-religionists  —  outrage  that  would  effectively  separate  their  moderate  selves  from  the  extrem  ism  of  some  of  their  brothers.   Instead,  some  Muslim  leaders  in  Australia  reportedly  defend  the  rights  to  free  speech  of  this  “unrep  resentative”  youth  group.  Oh  and  they  also  “disapproved”  of  some  of   its  material.  I  fear  this  inexplicable   silence.   I  scan  the  letters  pages  of  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald  looking  for  moderate  Muslims  denouncing  the  terrorist  activities  of  Islamic  extremists  —  reassurance  that  the  majority  of  Muslims  are  not  repre  sented  by  the  actions  and  speech  of  their  vocal  fundamentalist  broth   ers.   Alas,  so  far,  I  have  only  seen  such  assurances  from  much  respected,  much  loved,  but  not   much  Muslim  Justice  Einfeld  and  Donna  Jacobs  Sife.   Ms  Jacobs  Sife  assures  us  that  “Justice  Einfeld  spoke  of  the  Mus  lims  he  knew”.  How  many  would  that  be?  12?  100?  How  is  this  per  sonal  reference  reassuring?   Where  among  the  400,000  Aus  tralian  Muslims  is  the  representa  tive  voice  of  moderation  against  which  we  can  balance  the  calls  “to  Muslims  throughout  the  world  to  declare  a  jihad  against  the  Judeo  Christian  alliance”;  to  balance  the  Islamic  voice  that  “interprets  the  Koran  as  calling  for  the  “termina  tion  of  Israel”  (AJN1/11/02)?   This  woodcutter  has  listened  for  the  voice  of  the  neighbour’s  son;  thus  far  it  has  remained  weak  and  all  but  inaudible.  I  am  not  reassured  when  Justice  Einfeld  and  Donna  Sife  speak  for  him.   As  much  as  their  humanitarian  sympathies  are  acknowledged,  it  seems  that  either  I’m  reading  the  wrong  newspapers  or  Justice  Ein  feld  and  Ms  Jacobs  Sife  need  a  real  ity  check.

"  Call  for  worldwide  jihad   THE  spiritual  leader  of  Hamas  called  on  Muslims  around  the  world  to  launch  a  holy  war  to  lib  erate  their  countries  from  US  influ  ence.  “Sons  of  Islam  everywhere,  the  jihad  is  a  duty,  to  establish  the  rule  of  Allah  on  earth  and  to  liber  ate  your  countries  and  yourselves  from  America’s  domination  and  its  Zionist  allies,”  Sheik  Ahmed  Yassin  said  in  an  open  letter.

"  6.6  million  Israelis,  but  the  Jewish  growth  rate  is  slowest   JERUSALEM  —  At  the  dawn  of  the  new  year  5763,  the  population  of  Israel  stands  at  almost  6.6  million  —  but  its  Jewish  population  contin  ues  to  grow  at  a  slower  pace  than  that  of  its  Muslim,  Christian  and  Druse  communities.   According  to  figures  released  by  the  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics,  Israel’s  population  was  6,592,000  at  the  end  of  2001  —  2.1  per  cent  higher  (133,000  people)  than  the  year  before.   The  Jewish  population  grew  by  only  1.4  per  cent  in  2001,  compared  to  1.8  per  cent  from  1997-2000  and  3.4  per  cent  from  1990-1995.   Israel’s  Muslim  population  grew  by  3.6  per  cent,  down  from  3.7-3.8  per  cent  over  the  pre  vious  three  years.  The  Christian  population  increased  by  2.5  per  cent  and  the  Druse  popu  lation  by  2.3  per  cent.   Jews  account  for  77.2  per  cent  of  the  nation’s  population,  falling  from  77.8  per  cent  the  previous  year  and  78.6  per  cent  in  1999.   Muslims  make  up  15.4  per  cent  of  the  popu  lation,  up  from  15.2  per  cent  in  2000.  Christians  account  for  2.1  per  cent  of  the  population,  fol  lowed  by  Druse  at  1.6  per  cent.   A  28  per  cent  plunge  in  immigration  last  year,  compared  to  2000,  was  the  main  reason  for  the  drop  in  Jewish  population  growth.  Only  43,600  arrived,  the  least  since  1989,  when  the  massive  Russian  exodus  began.   The  figure  does  not  include  immigrants  arriving  under  the  Law  of  Return,  but  classified   as  non-Jewish.   About  20,000  people  left  the  country  in  2001  for  a  prolonged  period.   Approximately  3.5  per  cent  of  the  popula  tion  has  no  religious  classification  —  a  0.4  per   cent  increase  over  the  previous  year.   The  average  life  expectancy  is  77  for  Israeli   men  and  81  for  women.   Israel  is  one  of  the  most  densely  populated  countries  in  the  world,  with  an  average  of  294  people  per  square  kilometre.   The  Tel  Aviv  region  had  the  highest  con  centration  —  6788  per  square  kilometre.   Jerusalem  had  only  1192  residents  per  square  kilometre,  but  that  is  likely  to  rise  as  its  population  grew  12  per  cent  last  year.   Jerusalem  Post,  JTA ",2002-09-13
"  The  healing  power  of  Seven  s  eight  musicians   Aviva  Banfl   REMINISCENT  of  The  Beatles’   Magical  Mystery  Tour  of  the  1960s,  Israel’s  mystical  band  Sheva  will  per  form  a  series  of  concerts  along  Australia’s  east  coast  next  month,  bringing  a  powerful  message.   Comprising  eight  members  (there  used  to  be  seven,  hence  the  name)  —  six  Israelis,  a  Muslim  Israeli-Arab  and  a  Christian-Arab  —  the  band  is  inspired  by  the  quest  for  peace,  striv  ing  to  accomplish  reconciliation  not  only  between  Israelis  and  Palestinians,  but  for  all  humanity,  both  through  its  music  and  tangible  programs.   “It’s  you  and  I  who  can  heal  the  world,”  band  member  Amir  Paiss,  36,  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  on  the  eve  of  the  group’s  Australian   tour.   “I  think  that  as  a  musical  ensem   ble  that  incorporates  both  Hebrew  and  Arab  traditions  and  works  with  Arab,  Christian  and  Muslim  musi  cians,  it  sends  a  very  strong  message  to  our  listeners  —  that  co-existence  is  possible.”   Combining  Hebrew,  Arabic  and  various  tribal  cultures,  the  band’s  chants  are  set  to  music  created  by  a  variety  of  unusual  and  eclectic  instruments,  including  the  Persian  santur,  the  sitar,  the  Persian  tar,  the  didgeridoo  and  the  ney  (a  Middle  Eastern  flute).   Meeting  each  other  at  various  global  rainbow  music  festivals,  the  band  members  gravitated  towards  the  Galilee  in  the  summer  of  1996,  deciding  to  produce  a  CD  together.   Their  popularity  quickly  extended  beyond  Israel’s  borders,  and  the  band  received  an  invitation  to  play  before  the  Dalai  Lama  as  part  of  a  sacred  music  festival  in  Los  Angeles  in  1999.   “Music  is  a  very  powerful  medi  um,”  said  Paiss,  the  band’s  song  writer,  composer  and  player  of  the  santur  and  the  ney.  “In  times  of  trou  ble,  music  can  have  a  very  soothing  effect.”   Seven  of  the  eight  members  of  Sheva.  The  band  recently  performed  for  the  Dalai  Lama.   Receiving  blessings  from  both  the  Palestinian  Authority  and  former  Israeli  Deputy  Foreign  Minister  Rabbi  Michael  Melchior,  the  band  mem  bers  have  become  involved  in  a  rec  onciliation  program  between  Israelis   and  Palestinians.   “We  facilitate  reconciliation  in   Israel  and  participate  in  reconcilia  tion  meetings  between  Arabs,  Jews  and  Christians,”  Paiss  said.   “Before  we  start  talking,  we  eat  and  dance  together,  and  then  after  we  have  experienced  something  with  each  other,  then  we  talk  in  small  groups  and  allow  people  to  express  their  pain  because  the  situation  is  very  painful.   “Peace  is  not  a  luxury,”  he  empha  sised.  “It’s  not  something  we  can  sit  and  think  about  whether  we  can  afford  it  or  not;  it’s  a  must.   “It’s  a  basic  human  need,  and  we  have  to  work  and  strive  for  that.  It  takes  a  lot  of  compassion,  tolerance  and  patience.”   The  title  of  one  of  Sheva’s  num  bers  is  a  prayer  which  serves  as  a  testament  to  the  ensemble’s  world  view.   Entitled  SOS  and  composed  in  col  laboration  with  Muslim  and  Buddhist  artists,  the  title  is  an  acronym  for  Shalom,  Om  and  Salaam  —  chanted  in  Hebrew,  Arabic  and  Sanskrit.   Citing  The  Beatles,  Mozart,  Led   Zeppelin,  Pink  Floyd  and  “everything  in  between”  as  his  musical  inspira  tions,  Paiss  was  passionate  about  the   band’s  raison  d’etre:   “Through  celebration  we  achieve  transformation.  It’s  a  gift  we  share  and  it  has  a  huge  effect  on  human  beings.   “Maybe  if  the  politicians  listen  to  music  with  one  another  before  they  sit  around  the  table  to  talk,  maybe  they  will  reach  better  results.   “There  is  a  minority  of  people  who  create  the  violence  and  there  is  a  minority  of  people  like  us  who  are  working  actively  for  peace.   “But  the  majority  of  people  are  sit  ting  and  don’t  know  what  to  do.  There  is  a  lot  of  fear  in  the  air,  and  it  paraly   ses  them.  The  most  important  thing  is  not  to  be  silent.”   Brought  to  Australia  by  tp  events  producer  Danny  Yezersky,  Sheva  is  due  to  perform  at  Brisbane’s  Woodford  Folk  Festival  on  New  Year’s  Eve,  winding  their  way  to  Sydney  to  perform  at  the  Metro  on  January  9  and  then  at  Melbourne’s  Prince  Hotel  on  January  15.   “I’ve  brought  out  a  lot  of  different  groups  from  Israel  and  around  the  world  for  events,  but  this  is  something  unique,”  said  Yezersky.   “It’s  a  special  and  different  voice  in  the  Middle  East.  If  they’re  good  enough  for  the  Dalai  Lama,  then  they’re  good  enough  for  me.” ",2002-12-27

Previous  interactions  between  the  Muslim  and  Jewish  groups  on  cam  pus  have  been  marked  by  hostility.  In  gestures  meant  as  both  signs  of  peace  and  recognition  of  the  seven  people  killed  and  dozens  wounded  in  the  Jerusalem  attack,  arum  lilies  were  scattered  over  part  of  the  university’s  Jameson  Plaza,  and  white  roses  and  daisies  were  handed  out  to  passing   students.   Students  put  up  fliers  and  posters  bearing  the  legends  “Some  people  wake  up  in  the  morning,  some  people  wake  up  to  mourning”,  and  “Stand  united  as  students  against  terrorism  on  our  campuses”.   The  campus  chaplain,  Rabbi  Jonathan  Shippel,  called  for  a  moment  of  silence  at  the  service,  then  delivered  an  interdenomination   al  message  calling  for  union  on  cam  pus  so  that  terrorism  and  suffering  should  not  hit  students  here.  His  call  met  with  resounding  cheers  from  the  300  students  present.   Speaking  at  the  gathering,  first  year  law  student  Jeremy  Raizon,  a  spokesman  for  the  South  African  Union  of  Jewish  Students  (SAUJS),   said  students  “need  to  make  our  voic  es  heard,  to  say  that  we  are  the  future  and  we  cannot  tolerate  any  act  of  vio   lence  or  terror”.   Afterwards,  Raizon  said  Muslim  students  who  approached  SAUJS  about  attending  the  event  had  expressed  concern  about  the  possi  ble  stereotyping  of  Muslims  as  terror   ists.   ""[Students]  need  to  make  our  voices  heard,  to  say  that  we  are  the  future  and  we  cannot   tolerate  any  act  of  violence  or  terror.”   Jeremy  Raizon,  spokesman,  South  African  Union  of  Jewish  Students   “We  assured  them  that  this  would  not  happen  and  that  this  was  about  the  rights  of  students,  not  Muslims  or  Jews,”  he  said.   “The  fact  that  SAUJS  included  all  students  on  campus  in  this  campaign  gave  us  the  chance  to  enhance  our  relationship  with  the  [university’s  Islamic  Society]  who  approached  us  afterwards  to  say  that  they  would  like  to  work  with  us  on  functions  such  as  these  in  the  future,”  Raizon  said.

"  Imran  Kahn:  Islam  and  America  -  Tuesday,  15  th  January  at  8.00  pm  on  SBS  TV   An  investigation  by  former  Pakistani  cricketer  turned  politician,  Imran  Kahn,  into  the  reasons  for  the  widespread  hatred  by  Muslims  of  the  US  and  the  alienation  in  the  Muslim  world  to  America's  actions  since  September  11.  At  Islamabad  Women's  College,  a  concert  for  peace  is  taking  place.  The  students  are  mainly  from  privileged,  middle  class  backgrounds,  a  socioeconomic  group  which  could  be  expected  to  sympathise  with  the  West,  But  even  here,  amongst  the  more  liberal  ""Westernised""  Pakistanis,  anti-American  feeling  is  running  high.  ""It's  as  if  one  white  life  was  far  more  important  than  thousands  of  black  or  brown  lives,""  one  young,  educated,  middle  class  woman  tells  Khan.  ""They  feel  they  can  basically  come  in,  use  as  they  please,  and  then,  when  they  want,  they  can  just  walk  across  the  border,  go  somewhere  else,  and  do  exactly  as  they  please  there,""  complains  another.  In  Peshawar,  anti-war  demonstrators  fill  the  streets.  They  are  driven  by  a  sense  of  justice  that  is  a  fundamental  aspect  of  the  Koran.  America  may  be  the  most  powerful  country  in  the  world,  but  Kahn  found  that  the   feeling  here  is  that  this  does  not  give  it  the  right  to  act  as  judge,  jury  and  executioner.  As  far  as  the  international  press  is  concerned,  there  seems  to  be  a  lot  more  mileage  in  stories  emphasising  the  extremes  and  differences  between  cultures,  instead  of  the  things  they  have  in  common.  The  result  is  often  a  misunderstanding  about  the  true  nature  of  Islam.  According  to  the  program,  for  many  Pakistanis,  Islam  has  given  them  a  direction  in  life,  helping  them  to  come  to  terms  with  their  harsh,  often  poverty-stricken  reality.  In  this  part  of  the  world,  the  spectre  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  looms  large  and  everyone  -  rich  or  poor  -  is  familiar  with  the  organisation.  ""The  IMF  is  America.  America  tries  to  control  our  economy  through  the  IMF,  ""  comments  one  shopkeeper.  Pressure  from  the  IMF  lias  apparently  forced  the  government  to  raise  utility  rates  frequently,  with  devastating  results.  It  is  in  the  impoverished  rural  communities  that  the  effects  are  most  clearly  perceived,  with  many  unable  to  afford  food  and  basic  health  care.  As  the  state  system  crumbles  under  the  pressure  of  its  debts,  the  vacuum  created  has  been  filled   with  others.  The  poor  are  turning  to  the  religious  schools,  or  madrassas,  often  breeding  grounds  for  a  more  intolerant  version  of  Islam.  The  program  maintains  that  though  the  attacks  on  September  11  were  universally  condemned  throughout  the  Muslim  world,   America's  reprisals  against  Afghanistan  have  changed  everything.  But,  as  Imran  Kahn  asks  in  this  compelling  report  from  the  UK  -  is  only  America  to  blame,  or  have  the  values  of  Pakistan's  ruling  class  also  played  a  part  in  fomenting  resentment  against  the  West?

"  Delete  it   DURING  several  interviews,  Abu  Bakar  Bashir  has  repeatedly  used  the  word  “infidel”.  This  expression  of  intolerant  fanati  cism  is  the  root  of  the  awful  phe  nomenon  that  created  terrorism.   We  should  demand  that  this  word  be  removed  not  only  from  Muslim  liturgy,  but  Arab  vocabu  lary.   Its  origin  and  use  is  no  longer  acceptable  and  is  the  very  antithesis  of  modern  societies  struggling  to  implement  peace  ful  coexistence  in  this  global  vil  lage.   Should  Australian  Muslims   accept  the  term  “infidel”,  they  would,  ipso  facto,  regard  all  19   million  of  us  as  enemies.  How  would  this  contribute  to  harmo  ny  in  a  multi-ethnic  society?   If  the  Holy  See  saw  it  timely,  indeed  overdue,  to  remove  the  word  “deicide”  from  its  liturgy,  Islam  should  also  move  with  the  times  and  instruct  its  clergy  to  desist  using  this  obnoxious   word.

"  WHILE  it  is  not  racist  to  oppose  illegal  immigration,  it  is,  however,  very  dis  criminatory  to  refuse  to  allow  an  entire  group  of  people  into  the  coun  try  based  on  the  fear  that  they  may  have  an  incriminating  past.   There  are  more  than  a  billion  Muslims  in  the  world,  and  just  like  with  Christianity  and  Judaism,  the  overwhelming  majority  are  good  peace-loving  people.   If  the  public  is  wary  of  immigrants  from  Arab  and  Muslim  countries,  then  it  perhaps  should  be  reminded   that  almost  all  Australians  can  trace  their  origins  to  other  countries.   Islam  is  a  peaceful  religion  peace  fully  observed  by  a  billion  people.  There  are  extremists,  but  there  are  also  extremist  Christians  and  Jews.  Yet  we  do  not  persecute  Jews  and   Christians.   As  Jews,  we  know  how  dangerous  it  is  to  stereotype  an  entire  group  based  on  the  behaviour  of  a  few.

"  Deep  misgivings   MY  interview  with  the  AJN  (01/03/02)  has  attracted  some  negative  interest.   I  did  not  ask  to  be  interviewed.  The  interview  lasted  well  over  an  hour  and  touched  on  a  very  wide  range  of  top  ics,  most  of  which  were  ignored  in  the  report.   We  naturally  touched  on  the  cur  rent  refugee  issue.  I  made  clear  that  I  regard  the  present  Australian  intake  of  12,000  refugees  as  appropriate,  and  1  certainly  do  not  oppose  this  intake,  provided  that  they  are  genuine  refugees.   If  the  story  gave  a  different  impres  sion,  this  is  because  my  remarks  were  not  properly  reported.   I  did,  however,  make  clear  my  deep  misgivings  about  some  aspects  of  the  large-scale  admission  of  fundamental   ist  Muslims  to  Australia.   To  Jerry  Sperling,  Diana  Wolowski  et  al  (AJN  8/03/02),  I  can  only  ask:  what  planet  have  you  been  living  on?  After  the  horrors  of  the  past  seven  months,  in  America  and  on  a  virtual  daily  basis  in  Israel,  it  begs  belief  that  I  should  be  criticised  for  drawing  attention  to  the  threat  to  Jewish  life  which  potentially  exists  from  this  quarter.   The  situation  is  Australia  today  is  vastly  different  from  that  of  half-a-cen  tury  ago,  when  there  was  no  unem  ployment  and  industry  was  crying  out  for  unskilled  labour.   Today,  unskilled  immigrant  labour  is  almost  unemployable,  and  those  migrants  without  skills  will  not  find  jobs  for  many  years,  if  ever.  About  65  per  cent  (some  sources  claim  70  per  cent)  of  all  Afghans  are  illiterate.  Many  have  never  been  outside  of  a  village,  and  have  no  marketable  skills  of  any  kind.   What  is  their  future  likely  to  be  in  Australia,  and  what  is  their  attitude  towards  Jews  likely  to  be  after  years  of  unemployment?   However,  perhaps  Mr  Springer  et  al   can  introduce  a  factual  element  to  this  debate  by  providing  accurate  statis  tics  of  what  the  unemployment  rate  among  recent  Afghan  arrivals  here  actually  is.  Indeed,  I  challenge  them  to  provide  this  information.   I  strongly  emphasise  that  I  have   nothing  but  praise  for  refugees  to  this  country  who  make  good  and  accept  Australia’s  pluralistic  society.  My  fears  concern  those  who  don’t.   There  is  also  the  separate  but  potentially  even  more  serious  ques  tion  of  the  growth  of  Muslim  numbers  in  Australia,  especially  compared  with  the  number  of  Jews  here.  In  1971  there  were  fewer  than  1000  Muslims  in  Australia,  compared  with  about  70,000  Jews.  In  1996,  however,  there  were  201,000  Muslims  in  Australia,  compared  with  perhaps  105,000  Jews.   Over  the  next  few  decades,  the  size  of  the  Muslim  community  here  will  obviously  increase  rapidly,  while  the  size  of  the  Jewish  community  will  increase  slowly,  if  at  all.  Within  a  few  decades,  there  may  well  be  half-a-mil  Iion  Muslims  in  Australia—a  vast  vot   ing  lobby  which  any  and  every  gov   pmmmt  must  and  will  acknowledge.

"  Letters   I  WRITE  in  repsonse  to  Jonathan  Ariel’s  letter,  in  which  he  criticis  es  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  for  condemning  Rev  erend  Frank  Nile’s  proposition  that  Australian  Muslim  women  should  be  barred  from  wearing  the  traditional  chador  (AJN  6/12/02).   This  notion  is  repulsive  in  its  undemocratic  and  discrimatory  nature,  comparable  to  an  edict  outlawing  the  sheitel  —  the  Jew  ish  equivalent.   It  is  worthy  to  note  that  both  the  chador  and  the  sheitel  ensure  modesty  —  a  universal  theme  of  both  religious  tradi   tions.   What  we  must  really  fear  as  a  community  is  not  material  or  outward  difference,  as  Adolf  Hitler  did  60  years  ago,  but  extremist  values  that  lurk  within  Muslims,  Christians  and  Jews  alike.   Times  of  crises  require  vigi  lance  yet  moderacy,  security  yet  sensibility.   Religious  extremism  is  the  true  peril  here,  not  some  piece  of  cloth  that  merely  unnerves  those  ignorant  amongst  us.   Judd  Weinberg   Dover  Heights,  NSW ",2002-12-13
"  Too  much  space   AGAIN,  Avigail  Abarbinel  has  been  given  far  too  much  space  (AJN  29/11/02).   I  accept  that  only  a  tiny  minority  of  Muslims  are  fanatics  prepared  to  blow  themselves  up  and  shoot  chil   dren  in  their  beds.   Why  then  do  we  not  hear  more  cries  of  condemnation  from  the  Aus  tralian  and  international  Islamic  communities?  Surely  it  is  not  too  much  to  expect  more  Muslim  lead  ers  around  the  world  to  go  public.   One  would  also  expect  moderates  to  dob  in  the  destructive  elements.   When  more  Muslims  condemn  the  actions  of  some  of  their  co-reli  gionists,  I  will  consider  supporting  a  call  such  as  that  proposed  by  Abar   binel.   In  the  meantime,  I  suggest  that  such  views  as  she  espouses  have  no  place  in  a  Jewish  newspaper.

"  Russian  theatre  seige  leaves  surviving  critics  divided   MOSCOW,  Monday:  Foreign  critics  who  survived  a  siege  by  Chechen  rebels  in  Moscow's  Palace  of  Culture  theatre  have  delivered  mixed  reviews  of  the  terrorists'  performance.  'It  was  with  some  weariness  that  I  attended  another  production  of   Nord-Ost,'  wrote  Fforbes  Hyphen-Smythe  for  The  Guardian.  'Its  popularity  among  Muscovites  led  me  to  expect  a.  run  of-the-mill,  mainstream,  crowd  pleaser.  And  for  much  of  the  first  act,  it  was.  The  musical  version,  of  an  old  Russian  story  about  two  students  trying  to  follow  their  hearts  under  the  Soviet  regime  was  pleasant  enough,  but  nothing  out  of  the  ordinary.  So  I  was  almost  grateful  when  it  took  a  surprising  lurch  into  avant-garde  political,  commentary,  as  forty-odd  Chechen  rebels  interrupted  the  musical  to  inform  us  that  we  were  being  held  hostage  until  such  time  as  Russia  pulls  its  army  out  of  Chechnya.  The  change  In  the  evening's  character  was  difficult  to  swallow,  and,  I  feel,  could  have  been  pulled  off  a  little  more  smoothly  with  a.  Chechen  dance  interlude,  or  lighting  effects.  But  who  was  I  to  argue,  now  that  1  suddenly  found  myself  with  a  would-be  martyr  primed  to  go  off  in  the  seat  beside  me?'  Julius  Mrova,  of  Die  Welt,  was  less  positive.  'There  is  avant  garde,'  wrote  Mrova,  'and  then  there  is  just  plain,  self-indulgent.  Once  the  narrative  took  a  turn,  the  play  spiralled,  into  an  increasingly  intolerable  orgy  of  confusion,  violence  and  human  rights  deprivation,  made  up  for  somewhat  by  the  Chechen's  breathtaking  ability  to  break,  down  the  fourth  wall.  Indeed,  we  were  encouraged  to  call  our  loved  ones  and  media  outlets  outside  the  theatre,  in  an  audacious  and  largely  successful  attempt  to  take  the  performance  beyond  the  confines  of  the  theatre  itself.  'I  was  somewhat  disappointed  with  the  choice  of  the  term  'terrorists'  to  characterise  the  bad  guys.  So  very  easy  to  do  in  the  current  world  atmosphere,  it  was  the  easy  way  out  in  a  creative  choice  with  all  the  inventiveness  of  Hollywood.  And  blow  me  down  if   Critics  have  been  divided  about  the  success  of  Nord  Ost   they  weren't  Muslim.  Can  we  not  move  on  from  this  cliche?  Were  it  not  for  the  saving  fact  that  the  'Muslim  Chechen  terrorist'  roles  were  all  being  played  by  actual  Muslim  Chechen  terrorists,  I  would  have  walked  out,  had  they  let  me  do  so.'  The  consensus  was  that  the  Chechens  made  a  number  of  daring  creative  choices  that  didn't  quite  come  off.  The  decision  to  divide  the  audience  into  groups  and  separate  them  was  generally  agreed  to  be  a  clumsy  attempt  to  recreate  the  division  between  peoples  that  lies  at  the  heart  of  the  conflict.  Allowing  Muslims,  children  and  pregnant  women  to  leave  was  an  evocative  comment  on  the  exclusion  of  such  groups  from  the  mainstream  paradigm,  but  shooting  those  who  attempted  to  leave  of  their  own  accord  was  a  harsh  way  of  criticising  society's  suspicion  of  those  who  choose  to  go  their  own  way,  many  said.  'Perhaps  blanks  would  have  been  more  appropriate,'  said  Hyphen  Smythe.  The  length  of  the  production  was  another  sticking  point.  'What  really  could  have  been  played  out  in  an  hour  stretched  on  interminably,'  wrote  Jean,  Flave  in  Le  Monde.  'The  terrorists  claimed  to  be  negotiating  with  parties  outside  the  building.  Why  they  had  to  be  outside  is  beyond  me  -  why  not  to  the  side  of  the  stage,  accompanied  by  lighting  effects  and  a  set  change?  Or  If  modern  terrorism  was  their  motif,  then  perhaps  some  sort  of  'satellite-   cross'  presentation  could  have  been  appropriate.  As  it  was,  leaving  us  out  of  an  entire  half  of  the  dialogue  left  me,  for  one,  frustrated.  'What  is  more,  the  interval  could  have  been  more  evenly  placed.  The  first  act  went  for  an  hour  and  a  half;  the  second,  two  and  a  half  days.  Consequently,  the  orchestra  was  superb  in  the  first  act,  but  tired  during  the  second.  It  reached  the  point  where  many  audients  were  literally  shitting  into  the  pit  -  a  cruel  heckle,  but  fair.  My  impression  was  that  few  of  those  who  saw  it  will  be  back  to  see  it  again.'  The  eventual  denouement,  however,  was  quite  well  received.  'Having  assumed  throughout  that  we  were  either  going  to  be  rescued  or  slaughtered  by  our  captors  in  a  good  old-fashioned  shootout,  we  were  all  caught  by  surprise  when  a  foul  odour  signalled  the  entrance  of  Russian  troops  into  the  building,'  said  Mrova.  'We  applauded,  largely  in  relief  at  the  end  of  the  play,  but  caught  our  breaths  when,  in  a  surprise  twist,  we  started  dying  at  the  hands  of  the  poisonous  gas  they  released.  And  thus  we  were  left  with  the  final  (for  some,  VERY  final)  realisation  that  Russia,  in  its  obsessive  battle  against  the  Chechens,  has  once  again  shot  itself  in  the  foot.  As  I  drifted  rapidly  into  a  coma,  it  struck  ir-  that  only  in  Russia  could  such  .1  nihilist  ending  be  deemed  acceptable  to  a  mainstream  audience.' ",2002-11-08
"  Friends  at  the  UIA   ISRAELIS  are  being  killed  for  one  reason  —  hate,  says  Israel  Consul-General  Ephraim  Ben  Matityahu.   Addressing  the  annual  general  meeting  of  the  NSW  branch  of  the  UIA,  Mr  Ben-Matityahu  said  the  hate  did  not  originate  in  grievances  or  occupation,  but  in  the  aspirations  of  those  who  want  to  destroy  Israel.   “It  started  long  ago,  at  the  very  beginning  of  the  Zionist  movement,  through  the  1948  war  —  the  inability  to  accept  a  non-Arab,  non  Muslim  state  in  the  Middle  East,”  he  said.  “It’s  a  war  between  an  inclusive,  modern  society  and  a  uniform  society  seeking  exclusive  rights   for  itself.”   But  drawing  on  Jewish  tradition  that  teach  es  that  all  Israel  is  responsible  for  one  another,  Mr  Ben-Matityahu  added:  “Being  your  guest  and  being  Consul-General,  I  can  testify  that  we  have  a  great  friendship  with  this  organisation  (the  UIA)  and  the  Jewish  community  of   Australia.”   Israeli  Consul-General  Ephraim  Ben-SVlatftyahu   addresses  the  UIA  NSW  annual  general  meeting.

"  Government  condemns   Arab  boycott  of  companies   Bernard  Freedman   A  FEDERAL  Government  minister  has  con  demned  an  Arab-sponsored  international  campaign  to  boycott  companies  with  pro  Israel  links,  describing  it  as  “illogical,  coun  terproductive  and  un-Australian’.   Citizenship  and  Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  Gary  Hardgrave’s  criticism  is  in  line  with  government  policy  expressed  by  Foreign  Minister  Alexander  Downer.   Hardgrave  attacked  the  Australian  Arabic  Community  Council  (AACCT)  for  supporting  a  leaflet  campaign  in  Lakemba,  urging  Muslims  to  boycott  35  firms,  including  McDonald’s,  David  Jones,  Red  Rooster  and  Coles,  alleging  they  were  US-owned  and  pro-Israeli.   “I  would  have  thought  the  leadership  of  the  Australian  Arabic  Community  Council  would  be  more  responsible  than  to  be  asso  ciating  itself  with  this  nonsense,  which  has  come  from  nations  outside  Australia  less  cohesive  than  our  own,”  he  said.   “We  need  Australians  to  turn  to  each  other,  not  turn  on  each  other.   Creating  division  by  calling  on  sections  of  our  community  to  turn  against  other  sec  tions  of  our  community  is  un-Australian.   “I  call  on  members  of  the  Australian  Arabic  Council  to  act  quickly  and  pull  their  leadership  into  line.”   Meanwhile,  the  Palestinian  Human  Rights  Campaign  is  calling  on  its  website  for  a  boy  cott  of  the  National  Australia  Bank,  claiming  it  is  a  partner  in  the  “illegal  activities”  of  the  United  Israel  Appeal  in  the  displacement  of  Palestinians  and  in  “rabid  propaganda  about  the  Palestinian  people”.   The  website  quotes  a  speech  by  former  UIA  president  Mark  Leibler  congratulating  NAB  CEO  Frank  Cicutto  for  supporting  the  UIA  and  Israel,  and  urges  customers  to  close  their  accounts  in  protest.   Responding  to  Hardgrave’s  attack,  AACC  chair  Hassan  Moussa  said  the  council  did  not  support  the  messages  expressed  in  a  leaflet  featuring  a  dead  Palestinian  baby  allegedly  shot  by  an  Israeli  soldier.   But  he  added:  “We  do  support  people’s  democratic  right  to  protest  and  express  their  views  about  injustices.  Boycotts  are  one  way  of  expressing  these  views.   “Boycotts  of  companies  perceived  to  support  the  policies  of  Israel’s  military   Gary  Hardgrave   against  Palestinian  civilians  are  not  unlike  the  boycotts  of  South  Africa  over  apartheid.   “The  best  way  to  resolve  the  conflict  is  through  negotiation.”   Lebanese  Muslim  Association   spokesman  Keysar  Trad  denied  that  Muslim  bodies  in  Australia  had  produced  the  leaflets,  adding  that  his  association  would  not  advocate  a  boycott  unless  it  was  certain  the  companies  were  directly  involved  in  killing  innocent  people.   Islamic  Council  of  Australia  president  Yasser  Soloman  told  Radio  3AW  he  was  a  shareholder  in  Coles  and  was  worried  about  the  boycott  threat.   International  companies  being  targeted  include  Caterpillar,  whose  earthmoving  equipment  was  being  used  to  demolish  Palestinian  homes.  “They’ve  been  asked  to  state  their  position,”  Soloman  said.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry   president  Jeremy  Jones  condemned  the  call  for  a  boycott  as  “nothing  to  do  with  princi  ple  and  everything  to  do  with  bigotry”.   If  those  calling  for  a  boycott  were  seri  ous,  they  should  boycott  medical  practi  tioners  prescribing  life-saving  drugs  produced  by  US-owned  companies  and  also  the  companies  producing  the  drugs,  he  said.

"  500  protest,   others  stay  away   MEMBERS  of  the  Orthodox  and  Reform  rabbinate  united  in  support  of  refugees  at  a  Jewish  vigil  at  Maribyrnong  Deten  tion  Centre  in  Melbourne  last  week.   About  500  people,  many  bearing  matzah  and  a  shofar,  demonstrated  out  side  the  barbed-wire  fence.  But  many  Jews  boycotted  the  rally,  insisting  that  Jewish  support  of  Muslim  refugees  was  inappropriate  while  Israel  is  bleeding.   The  vigil  was  organised  by  Jews  for  Refugees.  Temple  Beth  Israel  Rabbi  Fred  Morgan  said  that  “by  treating  refugees  with  anything  less  than  dignity,  we  red  uce  their  status  as  human  beings,  and  we  reduce  our  status  as  human  beings.”   His  sentiments  were  echoed  by  Rab  binical  Council  of  Victoria  president  Rabbi  Chaim  Gutnick,  who  sent  a  state  ment  of  support.   In  a  symbolic  offering  to  the  90  asy  lum-seekers  inside,  the  demonstrators  laid  matzah  outside  the  razor-wire  fence  and  sang  songs  from  the  Haggadah.

I  am  proud  that  well-educated  and  highly  respected  members  of  the  community  such  as  Professor  Rubinstein  have  taken  it  upon  them  selves  to  solve  the  refugee  issue:  in  giving  literacy  to  the  65  per  cent  of  Afghans  coming  to  our  country  for  protection  who  cannot  read  or  write;  in  taking  those  who  would  otherwise  “fester  in  the  underworld  of  crime,  drugs  and  prostitution”  into  his  own  home;  in  making  up  for  the  inade  quate  provisions  offered  by  our   Federal  Government  to  those  processed  as  genuine  refugees  (who  may  still  be  suffering  from  the  psy  chological  and  physical  effects  of  their  extended  stay  in  detention  camps);  and  in  improving  the  opin  ions  of  asylum-seekers  about  the  ethics  and  values  of  Jewish  people.   What?  He  doesn’t  want  Muslim  asylum-seekers,  even  the  genuine  ones  fleeing  from  persecution,  to  be  let  into  our  fine  and  democratic  country?  What  a  copout.

"  Dozens  of  Jewish  graves  desecrated  in  Rome   Ruth  E  Gruber   ROME  —  Italian  police  and  Jewish  leaders  are  disagreeing  over  the  motives  behind  the  desecration  of  dozens  of  Jewish  graves  in  a  Rome  cemetery.   Police  over  the  weekend  appeared  to  be  focusing  their  investigation  on  local  cemetery  maintenance  rackets  rather  than  on  neo-Nazi  antisemites  or  Muslim  fanatics.   “I  don’t  think  I  agree  with  this,  but  they  seem  to  be  pursuing  that  line,”  said  Riccardo  Pacifici,  a  spokesman  for  Rome’s  Jewish  community.   He  urged  “prudence”,  however,  adding  that  if  rackets  were  involved,  it  was  hard  to  understand  why  only  Jewish  tombs  were  targeted.   Police  over  the  weekend  interrogated  cemetery  workers  and   seized  tools  and  maintenance  equipment.   Vandals  smashed  as  many  as  three  dozen  tombs  in  the  Jewish  section  of  Rome’s  Verano  cemetery  on  the  night  of  July  17,  the  beginning  of  Tisha  b’Av,  the  solemn  fast  day  that  marks  the  anniversary  of  the  destruction  of  the  First  and  Second  Temples.   “It  doesn’t  seem  to  me  as  if  this  attack  came  on  a  date  chosen  by  chance,”  said  Amos  Luzzatto,   president  of  the  Union  of  Italian  Jewish  Communities.  “The  coincidence  is  too  suggestive  to  be  ignored.”   Police  believe  at  least  10  people  took  part  in  the  raid.  They  shattered  marble  tablets,  destroyed  vases  and  statues,  wrenched  off  Stars  of  David  and  even  dug  down  into  graves.   But  unlike  previous  episodes  of  antisemitic  vandalism  in  Rome,  including  the  desecration  of  Jewish  graves  at  another  Rome  cemetery  in  1996,  the  perpetrators  did  not  scrawl  swastikas  or  antisemitic  slogans.   The  attack  stunned  local  Jews   and  prompted  an  outpouring  of  sympathy  and  indignation  from  President  Carlo  Azeglio  Ciampi,  Prime  Minister  Silvio  Berlusconi  and  other  officials.  Local  Muslim  groups  also  condemned  the  attack.   “This  is  extremely  serious,”  Rome  Mayor  Walter  Veltroni  said  July  18  after  visiting  the  scene.  “This  was  clearly  done  with  the  intention  of  damaging  a  place  that  is  particularly  dear  to  the  Jewish  community  of  Rome.”   Jewish  groups  and  other  observers  alike  viewed  the  desecra  tion  as  the  latest  in  the  wave  of  attacks  on  Jewish  institutions  and  individuals  in  several  countries  in  recent  months,  linked  to  the  conflict  in  the  Middle  East.  Most  of  those   Kalian  policemen  Inspect  the  Jewish  section  of  Rome's  Verano  cemetery  where  dozens  of  tombs  were  desecrated  last  week.  The  anttterrorism  branch  of  the  Kalian  police  are  Investigating  the  Incident.  Photo:  ap/aap   attacks  appear  to  have  been  carried  out  by  young  Arabs  hitting  out  at  Jews  as  surrogates  for  Israel.   To  date,  no  such  attacks  had  taken  place  in  Italy.  But  the  cemetery  raid  came  less  than  a  week  after  police  virtually  sealed  off  the  historic  Jewish  Ghetto  in  Venice  because  of  an  apparent  terrorist   threat.   In  a  message  last  Friday  to  Rome   Chief  Rabbi  Riccardo  Di  Segni,  Pope  John  Paul  n  said  he  was  “profoundly  saddened  by  this  detestable  act  that  follows  other  similar  events  of  a  serious  nature  that  have  taken  place  with  alarming  frequency  in  Europe  and  on  other  continents”.   He  also  condemned  such  “ignoble  acts  and  the  anti-Jewish  sentiments  that  inspire  them”.   The  national  director  of  the   Anti-Defamation  League,  Abraham  Foxman,  was  in  Rome  when  the  attack  took  place.  He  was  in  Italy  for  a  meeting  with  Berlusconi  as  part  of  consultations  with  European  leaders  on  how  to  combat  the  new  wave  of  antisemitism.  He,  too,  inspected  the  cemetery.  “The  Jews  of  the  world  feel  more  vulnerable  than  they  did  50,60  years  ago,”  he  said.   JTA   «  « ",2002-07-26
"  David  Klrszbaum...  “Many  of  my  Mends  and  colleagues  are  Muslim.”   Teen  pilot  flying  high   Staff  Exporter   HIS  teenage  friends  may  be  stressing  as  they  decide  on  a  career  path,  but  David  Kirszbaum  is  happy  in  the  knowledge  that  his  future  is  up  in  the  air.  Literally.   At  just  19,  David  recently  became  one  of  Australia’s  youngest  flight  instructors,  and  is   set  for  a  career  in  aviation.   He  is  flying  high,  and  is  about  to  start  teach  ing  that  same  skill  to  prospective  pilots  at  one  of  the  country’s  leading  flight  schools.   A  Bialik  College  graduate,  David  first  decid  ed  to  head  skywards  as  he  contemplated  the  end  of  his  schooling.   “I  started  to  think  seriously  about  flying  at  the  start  of  my  VCE  [Melbourne’s  HSC-equiva  lent],”  he  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.   “I  went  for  my  first  lesson  in  the  first  week  of  Year  12  and  was  hooked  straight  away.  You  only  need  one  flight;  after  that,  you  just  want  to  stay  up  in  the  air.”   While  his  classmates  buried  their  heads  in  schoolbooks,  David  pored  over  flight  paths  and  aviation  maps.  He  was  flying  solo  before  mid-year  exams.   “I  loved  it  so  much,  it  became  a  distraction.  I  had  to  force  myself  to  sit  at  my  desk  when  all  I  wanted  to  do  was  sit  in  a  cockpit.”   The  balancing  act  between  spending  time  at  the  airport  and  school  work  paid  off,  and  David’s  VCE  score  of  99.05  placed  him  in  the  top  one  per  cent  of  the  state.   He  spent  much  of  last  year  honing  his  flying  skills  while  working  as  a  waiter  at  weddings   and  bar  mitzvahs  to  earn  money.   “It  doesn’t  matter  whether  you’ve  flown  for  one  hour  or  100,  the  feeling  is  the  same  every  time  —  pure  excitement.   “There’s  a  lot  of  studying  involved,  a  lot  of  DreDaration.  but  it’s  a  real  challenge  and  it  s   very  rewarding  once  you  get  up  in  the  air.  Get  ting  my  commercial  licence  was  an  absolute   thrill.”   Again  juggling  his  time  between  study  and  the  sty,  David  has  begun  a  four-year  course  in  aerospace  engineering.   The  intemationally-renowned  course  offers  students  the  chance  to  work  with  leading  avia  tion  companies  like  Boeing  as  part  of  their   studies.   Religion  has  played  an  unusual  part  in  his  chosen  career,  he  noted.   “Many  of  my  friends  and  colleagues  at  Moorabbin  Airport  are  Muslim.  I’ve  had  many  arguments  —  friendly  ones  —  about  Israel,  land  for  peace  and  the  Middle  East.   “Some  of  them  have  even  asked  for  my  Jew  ish  Studies  textbooks  so  they  can  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  Jewish  perspective.   “There  aren’t  too  many  Jewish  pilots  around;  it’s  not  a  very  common  path   to  follow.”   “There  aren’t  too  many  Jewish  pilots  around;  it’s  not  a  very  common  path  to  follow.  A  lot  of  people  advised  against  becoming  a  pilot.  They  said  it  was  an  unstable  industry  and  there  was  no  chance  of  getting  a  job.   “I  would  have  regretted  it  had  I  not  given  it   a  shot.”   David’s  passion  for  flying  and  his  desire  to  share  his  knowledge  led  to  the  decision  to  become  a  flight  instructor,  and  he  has  been  busy  organising  business  cards,  leaflets  and  other  forms  of  advertising.   His  ultimate  ambition?  To  become  the  cap  tain  of  a  commercial  airliner  with  Qantas. ",2002-08-16
"  Cautious  response  to  taskforce  to  tackle  racist  violence   Bernard  Freedman   JEWISH  leaders  have  given  a  mixed  response  to  a  decision  by  Federal  and  State  government  ministers  to  set  up  a  taskforce  to  tackle  racist  violence  and  vilification  in  Aus  tralia  arising  from  international   tension.   A  meeting  of  Federal  and  State  immigration  and  multicultural  affairs  ministers  in  Darwin  agreed  to  adopt  a  national  approach  to  “external  threats  to  community  harmony”.   They  were  responding  to  a  call  by  Federal  Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  Gary  Hardgrave  for  an  improved  national  response  to  attacks  on  synagogues  arising  from  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict,  and  threats  and  attacks  against  Muslim  individuals  and  institutions  after  September  11.   ACT  Jewish  Community  presi  dent  Gary  Fellman,  speaking  after  another  firebomb  attack  on  Can  berra’s  National  Jewish  Centre,  said  he  was  pleased  to  see  the  Fed  eral  Government  taking  the  type  of  action  the  Jewish  community  had  been  urging.   “Mr  Hardgrave  is  doing  the  right  thing,  and  1  hope  something  comes   out  of  it.”   But  Executive  Council  of  Aus  tralian  Jewry  deputy  president   Diane  Shteinman  was  more   reserved,  saying  the  Jewish  com  munity  had  never  indulged  in  eth   nic  violence.   “There  has  been  an  upsurge  in  antisemitic  violence  and  threats,  but  nobody  has  ever  been  appre  hended,  so  we  don’t  know  whether  it  is  ethnic  violence  or  the  work  of  other  Australians,”  she  said.   “If  a  taskforce  would  assist  in  apprehending  people  who  have  done  these  things,  that  would  be  fine,  but  the  police  have  never  found  anyone.”   Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  executive  direct  Dr  Colin  Rubenstein  welcomed  the  govern  ment  decision,  which  he  said  indi  cated  some  focus  and  effort  to  deal  with  the  recent  wave  of  vandalism   Federal  Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  Gary  Hardgrave  with  Executive  Council  of   Australian  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  and  Jewish  Care  president  Eva  Flschl  at  a  meeting  with  Jewish  communal  leaders  last  week.  The  leaders  urged  the  Federal  Government  to  crack  down  on  those  responsible  for  the  upsurge  In  antisemitlc  incidents  In  Australia  In  recent  months.   against  Jewish  institutions  and  vio  lence  against  other  communities.   The  meeting  in  Darwin  decided  that  Federal  and  State  immigration  and  multicultural  affairs  officials  should  be  responsible  for  identify  ing  “risk  or  threat  to  community  harmony”  and  developing  a  strate   gy   The  agenda  for  the  meeting  pro  posed  that  this  would  be  done  in  consultation  with  the  Federal  Immigration  and  Multicultural  Affairs  Department  and  “other  stakeholders”  —  police,  intelli  gence  agencies  and  community  organisations.   These  groups  would  monitor  domestic  and  international  devel   opments  to  try  to  anticipate  flash  points  in  Australia,  meet  in  emergency  sessions  when  neces  sary  to  deal  with  “emerging  threats  to  community  harmony”,  and  sug  gest  strategies  on  which  ministers  might  act.   The  meeting  agreed  that  this   consultative  framework  could  be   applied  to  the  Middle  East  situa   tion.   “We  can  make  sure  that  the  frus  trations  of  our  multicultural  com  munity  don’t  become  major  flashpoints  when  external  chal  lenges  like  what’s  happening  in  the  Middle  East  occur,”  Mr  Hardgrave   said.   “In  a  democratic  society,  it  is  understandable  that  people,  espe  cially  those  of  Jewish,  Palestinian  and  Muslim  background,  voice  anguish  at  the  bloodshed  in  Israel  and  the  area  administered  by  the  Palestinian  Authority,”  he  said.   He  called  on  “moderate  leaders  from  both  sides  to  discuss  the  situ  ation,  rather  than  revert  to  extrem  ist  behaviour”.   Shadow  Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  Laurie  Ferguson  accused  him  of  “grandstanding”  by  claiming  that  the  ministers  had  agreed  to  establish  a  national  taskforce.   This  was  “incorrect”,  he  said.  The  meeting  had  simply  decided   that  the  States  and  the  Common  wealth  should  exchange  informa  tion  on  their  initiatives  to  deal  with  threats  to  community  harmony  resulting  from  international  events.

"  Not  anti-Israel   I  READ  your  pieces  with  interest  pertaining  to  John  Pilger’s  docu  mentary  Palestine  Is  Still  the  Issue  (AW  4/10/02).   It  is  my  view  that  the  program  was  anti-violence,  not  anti-Israel  or  pro-Palestine.   It  is  my  belief  that  peace  is  possi  ble,  but  for  that  to  happen  we  must  together  elevate  our  thinking.  It  was  refreshing  to  see  Jews  in  that  docu  mentary  prepared  to  do  that.   If  we  keep  our  thinking  at  the  same  level  that  has  created  the  vio  lence,  how  can  we  find  a  solution?  If  people  on  both  sides  continue  to  bury  their  heads  in  the  sand,  placing  total  blame  on  the  other,  we  will  never  get  anywhere  and  the  cycle  of   violence  will  continue.   I,  as  an  Australian  Muslim,  am  prepared  to  work  with  anyone  from  any  background  toward  helping  the  process  toward  peace.  The  question  is  whether  you  share  this  position.

""Whatever  happened  to  the  great  Aussie  tradition  of  getting  a  girl  drunk  at  a  party,  forcing  her  to  have  sex,  giving  your  mates  a  go,  then  fracturing  her  skull  with  a  rock?""  said  Barry  Collins,  who  is  one  of  the  proponents  of  the  plan  launched  yesterday.  The  call  comes  after  a  spate  of  gang  rapes  by  Muslim  youths  in  western  Sydney.  ""We  need  to  tell  immigrants  that  if  they  are  going  to  come  to  our  country  and  rape  our  women,  they'd  better  learn  to  do  it  in  a  traditional  Australian  way  rather  than  bringing  their  foreign  culture  with  them,""  said  Collins.

"  Feature  J   The  world  did  not  change  after  September  11,  argues  Shlomo  Ben-Ami.  It’s  just  the  US  which  is  exploiting  that  perception  for  its  own  purposes.   HEEDING  the  language  used   by  politicians,  specifically  by  US  President  George  W  Bush,  one  concludes  that  the  post-September  11  world  in  no  way  resembles  that  which  preceded  the  attack  on  the  World  Trade  Centre.   In  their  opinion,  we  are  in  the  throes  of  a  world  war  that  has  shaken  up  the  old  order.   This  is  gross  exaggeration.  The  world  before  and  after  September  11  is  the  same:  recession,  particularly  in  hi-tech,  which  slid  to  the  low  point  of  the  business  cycle  before  September  11;  poverty  and  hunger;  economic  and  political  crisis  in  South  America;  environmental  deterioration;  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict;  India  and  Pakistan  honing  their  nuclear  swords;  Russia’s  criminal  transformation  from  a  dictatorship  to  anarchic  capi  talism;  the  struggle  between  conser  vatives  and  reformers  in  nuclearising  Iran;  Iraq’s  evasion  of  supervision  of  its  mass-destruction  weapons;  increasing  fundamentalism  among  millions  of  Muslims  in  answer  to  dic  tatorship  and  corruption  in  places  still  known  for  some  reason  as  “mod  erate”  —  Egypt,  Saudi  Arabia,  the  Palestinian  Authority,  Algeria  —  not   to  mention  the  radical  Muslim  nations.   And  Europe  still  busy  with  its  own  affairs:  stabilising  the  euro,  expand  ing  the  EU,  and  its  failed  struggle  for  a  common  foreign  policy.   Al-Qaeda  is  a  small,  evil  terrorist  organisation,  a  far  cry  from  the  global  terror  superpower  the  US  would  have  us  believe.  This  balloon  has  been  blown  out  of  all  proportion  by  a  US  president  in  search  of  an  agenda:  politically  motivated,  power  motivat   ed.   The  US  administration,  assuming  office  bruised  and  nearly  delegit  imised  after  the  most  bizarre  election  in  American  history,  and  staggering  along  for  the  first  nine  months  in  office,  until  September  11,  without  direction,  clutched  at  al-Qaeda  as  an  unexpected  agenda.   If  al-Qaeda  is  really  a  tentacled  ter  ror  superpower,  how  could  all  of  American  intelligence  have  failed  to  take  note  of  it?  And  if  its  members  are  so  vicious,  why  haven’t  they  perpetrated  any  attack  since  September  11?   Osama  bin  Laden  saved  the  US  from  flailing  around  in  irrelevance,  and  injected  vision  into  an  adminis  tration  that  didn’t  know  what  to  do  with  the  world  placed  on  the  shoul  ders  of  the  new  president.   Now  the  vision  was  simple:  a  return  to  the  Reagan  era  and  the  opposition  of  western  democracies  versus  the  evil  Soviet  empire.  All  Bush  had  to  do  was  cast  al-Qaeda  as  the  Soviets.   The  problem  is  that  the  two  are  radically  different:  al-Qaeda  is  not  a  rotten  superpower  on  the  verge  of  collapse.  It  is  a  small,  amorphous  body,  and  the  problem  it  reflects  stems  from  the  frustration  Islam  experiences  vis-a-vis  western  civilisa  tion.  There’s  nothing  to  strike  at,  nothing  to  overthrow.   The  solution  does  not  lie  in  vying   for  supremacy  over  the  rival  bloc,  or  in  the  arms  race  that  broke  the  USSR’s  neck.   We  are  dealing  with  Islamic  civilisation  which  has  failed  in  finding  its  way  to  socioeconomic  modernity  or  democracy;  a  civilisation  that  has  not  been  able  to  develop  a  civic  soci  ety  and  freedom  of  speech,  and  which  is  rebelling  now  against  global  isation  perceived  as  the  reflection  of   American  hegemony.   No  force  will  solve  the  problems  of  Muslim  societies.  This  was  as  true   before  September  11  as  it  is  now:  the  solution  is  long  term,  rooted  in  changes  of  regime,  economic  devel  opment,  emergence  of  a  middle  class  and  adaptation  to  a  culture  founded  on  trust,  transparency  and  a  civic  society.   The  emphasis  on  the  need  for  democracy  in  the  Arab  world  is  the   correct  approach.  But  there  is  little  room  for  change;  moreover,  American  policy  is  woefully  inconsis   tent.   In  the  Arab  and  Muslim  world,  the  choice  is  not  between  democracy  and  dictatorship.  The  alternatives  are  secular  dictatorship  such  as  those  of  Hosni  Mubarak,  Abdelaziz  Bouteflika,  Mohammad  Shishi,  Muammar  Gaddafi,  Yasser  Arafat  and  Saddam  Hussein—or  Islamic  democ   racy,  a  fundamentalist  regime.   Once  Arafat  is  deposed,  Hamas  will  rise  to  power,  and  the  fall  of  Mubarak’s  regime  will  bring  a  more  severe  dictatorship  or  outright   Islamic  rule.   One  of  the  most  serious  conse  quences  of  September  11  and  the  US  exaggeration  of  al-Qaeda  is  the  carte  blanche  the  US  gave  regimes  of  oppression  to  “fight  terror”,  simply  because  they  are  “on   our  side”.   A  dictator  the  likes  of  Pervez  Musharraf,  with  his  finger  on  Pakistan’s  nuclear  button,  who  has  buried  the  democratisation  of  his  country  again  by  deferring  elec  tions  and  extending  his  term  of  office  by  five  more  years,  harbours   Islamic  terrorists.   Vladimir  Putin  in  Russia  grows  increasingly  autocratic  in  the  war  on  Chechnya.   The  US  persists  in  its   appeasement  of  the  Saudi  regime.  Saudi  sheikhs  who  fund  Wahabi  Islam  and  the  Islamic  terror  organisations  are  not  required  to  introduce  democ  racy.  The  reason:  they  sell  oil  to  the  West,  and  buy  weapons.   What  has  changed,  compared  to  pre-September  11?  The  “moderate”  regimes  in  the  Arab  world  follow   same   route:  no  democracy,  corruption,  seeking  stability  by  channelling  frus  tration  and  anger  towards  the  US  and  Israel.   The  mystification  of  al-Qaeda  has  played  into  the  hands  of  these  regimes,  since  the  threat  of  fundamentalism  was  always  the  rationale  for  oppression  and  the  iron   fist  in  the  Arab  world.   September  11  was  not  the  watershed  that  would  signal  the  start  of  a  mediation  process  between  the  political  elites  of  the  Arab  world,  which  are  pro-West  for  the  most  part,  and  the  masses,  usually  anti-West.   has  not  happened.  For  this  to  happen,  the  US,  and  the  West  in  general,  must  correct  the  per  ception  in  the  Middle  East  according   to  which  the   West  is  a  partner  in  a  conspiracy  with  their  tyrannical  rulers.   September  11  intensified  the  Bush  administration’s  obsession  with  Iraq,  which  presents  a  vital  threat.  But  it  poses  no  greater  threat  than  the  nuclear  apocalypse  of  an  encounter  between  the  military  dictatorship  in  Pakistan  and  an  India  ruled  by  a  nationalistic-religious  party  whose  fingers  are  also  itching  the  nuclear   button.   The  US  doesn’t  appear  to  be  expending  the  same  energies  in  the  IndoPakistan  arena  as  in  confronting  Iraq.  It  is  to  be  hoped  the  Bush  admin  istration  will  not  be  persuaded  by  its  own  rhetoric  to  launch  an  offensive  against  Iraq;  there  would  be  no  justifi  cation  in  the  eyes  of  Arab  regimes  or  their  public.   In  1990,  the  case  was  clear:  Iraq  invaded  a  sovereign  state,  though  even  then,  the  coalition’s   attack  sparked  demonstrations  in  vv  the  Arab  world.   Today,  with  no  such  clari  ty,  the  US  is  in  no  position  to  form  a  coalition  with  the  nations  of  the  Middle  East,  who  would  never  support  a  pre-emptive  strike.   The  European  Union  is  dwindling  into  a  military  midget  and  almost  certainly  ■]  won’t  join  the  attack,  so  an   American  offensive  will  unleash  anti-American  and  anti  Israeli  feelings  throughout  the  Arab  world  on  an  apocalyptic  scale.   Bin  Laden  and  al-Qaeda  will   return,  and  fundamentalist   Islam  will  become   the  driv   ing   US  President  George  W  Bush   Photo:  AP/AAP   force  behind  every  humiliated  young   Muslim.   The  publicity  awarded  al-Qaeda  by  the  Bush  administration’s  rheto  ric,  along  with  the  internet  and  September  11,  turned  al-Qaeda  into  the  dream  of  innumerable  young  men  and  women  in  the  Muslim  world.  An  offensive  against  Iraq  will  give  this  process  momentum  which  will  hit  the   foundations  of  Arab  nations  too.   IHE  American  experience  in  Afghanistan  is  not  an  unquali  M.  fied  success.  The  Taliban  was  overthrown  —  but  its  successors  are   losing  legitimacy.  Hamid  Karzai  is  an  American  puppet  surrounded  by  for  eign  bodyguards.   In  Iraq,  the  situation  threatens  to  be  even  more  complex,  for,  unlike  in  Afghanistan,  there  is  no  Northern  Alliance;  the  Americans  will  be  forced  to  impose  direct  rule,  which  will  ulti  mately  fail.   The  blame  for  the  lack  in  Iraq  of  a  counterpart  of  the  Afghan  Northern  Alliance’s  sort  rests  squarely  with  the  US.  During  the  Gulf  War,  the  US  refrained  from  nurturing  a  democrat  ic  alternative  to  Saddam.  It  anticipat  ed  a  change  of  regime  by  military  coup  which  would  raise  a  friendly  tyrant  to  power,  and  it  denied  aid  that   could  have  saved  the  rebel  move  ment.   In  doing  so,  the  US  abandoned  its  allies,  leaving  behind  the  perception  of  a  tendency  to  rely  on  dictators  while  remaining  impervious  to  their  cruelty  and  to  whether  they  are  for  or  against  the  US.   Any  “son  of  a  bitch”  is  legitimate,  provided  he’s  “our  son  of  a  bitch”.   The  correct  response  to  Iraq  must  have  a  threefold  foundation:   ©  Preventive  military  measures  against  terror,  with  international  co  operation;   ©  Joint  international  mechanisms  for  increased  equality  in  the  global  economy,  and   ©  Development  of  international  mechanisms  for  conflict  resolution  where  the  parties  have  proved  that  they  cannot  reach  a  solution  on  their  own,  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  being  a  case  in  point.   The  US  has  yet  to  turn  September  11  into  a  lever  for  positive  global  change.  Republican  unilateralism  of  the  pre-September  11  era  remains  unchanged;  it  has  not  turned  into  multiculturalism.  The  US  even  ignored  NATO’s  call  for  collective  defence  when  it  went  to  war  with  Afghanistan.   American  unilateralism  prevents  the  US  from  developing  tools  for  a  better  world  order  based  on  interna  tional  co-operation.   It  was  the  US  which  led  the  rebellion  against  the  Kyoto  Protocol  for  the  prevention  of  pollution  caused  by  poisonous  gases;  it  is  the  US  which  is  discouraging  agreements  concern  ing  limitations  of  weapons  stockpil  ing.  The  US  was  the  only  signatory  of  the  Comprehensive  Test  Ban  Treaty  which  refused  to  take  part  in  a  con  vention  of  the  countries  that  signed  the  agreement.   In  fact,  the  unilateral  drive  of  the  Bush  administration  has  not  changed  in  any  essential  way  since  September   11.  Bush’s  chief  concern  continues  to   be  shrugging  off  any  limitations  on  America’s  short-term  freedom  of  action.   The  international  community  must  ensure  that  Saddam’s  regime  is  overthrown,  but  without  entering  a  military  adventure  with  possibly  destructive  consequences.  This  can  be  done  by  increasing  pressure;  restoring  supervision;  encouraging  the  opposition;  and  tantalising  the  Iraqi  people  with  the  advantages  of  a  post-Saddam  era.   International  order  means  Russia   must  co-operate  in  checking  Iran’s  nuclear  plans  and  its  involvement  in   international  terror.

It  has  been  disappointed  by  the  French  Government’s  weak  reac  tion  to  the  antisemitic  aggression  of  recent  weeks,  carried  out  mainly  by  Arab  youths  in  reaction  to  Israeli-Palestinian  violence.   Yet  it  never  thought  the  alterna  tive  could  be  Le  Pen  —  an  extrem   ist  right-winger  who  favours   stricter  controls  on  North  African  immigration  to  France,  but  also  has  a  history  of  antisemitic  statements.   Since  Le  Pen  won  a  place  in  Sun  day’s  election  against  incumbent  Jacques  Chirac,  500,000  citizens  have  taken  to  the  streets  to  say  “no”  to  the  Nazism,  fascism,  xeno  phobia  and  antisemitism  that  Le  Pen’s  National  Front  represents.

She  tries  to  distance  herself  from  temple  politics,  but  there  is  no  alternative  congregation  for  her  to  join.   This  novel  is  set  more  than  a   year  after  the  death  of  Ruby’s  husband.  The  community  maintains  its  expectations  about  Ruby’s  lifestyle  even  though  she  is  now  just  a  member.   Essie  Sue,  Ruby’s  nemesis,  takes  on  the  role  of  changing  the  image  of  the  temple.   Among  Essie  Sue’s  ideas  are  a  low  fat,  low  salt  matzah  ball  sale  and  a  baseball  tea.   Everything  proceeds  until  the  baseball  coach  is  found  dead  on  the  baseball  diamond  and  Ruby  becomes  involved  in  trying  to  solve  the  murder.   This  is  a  light  read  which  can  be  completed  in  a  single  sitting.  It  is  a  nice  way  to  while  away  a  few  hours,  but  lacks  the  twists  and  turns  of  more  popular  Jewish   detective  stories.   Outwitting  Hitler   Marian  Pretzel   Random  House,  2002,  343  pages,   $24.95   THIS  book  was  originally  published  in  1985  with  other  editions  in  the  1990s.  It  was  the  focus  of  a  recent  Showtime  special,  resulting  in  the  book’s  re-branding  and  was  read  daily  over  a  couple  of  weeks  on  Radio  National.  The  introduction  is  by  Simon  Wiesenthal.   Marian  Pretzel  was  a  19-year-old  art  student  in  Lvov  when  the  Germans  invaded  Poland  in  1941.  Nine  months  later,  the  Gestapo  took  his  parents  away  and  Marian   was  sent  to  the  Janowska  concentration  camp.   Marian  escaped  from  the  camp  in  miraculous  circumstances.  In  connecting  with  the  underground,  he  used  his  student  skills  to  become  a  talented  and  daring  forger  to  survive.   His  story,  which  describes  how  he  survived  the  realities  of  the  Nazi  occupation,  is  inspiring  and  full  of  danger  and  suspense.  Marian  tells  his  tale  with  optimism  and   humour.   Understandably,  the  earlier  edition  was  on  the  English  syllabus  for  NSW  Higher  School  Certificate   students.   Bslam  and  DhimmStude   Bat  Ye’or   Farleigh  Dickinson  UP,  2002,  528  pages,  $43.95   THE  first  version  of  this  book  was   published  in  1980;  this  is  the   second  edition.  The  author  is  an  acknowledged  thinker  on  the  plight  of  Jews  and  Christians  in  the   Muslim  world.   This  set  of  laws  (dhimmis)  forms  the  foundation  of  this  book  which  looks  at  Muslim  theology  as  it  applies  to  Jews  and  Christians.   Bat  Ye’or  coins  the  phrase  “dhimmitude”  to  describe  the  common  history  of  the  faiths  of  the  children  of  Abraham  as  well  as  their  legal  status  under  Islamic  law.   The  book  broadly  covers  the  period  up  to  2000,  including  an  examination  of  the  ideology  of  jihad  and  the  use  of  dhimmitude  for  non-Muslims  living  under  the   shari’a.   Bat  Ye’or  writes  that  Islam  has  “a  painful  history  of  hatred,  suffering,  death,  heroism,  betrayal  and  cowardice”.   While  some  argue  that  this  may  be  the  Asian  century,  others  suggest  we  need  to  look  more  closely  at  Islam.  How  will  Muslims  live  in  harmony  with  a  wider  world?   While  this  book  does  not  suggest  how  this  could  be  achieved,  readers  will  have  a  better  understanding  of  another  world.   For  those  who  have  a  negative  view  of  Islam,  this  book  may  further  their  knowledge,  but  will   not  diminish  their  dissonance   about  living  under  an  Islamic  theocracy.   While  Judaism  flourished  under  periods  of  Islamic  rule,  this  is  an  important  contribution  to  understanding  how  Jews  would  fare  under  such  a  system.

"  Why  our  statement  with  Hilaly  is  important   VIEWPOINT   Stephen  Rothman   THE  NSW  Jewish  Board  of   Deputies  was  party  to  an  unprecedented  joint  state  ment  last  week,  dealing  with  rela  tions  between  the  Islamic  and  Jewish  communities  arising  out  of  our  differences  on  the  Middle  East.   Sydney,  more  than  any  other  part  of  Australia,  has  been  subjected  over  the  last  18  months  to  a  level  of  anti  semitic  attacks  which  have  been  of  extreme  concern,  adding  to  the  level  of  insecurity  under  which  the  com  munity  has  suffered  for  some  time.   While  the  Board  has  taken  steps  to  improve  security  for  Jewish  insti  tutions,  the  level  of  antisemitic  vio  lence  has  been  alarming.   At  the  forefront  of  the  agitation  against  the  community  and  repre  sentatives  of  Israel  in  Australia  have  been  extreme  sections  of  the  pro  Palestinian  movement  in  Sydney.   Following  calls  in  the  Middle  East  for  violence  against  Jewish  organisa  tions  in  Israel  and  throughout  the  world,  sections  of  those  supporting  the  Palestinian  cause,  or  persons  using  the  Middle  East  as  an  excuse  to  exacerbate  racial  tension  in  Aus  tralia,  have  perpetrated  acts  of  vio  lence  against  the  Jewish  community.   The  conduct  of  rallies  in  support  of  the  Palestinian  cause  has  been  disturbing,  and  parts  of  the  leader  ship  of  the  Muslim  community  have  repeated  calls  made  overseas  in  a  manner  which  has  sparked  conduct  that  has  been  damaging  and  threat  ening  to  the  Jewish  community.   In  Sydney  we  have  sought  state  ments  from  the  Arab,  Palestinian  or  Muslim  community  deploring  the  violence  against  the  Jewish  commu  nity.  None  of  those  attempts  was  successful  —  until  last  Tuesday.   The  Jewish  community  stands  united  in  its  support  for  Israel  and  the  measures  Israel  is  taking  to  stop  the  violence.  The  community  is  appalled  at  the  murder  and  mayhem  perpetrated  by  Palestinian  terrorists  and  demands  the  ability  of  Israelis  to  live  peacefully  without  threat  of  ter  rorism  and  acts  of  violence.   i  ne  Board  or  Deputies  has  expressed  to  politicians  in  Australia  and  to  the  Prime  Minister  of  Israel  our  full  support  for  Israel  and  the  actions  it  has  been  required  to  take.   It  is  obvious  that  the  leadership  of  the  Palestinian  Authority,  includ  ing  Yasser  Arafat,  is  orchestrating  the  terrorism  and  is  unwilling  to  dis   mantle  the  infrastructure  and  call  a  halt  to  terrorist  activity.  Israel  has  a  right  and  obligation  to  defend  its  security,  its  people  and  its  life.   “When  anyone  makes   comments  in  support  of  easing  racial  tension  and  violence  towards  us,  such   statements  ought  to  be   welcomed.”   In  this  week  of  Shoah  remem  brance,  as  in  every  week,  we  remind  ourselves  that  if  we  will  not  stand  up  for  our  own  people,  no-one  else  will.   The  Board  of  Deputies  has  con  stantly  engaged  opinion  leaders  in  NSW  and  debated  supporters  of  the  Palestinian  cause  to  show  that  Israel   is  doing  no  more  than  protecting  the  only  democracy  in  the  region,  the  only  democracy  which  allows  free  dom  of  religion  and  the  rule  of  law,  and  encourages  tolerance.   On  these  issues,  at  least  in  the  foreseeable  future,  it  is  unlikely  that  we  will  agree  with  Palestinian  sup  porters  in  Sydney  on  the  causes  of  the  problem.   The  leadership  of  the  Palestinian  supporters  and  community  have  been  significantly  silent  on  the  ques   Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  and  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hilaly  at  a  “Unity  in  Adversity”   gathering  at  Government  House  last  November.  Photo:  Ingrid  Shakenovsky   tion  of  suicide  bombing,  murder  of   civilians  or  even  violence  towards  the  local  Jewish  community.   Further,  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hilaly   was  one  of  those  who  had  been  asso   ciated  with  extreme  elements  sup  porting  the  Palestinian  cause.   It  was  with  that  history  that  the  Board  of  Deputies  was  approached  to  issue  a  joint  statement  concerning  a  call  by  the  Islamic  and  Jewish  communities  for  all  Australians  not   to  encourage  violent  behaviour.   The  statement  was  authorised  by  Lebanese  Muslim  Association  vice   president  Keysar  Trad,  Sheikh  Hilaly,  Mufti  of  Australia;  Great  Syna  gogue  Senior  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple;  and  myself.   It  expressed  distress  at  the  esca   lation  of  violence  in  the  Middle  East  and  the  deaths  of  dozens  of  Israelis  and  Palestinians.   The  expression  of  distress  by  the  Islamic  community  in  Sydney  at  the  deaths  of  dozens  of  Israelis  is   unprecedented.  It  makes  clear  that   the  Islamic  and  Jewish  communities   differ  on  the  causes  of  the  conflict  and  how  it  might  be  resolved.   At  the  launch  of  the  media  state  ment,  it  was  made  absolutely  clear  that  the  Board  of  Deputies  and  the  Jewish  community  wholeheartedly  support  Israel  in  defending  its  secu  rity,  and  that  there  was  no  moral  equivalence  between  the  murder  of  citizens  by  terrorist  acts  and  the  unfortunate  deaths  of  civilians  as  a  consequence  of  military  action  in  self-defence.   Further,  it  was  pointed  out  that  “so-called  civilians”  in  a  Palestinian  situation  were  largely  military  and  paramilitary  forces  and  part  of  the   terrorist  infrastructure  which  was   supposed  to  have  been  dismantled  by  the  Palestinian  Authority.   Some  leaders  of  the  Jewish  com  munity,  unaware  of  the  accompany  ing  statements  by  us,  read  parts  of  the  statement  as  less  than  full  sup  port  of  Israel.   But  no  part  of  the  media  adopted  that  interpretation,  perhaps  because  they  heard  the  comments  made  by   us  supplementing  the  statement.   What  was  important  was  obtain  ing  a  statement  from  the  leadership   of  militant  sections  of  the  Islamic  community  that  violence  towards  the  Jewish  community  was  intolera   ble  and  to  be  condemned  without   qualification.   Since  the  release  of  the  state  ment,  Sheikh  Hilaly  has  gone  to  some  lengths,  despite  our  scepti  cism,  to  ensure  that  the  call  for  non  violence  was  repeated  on  a  number  of  occasions.   It  was,  according  to  reports,  repeated  by  Sheikh  Hilaly  at  prayers  at  Lakemba  Mosque  on  Tuesday  night  in  Arabic  and  published  in  Ara  bic  in  the  Arabic  newspapers  An  Nahar,  Al  Buraiq  and  El  Telegraph.  On  each  occasion  he  emphasised  the  need  for  “communal  harmony  with  the  Jewish  community”.   He  made  a  similar  strong  state  ment  against  violence  at  the  rally  in  Sydney  on  Saturday.   These  statements  are  a  complete  turnaround  by  Sheikh  Hilaly  on  the  attitude  to  the  Jewish  community.  Whether  there  is  full  adherence  to  it   by  him  and  his  community,  the  exis  tence  of  the  statement  is  a  significant  advantage  to  the  community.   This  statement  does  not  repre  sent  an  alteration  to  our  overall  view  of  Sheikh  Hilaly.  However,  when  he,  or  anyone  else,  makes  comments  in  support  of  an  easing  of  racial  tension  and  violence,  such  statements  ought  to  be  welcomed.   The  difference  in  tactics  between  some  leaders  of  our  community  must  be  understood  as  that.   We  all  have  the  same  position  on  Israel,  its  security  and  actions.  We  have  the  same  views  on  the  impor  tance  of  our  own  security;  we  some  times  differ  on  the  tactics  to  achieve   our  common  goals.

"  Australia  joins  new  Euro-Asian  Congress   Danya  L@vy   WORLD  Jewry  has  a  new  player  —  the  Euro-Asian  Jewish  Congress.   Delegates  from  15  countries  —  including  Australia,  India,  Japan  and  Mongolia  —  gathered  in  Moscow  recently  at  the  invitation  of  the  Jewish  communities  of  Rus  sia,  Ukraine  and  Kazakhstan.   There  has  been  growing  Jewish  activity  since  the  demise  of  the  Soviet  Union,  said  Executive  Coun  cil  of  Australia  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones,  who  represented   Australia.   In  1998  the  first  new  synagogue  in  80  years  opened.   While  Russia  and  the  Ukraine  had  larger  Jewish  populations,  there  were  many  isolated  commu  nities  in  the  former  Soviet  Union,  he  said.   There  were  Sephardic  and  Ashkenazi  Jews  living  in  countries  where  the  majority  of  people  were  Muslim.  Jews  from  Japan  and  India   lived  with  Buddhists  and  Hindus.   Communism  had  made  it  diffi  cult  for  Jews  to  access  information   about  Israel  and  the  Diaspora,  Mr  Jones  said.  “Australians  are  able  to   be  much  more  involved  with  what  goes  on  in  Israel.  We  have  the  abil  ity  to  learn  and  educate.”   The  former  Soviet  Union  coun   tries  had  to  adopt  a  different  mind  set  after  Communism,  Mr  Jones  said.  “For  years,  to  identify  yourself  as  Jewish  was  an  act  of  courage.”   During  Communism,  the  Aus  tralian  Jewry’s  slogan  had  been  “Let  them  live  or  let  them  leave”,  and  many  people  made  aliyah.   “Jews  in  the  former  Soviet  Union  knew  the  first  country  to  raise  their  plight  with  the  United  Nations  was  Australia.” ",2002-04-19
"  Boycott  France   I  WONDER  if  I  am  the  only  person  to  be  highly  offended  by  the  apparently  increasing  levels  of  antisemitism  of   the  French  Government.   I  would  expect  any  Western  demo  cratic  government  to  offer  its  Jewish  citizens  protection  from  antisemitic  attacks  on  synagogues  and  individu  als.  In  France,  it  appears  that  the  gov  ernment  doesn’t  even  acknowledge  the  problem.   Worse  still,  the  French  Foreign  Minister  is  quoted  as  criticising  US  foreign  policy  by  supporting  Israel  rather  than  the  Arab/Muslim  cause.  He  even  seems  to  characterise  Israel  as  the  aggressor  in  the  Middle  East  conflict  —  a  marginally  better  charac  terisation  than  that  of  his  ambassa  dor  in  London.   French  antisemitism  goes  back  a  long  way,  but  it  seems  time  has  not  mellowed  it.  I  wonder  if  it  is  not  time  for  the  Jewish  community,  both  here  and  overseas,  to  oppose  the  French   Government  in  a  more  overt  manner.   I  already  refuse  to  buy  any  French  product  where  possible,  but  it  would  be  nice  to  see  the  whole  Jewish  Diaspora  boycotting  and  relentlessly  challenging  the  French  Government   until  it  ceases  its  anti-Israel  and  anti  semitic  activities.   Perhaps  I  can  start  the  ball  rolling  through  the  AJN.  How  about  the  Jewish  community  doing  something  to  support  Israel  which  involves  no  more  than  buying  Australian  wine,  non-French  cars  and  holidaying  any  where  else  but  France?   Is  this  too  great  a  sacrifice  for  the   victims  of  terror  in  Israel?   Terry  Davis   Lindfield,  NSW ",2002-02-15
"  Zionism  equals  One  Nation,  says  Campbell   Bernard  Fkreedisian   THE  new  president  of  the  One  Nation  Party,  John  Fischer,  has  endorsed  an  extraordinary  political  tract  that  claims  that  there  are  similarities  between  One  Nation  and  “organised  Jewish  groups”.   Mr  Fischer,  a  One  Nation  member  of  the  Western  Australian  Parliament  and  former  vice  president  of  the  party,  took  over  as  national  president  when  Pauline  Hanson  resigned  last  week.   He  has  written  a  foreword  to  a  document,  Winning  conditions  for  Australian  nationalism,  recom  mending  that  all  Australians  read  it.   The  document,  which  has  a  strong  anti-Asian  and  anti-Muslim  bias,  is  the  work  of  failed  One  Nation  senate  candidate  Graeme  Campbell,  who  says  he  is  still  interested  in  politics  but  has  no  immediate  plans  to  seek  high  office   in  One  Nation.   “I  was  asked  by  members  whether  I  might  seek  the  presidency,  but  was  not  interested,”  Mr  Campbell  told   the  Australian  Jewish  News  this  week.  “1  would  not  rule  it  out.”   Mr  Campbell,  who  describes  himself  as  being  “on  the  moderate  nationalist  side  of  politics”,  said  his  pamphlet  was  being  distributed  to  One  Nation  supporters  and  would  be  shown  on  the  party  website.   In  it  he  repeats  an  accusation  that  World  Jewish  Congress  chairman  Isi  Leibler  showed  hypocrisy  when  he  reportedly  said  in  2000  that  “while  Israel  is  for  the  Jews,  Australians  must  have  multiculturalism”.   “Every  ethnic  group  has  an  interest  in  maintaining  itself,  in  retaining  a  territory  whose  borders  it  controls  and  which  it  calls  home.  This  is  the  cry  of  Zionism,  of  Jews  who  long  for  the  dignity  and  freedom  to  live  among  their  own  people,  to  be  a  secure  majority  in  at  least  one  place  in  the  world.   Australia  is  our  Israel  in  more   ways  than  one.”   He  says  Jewish  commentators   have  long   criticised  his   low-immigration   and  anti  multiculturalism  views.   Graeme  Campbell   “These  critics  refer  to  their   ethnicity  as  a  reason  for  rejecting  our  policies  of  national  interest,  in  particular  our  identification  with  Australia  as  a  predominantly  European  nation  and  the  policies  of  immigration  and  multiculturalism  that  flow  from  that  sentiment.   “These  critics  are  in  effect   criticising  themselves,  or  rather  a   broader  and  more  tolerant  version  of  their  own  frame  of  mind.   “These  critics  are  Jewish  activists   who  belong  to  organised  Jewish   groups.  They  are  similar  to  One  Nation  in  the  strength  of  their  commitment  to  their  people.  They  are  Jewish  patriots,  just  as  we  are  Australian  patriots.  The  main  difference  is  the  object  of  loyalty.  They  care  passionately  about  Jewish  interests,  and  much  of  their  politics  is  predicated  on  that  understandable  ethnic  loyalty.”   Mr  Campbell  attacks  “multicultural  elites”,  regrets  the  demise  of  the  White  Australia  policy  and  declares  that  multiculturalism  and  ethnic  change,  particularly  Asian  immigration,  are  “leading  our  children  and  grandchildren  towards  loss  of  resources,  dignity  and  independence”.   “We  make  no  bones  about  our  ethnic  identification.  Australia  is   populated  mainly  by  people  of  European  descent,  but  that  encompasses  Gentile  and  Jew,   Continued  page  33   Zionism  equals  One  Nation,  says  Campbell   Continued  from  page  3   Catholic  and  Protestant,  Old  and  New  Australians.   “While  we  extend  equal  respect  to  Australians  of  non-European  descent,  Australia  is  predominantly  European  and,  since  Australia  is  a  democratic  country,  our  ethnic  interest  is  a  European  one.   “What  should  we  call  a  situation  where  racial  minorities  are  displacing  our  own  peo  ple  in  the  professions  and  therefore  poised  to  play  a  disproportionate  role  in  governing  the  country?   “In  1996,  Asian-Australians,  mainly  ethnic  Chinese,  won  over  36  per  cent  of  the  top  5000  positions  in  the  New  South  Wales  Higher  School  Certificate  —  an  over-repre  sentation  of  about  500  per  cent.   “Even  without  further  immigration,  the  outcome  will  be  a  disproportionate  Asian   representation  among  Australia’s  profes  sional  and  business  elites  ...  What  is  to  become  of  our  young  people,  who  are  being  pushed  out  of  careers  that  are  legitimately   theirs?”   Mr  Campbell  attacks  Muslims,  quoting  Dr  Kalim  Siddique,  former  director  of  the  Muslim  Institute  in  Britain,  as  saying  the  political  objectives  of  Islam  include  eliminat  ing  “all  authority  other  than  Allah  and  his  prophet”.   It  is  difficult  to  imagine  how  Australian  society  could  be  united  alongside  the  objec  tives  promulgated  by  Dr  Siddique,  he  says.  “The  followers  of  fundamentalist  Islam  express  contempt  for  the  West,  especially  in  relation  to  the  Western  concept  of  multi-cul  turalism.  This  contempt  is  mirrored  by  the  disregard  shown  ...  for  the  wishes  of  the  majority  of  Australian  people.” ",2002-01-25
"  International  K3   Israel  bars  Arafat  from  Bethlehem  mass   Naomi  SegaS   JERUSALEM  —  Israeli  officials  are  preparing  a  PR  campaign  to  defend  their  decision  to  keep  soldiers  in   Bethlehem  over  Christmas.   The  campaign  will  also  deal  with  their  decision  to  bar  Yasser  Arafat,  for  the  second  year  running,  from  attending  midnight  mass  in  the  West  Bank  city.   The  issue  surfaced  as  Israel  scored  a  major  diplomatic  victory  at  the  UN  Security  Council,  which  voted  to  condemn  the  November  28  terror  attacks  on  Israeli  targets  in  Kenya.   Last  week,  President  Moshe  Katsav  came  under  pressure  from  the  pope  and  other  Vatican  officials,  who  pressed  him  to  have  Israeli  soldiers  out  of  Bethlehem  by  Christmas.  During  his  meeting  with  the  pope,  Katsav  said  Israel  would  make  every  effort  to  do  so.   But  on  Sunday,  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  and  the  army  chief  of  staff,  Lieutenant-General  Moshe  Ya’alon,  told  Cabinet  members  that  because  of  continued  terror  warnings  the  army  does  not  plan  to  withdraw  from  the  city.   At  the  same  meeting,  cabinet  ministers  decided  that  Arafat  will  not  be  allowed  to  attend  Christmas  mass  in  Bethlehem.   Israeli  troops  withdrew  from  Bethlehem  in  August  as  part  of  an  initiative  to  gradually  transfer  security  control  in  portions  of  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  Strip  back  to  the  Palestinian  Authority.   But  the  army  returned  following  a   November  terrorist  bombing  in  Jerusalem  that  was  carried  out  by  a  Palestinian  from  Bethlehem.   The  Palestinian  Authority  condemned  the  cabinet’s  decision.  Arafat  aide  Nabil  Abu  Irdeineh  called  it  “a  provocation”  and  a  violation  of  promises  made  to  the  Vatican  and  the  United  States.   Last  year,  Israel  came  under  a  barrage  of  international  criticism  for  barring  Arafat  from  making  the  trip  to  Bethlehem,  after  Arafat  refused  to  hand  over  the  assassins  of  Tourism  Minister  Rehavam  Ze’evi.   “Arafat,  a  Muslim,  had   attended  every  Christmas  mass  in  Bethlehem  since   1995,  a  year  after  the  creation  of  the   Palestinian  Authority.""   Before  that,  Arafat,  a  Muslim,  had  attended  every  Christmas  mass  in  Bethlehem  since  1995,  a  year  after  the  creation  of  the  Palestinian  Authority.   It  is  not  clear  whether  Israel’s  latest  travel  ban  on  Arafat  would  prompt  a  renewed  international  outcry.   The  director  of  the  Prime  Minister’s  Office,  Dov  Weisglass,  was  slated  to  meet  on  Monday  with  Foreign  Ministry  officials  to  discuss   how  Israel  will  mount  its  PR  campaign.   Meanwhile,  Israeli  officials  were  applauding  after  the  UN  Security   Council  condemned  last  month’s  terror  attacks  in  Kenya.   “The  Security  Council  has  never  before  adopted  a  resolution  that  so  clearly  condemns  the  terrorist  killing  of  Israelis  or  Jews,”  Israel’s  deputy  ambassador  to  the  United  Nations,  Aaron  Jacob,  told  the  New  York  Times.   The  executive  director  of  the  American  Jewish  Committee,  David  Harris,  called  the  resolution  “a  diplomatic  and  psychological  break  through”.  He  was  quoted  as  telling  the  Times,  “After  54  years  of  Israel’s  existence,  the  UN  Security  Council,  with  American  leadership,  has  finally  acknowledged  that  the  loss  of  Jewish  lives  in  terrorist  attacks  warrants  condemnation”.   The  resolution  passed  last  Friday  by  a  14-1  vote.  Syria  cast  the  sole  dis  senting  vote.  Three  Israelis  and  10  Kenyans  were  killed  in  the  November  28  suicide  bombing  at  the  Paradise  Hotel  north  of  Mombasa.   Minutes  earlier,  two  shoulder  launched  missiles  narrowly  missed  an  Israeli  charter  plane  taking  off  from  Mombasa  airport  for  Tel  Aviv.   Last  month,  a  spokesman  for  al  Qaeda  claimed  responsibility  for  the  Kenya  attacks  and  vowed  more  terror  to  retaliate  for  Israel’s  treat  ment  of  the  Palestinians.   But  over  the  weekend,  Arafat  sought  to  distance  the  Palestinian  Authority  from  al-Qaeda.

Israel  will  not  allow  Yasser  Arafat  into  Bethlehem  for  next  week’s   Christmas  Mass.  Photo:  Brian  Hendler/JTA   In  an  interview  with  the  London   Sunday  Times,  Arafat  said  Osama  bin  Laden  is  exploiting  Palestinian  suffering  to  garner  support  in  the   Arab  world.   “Why  is  Bin  Laden  talking  about  Palestine  now?  Bin  Laden  never,  not  ever,  stressed  this  issue,  he  never  helped  us,  he  was  working  in   another  completely  different  area  and  against  our  interests,”  Arafat  was  quoted  as  saying.   Israeli  officials,  including  Sharon,  have  recently  charged  that  al-Qaeda  operatives  have  set  up  bases  in  Palestinian-controlled  areas,  a  claim  denied  by  the  Palestinian  Authority.

"  Tributes  flow  for  Ira  Magid   AtenaRossatam   A  WOMAN  of  strong  conviction  who  was  not  afraid  to  voice  her  opinion.  A  dedi  cated  peacenik.   These  were   among  the  many  tributes  for  Rebecca   (Ira)  Magid  that  poured  in  this  week  from  friends  and  prominent  commu  nity  members.   Mrs  Magid  died  in  Melbourne  last  Friday,  aged  82.

A  staunch  Zionist,  she  recently  returned  from  a  trip  to  Israel.  Temple  Beth  Israel  Emer  itus  Rabbi  John  Levi,  a  long-time  friend,  called  her  “a  beautiful  person”.   “She  was  a  woman  of  strong  beliefs  and  opinions.

Many  great  personalities  were  guests  around  her   table.”   Renate  Kamener,  a  member  of  the  Aus  tralian  Jewish  Democratic  Society  executive,  described  Mrs  Magid  as  a  “remarkable  woman”  and  recalled  her  support  for  Salaam  Shalom,  a  group  for  Jewish  and  Muslim   women.   “She  was  very  strong-minded  and  fol  lowed  absolutely  and  unequivocally  what  she  thought  was  the  right  thing  to  do,.and  wasn’t  hindered  by  popular  opinion.”   Rebecca  Qra)  Magid  was  bom  in  1920  in  Harbin,  China,  to  Russian  emigres.

"  Muslim  saves  shut   NEW  YORK  —  A  Muslim  from  Pakistan  helped  save  a  Brooklyn  synagogue.

The  man  called  police  when  he  saw  the  second  person  dous  ing  the  synagogue  with  the  gaso  line.  Police  soon  arrived  at  the  scene  and  arrested  the  alleged  perpetrator,  who  said  he  want  ed  to  “get  back  at  the  Jews”.

"  Muslim  faces  life  in  jail   RICHARD  ALLEN  GREENE   LONDON  -  British  Jews  have  wel  comed  the  hate  crimes  conviction  of  a  radical  Muslim  preacher  who  urged  his  followers  to  kill  Jews,   Hindus  and  westerners.   Sheik  Abdullah  Faisal  was  con  victed  last  week  on  three  counts  of   inciting  murder,  as  well  as  charges  of  using  threatening  or  abusive  lan  guage  and  of  distributing  recordings   of  his  threats.   During  a  trial  that  lasted  a  month  at  London’s  Old  Bailey,  prosecutors  showed  a  videotape  of  Faisal  making  jokes  about  the  Holocaust  in  a  public  meeting.   “How  did  the  Jews  get  back  at  Hitler?  They  sent  him  the  gas  bill,”   the  cleric  said.   Islamic  bookstores  sold  records   ings  of  Faisali  lectures  with  titles  including  “No  peace  with  the  Jews”,  “Jewish  traits”  and  “Them  versus  us”.   A  spokesman  for  Britain’s  Community  Security  Trust,  a  Jewish  security  organisation,  welcomed  the   conviction  and  said  law  enforcement   officials  must  keep  up  the  pressure   on  Islamic  extremists.   “The  judicial  authorities  must  continue  to  prosecute  hate  from  wherever  it  comes,  and  those  who  claim  a  religious  belief  in  calling  for  the  killing  of  others  should  take  note  of  this  important  conviction,”  said  the  spokesman,  who  spoke  to  JTA  on  customary  condition  of  anonymity.   He  added  that  the  Jewish  com  munity  hopes  authorities  will  show  no  “hesitation  in  prosecuting  those  Islamists  who  have  been  embold  ened  by  calls  from  Islamist  extrem  ists  from  abroad  and  who  abuse  the  freedoms  that  residence  in  Britain  allows  them”.   Faisal  was  prosecuted  under  a  rarely  used  Victorian  law,  the  Offenses  Against  the  Person  Act.   He  faces  a  maximum  of  life  imprisonment.  He  is  due  to  be  sentenced  on  March  7.   In  an  unusual  step,  the  judge  in  the  case  barred  Jews,  Hindus  and  their  spouses  from  serving  on  the  jury.   Faisal,  39,  was  born  William  Forest  in  Jamaica.  He  con  verted  to  Islam  at  16  and  took  an  Islamic  studies  course  in  Riyadh,   Saudi  Arabia.   JTA  l ",2003-03-07

"  Moderates  must  challenge  extremists  -  Muslim  leader   DAN  GOLDBERG   THE  voices  of  extremists  must  be  challenged  by  the  moderate  majority  on  both  sides,  the  president  of  the  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria  (ICV)  said  last  week.   Addressing  a  packed  Jewish  National  Fund  luncheon,  Yasser  Soliman,  42,  warned  that  the  silence  of  the  moderate  majority  poses  a  danger.   “Our  silence  in  many  cases  is  seen  as  consent  and  support  [for  extrem  ism].  It  is  everyone’s  duty  to  make  sure  the  next  generation  has  full  opportunities  and  that  the  voice  of  extremism  is  not  proved  right,”  he  said.   “If  all  we  are  doing  is  demonising  each  other  ...  we  are  heading  in  the  wrong  direction.”   The  Jewish  and  Muslim  commu  nities  need  to  build  bridges  to  allay  their  mutual  fears,  he  urged.   “Many  people  in  the  Muslim  community  are  afraid  about  what  the  Jewish  people  has  got  planned  for  them.  You  are  probably  very  fright  ened  about  what  you  think  we  have  got  planned  for  you.   “As  far  as  Islamic  Council  of  Vic   toria  is  concerned...  they  want  noth  ing  more  than  what  you  want:  peace,  security  and  the  opportunity  to  raise  your  kids.”   Born  in  Cairo,  Soliman  arrived  in  Australia  in  1969,  and  in  1999  was  elected  to  the  Victorian  peak  Islamic  body,  which  represents  about  30  Islamic  groups.   According  to  the  2001  Census,  there  are  281,578  Muslims  in  Australia.   “If  all  we  are  doing  is   demonising  each  other   ...  we  are  heading  in  the  wrong  direction.”   YASSER  SOLIMAN  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria   Asked  about  the  self-described   Grand  Mufti  of  Australia,  Sydney’s  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hilaly,  who  last  January  was  reported  legitimising  suicide  bombings,  Soliman  said  Hilaly  “does  not  represent  -  and  shouldn’t  be  seen  as  representing  -  anybody  except  himself.   “He  has  no  binding  say  on  the  Muslim  community  in  Australia.”   Rejecting  terrorism  as  “against  the  teachings  of  Islam”,  Soliman  pointed  to  a  statement  issued  by  the  ICV  on  November  6,2002  which  denounced  “aggression  and  violence  against  innocent  people”.   “[The  ICV]  will  continue  to  con  demn  it,”  he  maintained.   Soliman  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News  that  he  condemned  last  week’s   attacks  on  a  shul  in  Sydney  and  the  Jewish  Museum  in  Melbourne.   “I  have  no  hesitation  condemning  any  such  attacks  on  any  places  of  worship.  This  must  not  be  the  way  we  express  ourselves.”   Dismissing  any  suggestion  that   Muslim  children  in  Australia  are   taught  to  hate  Jews,  he  said:  “There  is   no  school  I  know  of  in  Australia  that   has  anything  in  its  curriculum  that  is  anti-anybody,  Jewish  or  otherwise.”   But  he  said  there  are  people  in  both  communities  “teaching  the  ways  of  hate”.   Discussing  the  Middle  East,   Soliman  accused  “sections  of  the   media”  of  generating  “fears  and  sus  picions”  among  both  communities  in  Australia.  “We  need  to  take  every  opportunity  to  break  the  hostilities.”   Asked  whether  the  ICV  recog   Yasser  Soliman:  “[Sheikh  Hilaiy]  does  not  represent  anybody  except  himself.”   Photo:  Dean  Schmideg   nised  the  right  of  Israel  to  exist  with  in  secure  borders,  Soliman  said:  “Jew  ish  people  have  a  right  to  live  in  the  Middle  East,  and  not  just  in  Israel,  but  amongst  us.”   Endorsing  Soliman  s  call  for  increased  dialogue  between  the  two  communities,  newly-elected  Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victoria  president  Michael  Lipshutz  said  such  a  meeting  with  an  Islamic  leader   would  have  been  inconceivable  10  years  ago.   “We  don’t  have  to  agree;  we  need  to  speak,  exchange  views,  under  stand  each  other,”  he  said,  adding  that  he  looks  forward  to  the  day  he  is  invited  to  address  the  Islamic  community.

"  Extremist  Muslim  group  forms  in  Holland   RACHEL  LEW   AMSTERDAM  -  An  antisemitic  Bel   gian  Muslim  organisation  is  spreading  its  influence  in  Holland,  where  it  plans   to  run  in  local  elections.   The  Arab  European  League  was  established  in  Belgium  in  2000  to  “strengthen  Arab  and  Muslim  identi  ty”  and  fight  against  perceived  dis  crimination  against  Arabs  and   Muslims.   Earlier  this  month  the  league  opened  a  branch  in  Holland.  At  the  end  of  a  week  of  lectures  by  the  league’s  extremist  leader,  the  Lebanese-born  Dyab  Abu  Jahja,  the  league  announced  that  it  had  signed   up  some  600  members  in  Holland  and  plans  to  run  as  a  political  party  in   local  elections  scheduled  for  2006.   Abu  Jahja,  31,  aroused  the  suspi  cions  of  Belgium’s  government  last  year  with  his  extremist  remarks.  Apart  from  advocating  Arab  rights  and  demanding  that  Arabic  be  recognised  as  an  official  Belgian  language,  the  for  mer  Hezbollah  fighter  incited  Moroc  can  immigrants  to  riot  against  local  Belgians  and  Jews.   He  also  calls  for  the  destruction  of  Israel  and  the  end  of  what  he  calls  the   “Israeli-American  imperialist  world  domination  of  the  last  50  years”.   Both  Holland  and  Belgium  have  large  Muslim  immigrant  populations.   Some  1000  people  in  Belgium  have  joined  the  league,  officials  claim.   The  establishment  of  the  Dutch  wing  of  the  Arab  European  League  attracted  broad  attention  among  Hol  land’s  Moroccan  community,  as  well  as  from  society  at  large.   For  over  a  week,  Abu  Jahja  lectured  at  universities,  community  centres  and  debating  halls  around  the  coun  try.  His  tour  aroused  heated  debate  from  the  beginning.   In  an  interview  in  the  prestigious  NRC  Handelsblad,  one  of  the  league’s  board  members,  Naima  Elmaslouhi,  23,  expressed  understanding  for  slo  gans  like  “Hamas,  Hamas,  put  the   Jews  in  the  gas.

Stereotyping  of  the   Arab  in  modern  Hebrew  literature   is  no  better  than  stereotyping  of  the  Jew  in  Arab  literature.”   Chairman  of  the  Department  of   Arabic  and  Islamic  Studies  at  the   University  of  Sydney,  Professor  Shboul  was  giving  the  first  2003  talk  in  the  temple’s  “I  Speak  my  Mind”  series,  presented  by  the  temple  group  Jews  for  Social  Action.   “There  is  a  perception  among  Arabs  and  Palestinians  that  they  are  paying  for  Jewish  history,”  he  said.   “You  have  to  see  the  degree  of  oppression  to  which  Palestinians  are  subjected  by  Israel.  Security  concerns  are  justified,  but  it’s  too  heavy-handed,  which  creates  more  extremism  on  the  Palestinian  side.”   Rejecting  a  suggestion  from  the   Rabbi  Richard  Lampert,  professor  Anmaa  anooui.   audience  that  Palestinian  refugees  have  been  used  as  political  pawns,  he  questioned  why  Israel  “is  still  pursuing  a  policy  of  attracting  Jew  ish  immigrants”.   “It  is  a  paradox  that  according  to  Israeli  law,  if  you  are  Jewish  you  have  the  right  to  go  there  and  become  a  citizen;  but  if  you  are  Palestinian  Arab  -  even  if  you  are  born  there  -  you  don’t  have  that  right  of  return.   “The  sooner  fundamentalist  Jews  from  the  US  leave  Israel,  the  better,”  he  added.

"  Jewish-Muslim  friendship  in  Sharif  film   TOMTUGEND   LOS  ANGELES  -  “I  was  filming  Funny  Girl  with  Barbra  Streisand  in  1967  when  the  Six-Day  War  broke  out  and  the  Arab  press  called  me  a  traitor  for  kissing  a  Jewish  woman,”   reminisced  veteran  actor  Omar  Sharif.   “When  I  told  Barbra  about  it,”  Sharif  added,  “she  said,  ‘You  should  see  the  letter  my  aunt  wrote  about  kissing  an  Arab  man!’”   Sharif’s  latest  film,  Monsieur  Ibrahim,  is  a  love  story  of  a  different  kind  between  an  elderly  Muslim  and  an  abandoned  Jewish  boy.   It  screened  during  this  year’s  Jew  ish  film  festival  and  is  expected  to  be  released  in  cinemas  next  year.   Sharif  s  title  character  is  the  owner   of  a  small  food  market  on  a  seedy  Paris  street,  where  Orthodox  Jews  do  their  best  to  ignore  the  parade  of  prostitutes  and  their  customers.   In  a  small  apartment  above  the  street  lives  16-year-old  Moise,  nick  named  Momo.  Abandoned  by  his  mother,  Momo  lives  with  his  morose  father,  cooking  his  meals  and  driving  him  crazy  with  ear-splitting  rock   music  on  a  transistor  radio.   Momo  also  does  the  shopping  for  the  truncated  family  at  Ibrahim’s  market  and  rationalises  his  petty  thievery  there  because  he  believes  it’s  all  right  to  steal  from  an  Arab.   Ibrahim  is  actually  not  an  Arab,  but  a  Turkish  Muslim  who  imparts  philosophical  musings  from  his  per   sonalised  interpretation  of  the  Koran  to  the  boy.   Momo  is  Jewish,  but  he  links  the  faith  of  his  ancestors  mainly  to  his  father’s  depression.  When  the  father  walks  out  on  the  boy  to  find  a  job,  Momo’s  only  friend  -  outside  of  the   hookers  whom  he  has  started  to   patronise  -  is  Ibrahim.   Despite^moving  performances  by  Sharif  and  by  Pierre  Boulanger  as  Momo,  and  director  Francois  Dupey  ron’s  description  of  the  picture  as  “a  hymn  to  tolerance,  a  cry  for  hope”,  the   French  film  suffers  from  excessive   sentimentality.   I  The  lesson  of  the  film   is  that  “we  can  live   together  and  can  love  |  each  other”.   I  OMAR  SHARIF   Actor   Jewish  viewers  may  also  feel  uneasy  by  the  contrast  between  Ibrahim’s  strong  Muslim  faith  and  the  way  Momo  views  his  Judaism  as  meaningless.   Sharif  seemed  taken  aback  by  the  last  observation.  “The  only  objection  I  heard  from  French  Jews  was  that  no  Jewish  mother  would  ever  abandon  her  child,”  he  said.   At  71,  Sharif  is  greyer  and  more  pensive  than  when  he  broke  women’s  hearts  from  Cairo  to  Los  Angeles,  but  he  is  still  a  handsome  and  well-built   Veteran  actor  Omar  Sharif  in  the  French  film  Monsieur  Ibrahim.

Already  a  star  in  his  native  Egypt,  he  came  to  Hollywood  in  1962,  and  during  the  following  six  years  won   international  fame  in  three  movies:   he  played  an  Arab  desert  warrior  in  Lawrence  of  Arabia,  the  title  role  in  Dr  Zhivago  and  a  Jewish  gambler  in  Funny  Girl.   Since  then,  he’s  mainly  been   involved  in  films  considered  second  rate.  Bom  Catholic  but  later  convert   ing  to  Islam,  Sharif  is  widely  read  and   has  followed  the  Arab-Israeli  conflict   with  great  interest  and  sorrow.   He  still  considers  Egyptian  presi  dent  Anwar  Sadat’s  1977  peace  mis  sion  to  Israel  as  “the  greatest  moment  in  television  history,  greater  than  man  stepping  on  the  moon”.   In  Cairo  in  the  late  1970s,  Sharif  met  Ariel  Sharon,  who  urged  the  actor  to  visit  his  many  fans  in  Israel,  but  Sharif  said  he  does  not  plan  to  take  up  the  invitation  until  there  is  “a  glimmer  of  peace”.   His  views  on  an  Israeli-Palestinian   settlement  parallel  those  of  such  dovish  Israelis  as  Yossi  Beilin,  but  Sharif  holds  out  littie  hope  for  peace   soon.   He  expects  that  his  new  film’s  mes  sage  will  resonate  in  Israel,  where  local  distributors  purchased  the  film  for  the  highest  price  they  ever  paid  for  a  French  import.   If  viewers  take  anything  away  from  the  movie,  he  hopes  it  will  be  the  les  son  that  “we  can  live  together  and  can   love  each  other.   JTA ",2003-11-28
"  Bid  to  block  Jewish  Muslim  forum   ALANA  ROSENBAUM   A  RABBI  and  a  Muslim  academic  will  debate  religion  next  week  at  a  controversial  forum  on  Islam  and  Judaism.

Rapoport  said  he  expects  the  audience  to  ask  questions  on  Israel.   “The  program  revolves  around  the  two  religions,  but  I  have  told  Saeed  ‘you  are  going  to  get  in  the  audience  Jews  who  are  going  to  sound  vexatious’,”  he  said.

"  Australian  Muslim  leaders  downplay  offensive  remarks   AVIVA  BARD   AUSTRALIAN  Muslim  leaders  have   sought  to  downplay  Malaysian  Prime   Minister  Mahathir  Mohamad’s  anti   semitic  speech  at  a  conference  of  Islamic  leaders  last  week,  refuting  suggestions  that  he  was  urging  a  war  on  the  Jews.   Among  other  offensive  remarks,  Mahathir  said:  “The  Jews  rule  the  world  by  proxy  ...  they  get  others  to  fight  and  die  for  them...”   Responding  to  comments  which  which  have  been  compared  to  being  “in  the  tradition  of  a  Hitler  or  a  Stal  in”,  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  (AFIC)  CEO  Amjad  Mehboob  said  that  “at  no  stage  are  Muslims  contemplating  any  form  of  action  against  the  Jews  or  trying  to   finish  them  off”.   “I  don’t  believe  he’s  calling  for  a  war  against  the  Jews.  He  referred  to  the  problem  of  Palestine  and  the  con  flict  between  the  Palestinians  and  the  people  of  Israel.   “If  anybody  were  to  say  the  Jewish  people  should  be  put  to  death,  he   Australia  Fair  (formerly  Australian   Muslim  News)  editor  Kuranda  Seyit   should  be  condemned.  I  don’t  believe  he  was  saying  that,”  Mehboob  said.   “I  would  condemn  anyone  who  said  Muslims  should-take  up  arms  against  the  Jewish  people  or  that  the  Jews  don’t  have  a  right  to  exist   “I  think  he’s  saying  we  should  stop  fighting  and  find  a  solution.   “Governments  around  the  world  have  accepted  that  Israel  has  a  right  to  exist  side-by-side  with  the  Palestinians.   “I’m  not  defending  what  he  said.  When  you  hear  Muslims  saying  the  Jew   rules  the  world,  what  they  mean  is  that  despite  that  they  are  not  so  great  in  numbers,  the  Jewish  community  have  a  far  greater  influence  in  the  world.   “We  are  looking  at  a  resolution  of   the  conflict  with  a  Muslim  state  and   an  Israeli  state  where  the  two  people  will  live  side-by-side  in  peace.   “He  [Mahathir]  started  his  speech  with  some  very  scathing  self-criticism   and  criticism  of  Muslim  leaders.”   AFIC  president  Dr  Ameer  Ali  said   Mahathir’s  comments  should  not  be   misinterpreted  to  suggest  Muslims  were  opposed  to  Jews  or  were  to  take  up  arms  against  them.   Dr  Ali  added  that  while  he  was  not   speaking  on  behalf  of  the  Prime  Min  ister,  he  did  not  believe  Mahathir  was  preaching  a  war  on  the  Jews  or  on  Israel,  but  referring  to  “the  unprece  dented  power  and  influence  of  the  small  number  of  Jewish  people  in  international  affairs”,  compared  to  1.3  billion  Muslims  who  were  unable  to  exercise  real  power  and  influence  and  that  the  Muslims  needed  to  learn  from  the  Jews,  who  had  survived  2000  years  of  “pogroms”.

Adding  that  Mahathir  was  expressing  the  frustration  of  Muslims  regarding  the  suffering  of  the  Pales   tinians  and  the  West’s  failure  to  find  a  solution,  Dr  Ali  said  Muslims  have  accepted  Israel  and  want  Palestinians   to  have  their  own  state  and  for  the   two  peoples  to  live  in  peace.   Islamic  Council  ofVictoria  human   rights  co-ordinator  Bilal  Cleland:  “We  want  to  extend  positive  relations  to  all   faith  communities  and  not  to  associ   ate  the  whole  community  with  par   ticular  policies”   “We  understand  why  Mahathir  and  Malaysia  would  be  upset  with  the   Israeli  Government  because  of   Sharons  policies,  but  to  extend  that  to  the  world  Jewish  community  is  uncceptable  Islamically  and  democratically.”   Australia  Fair  (formerly  Australian  Muslim  News)  editor  Kuranda  Seyit:  “It’s  an  absurd  notion  to  brand  a  whole  global  community  under  one  agenda.

"  Muslim,  Jewish   students  compare  dreams  and  hopes   JACQUI  GAL   WHILE  Middle  East  politicians  are  steering  clear  of  the  negotiating  table,  a  growing  number  of  Australian  Jewish  students  are  meeting  for  discussions  with  their  Muslim  counterparts.   The  most  recent  occasion  was  an  afternoon  of  conversation,  coffee  and  cake  between  Year  11  and  12  students  from  Noor  A1  Houda  Islamic  College   in  Condell  Park  and  Emanuel  School  at  the  Emanuel  campus.   Mixing  easily,  the  students  chatted  and  mingled,  almost  indistinguishable  in  their  identical  maroon  school  uni   forms  —  the  hijab  (head  covering)  worn  by  the  female  Muslim  students  notwithstanding.   The  exchange  was  arranged  by  Emanuel  captain  Toolie  Fester  and  prefect  Michael  Edwards,  who  were  inspired  by  a  Mount  Scopus  College  outreach  program  in  Melbourne.   “There’s  something  significant  about  these  two  groups  meeting  because  we  re  both  ethnic  minorities,”  Edwards  said.  “We  both  suffer  from   being  stereotyped  and  from  ignorance,  and  we  can  try  to  break  that  down,  particularly  at  our  young  age.”   Emanuel  student  Aviva  Pinkus  -   who  participated  in  a  Moriah  College  outreach  forum  earlier  this  year,  at  which  students  from  12  schools  gath   ered  to  discuss  discrimination  -  noted  that  “in  our  normal  lives  we  wouldn’t  have  the  opportunity  to  be  one-on-one  with  students  from  an  Islamic  school”.   Two  representatives  of  Emanuel  and  Noor  A1  Houda  each  made  pre  sentations  on  being  part  of  an  ethnic  minority  in  Australia.   “Being  Jewish  is  filled  with  mixed  experiences,”  Fester  said.  “We  hear  about  the  beauty  of  our  multicultural  society,  but  there  is  no  complete  respect  for  those  who  are  a  minority”   Representing  the  Islamic  school,  school  captain  Carawan  Ghanem  agreed-  “To  be  an  ethnic  minority  in  Australia  is  not  difficult,  but  to  be  one  that  is  misunderstood  is  a  challenge.   “My  friends  and  I  have  dreams  of  rising  and  being  seen  in  the  communi  ty  with  a  positive  image  and  integrity.  We  have  the  same  hopes  and  dreams  as   other  Australians.”   Both  groups  expressed  concerns  that  their  achievements  may  be  tainted  with  negative  remarks  about  their  eth  nic  identities,  with  Emanuel  students  singling  out  stereotypes  which  lead  to   antisemitism.   “In  public  schools,  many  Jewish  students  come  across  a  lack  of  under  standing,”  Fester  added  -  “not  borne  out  of  something  sinister,  but  out  of  ignorance.  We  hope  to  minimise  this.”   “We  both  suffer  from   being  stereotyped,  and  we  can  try  to  break  that  !  down.”   i  MICHAEL  EDWARDS   Emanuel  School  prefect   Muslim  student  Chayma  Elbat  stressed  her  wish  to  see  Arabs  and  Jews  live  in  peace.  “For  thousands  of  years  Jews  and  Muslims  lived  in  peace  in  the  Holy  Land,  so  to  say  it’s  not  possible  is  to  deny  history.  It  is  my  fervent  hope  there  will  be  peace  in  the  Holy  Land.”   Noor  A1  Houda  principal  Silma  Ihram  was  one  of  the  founders  of  the   first  Muslim  school  in  Sydney,  A1  Noori,  in  1983  -  coincidentally,  the  same  year  Emanuel  opened  its  doors.   Expressing  the  hope  that  the  meet  ing  would  be  replicated,  Fester  invited  students  to  exchange  emails.  Some   Emanuel  students  have  since  had  fre  quent  on-line  contact  with  their  Noor  A1  Houda  acquaintances.

"  Muslim  growth  poses  a  threat,  warns  professor   ALANA  ROSENBAUM   THE  rapid  growth  of  Australia’s  Muslim  population  poses  a  serious  threat  to  the  Jewish  community,  a  vis  iting  historian  warned  this  week.   Dr  Bill  Rubinstein  said  that  as  the  Muslim  community  swells,  it  will  hold  greater  sway  over  policy-makers  in   Canberra.   “They  are  going  to  be  absolutely  pro-Palestinian  and  anti-Israel  in  everything  they  say  on  the  Arab-Israeli  conflict,  and  who  do  you  think  the  government  in  Canberra  is  going  to  listen  to?  Obviously,  the  vastly  larger  Muslim  community,”  he  said.   There  are  three  times  as  many  Muslims  in  Australia  than  Jews,  but  the  Muslim  community  (281,578,  according  to  the  2001  Census)  is  expanding  more  rapidly  than  its  Jewish  counterpart  (83,993)  and  by  2033,  Australia  would  be  home  to  one  million  Muslims,  he  predicted.   “There  is  dead  certain  to  be  half-a   million  Muslims  here  within  10  to  15   years  and  a  million  within  30.  When  they  have  been  here  for  generations  and  are  a  million-strong  and  have  developed  articulate  leadership,  this  is  going  to  be  an  enormously  harmful  influence  on  the  Jewish  community.”   Dr  Rubinstein  is  the  author  of  The   Jews  of  Australia,  which  spans  the  end  of  World  War  II  to  the  early  1990s.   The  US-born  scholar  was  professor  of  Social  and  Economic  History  at  Deakin  University  in  Geelong,  before  taking  up  a  teaching  position  at  the  University  of  Wales,  Aberystwyth.   Dr  Rubinstein  said  Australian   Jewry  is  one  of  the  “healthiest”  Diaspora  communities  in  the  world  in  terms  of  likelihood  to  marry,  have  children  and  remain  Jewish.   He  disputed  a  report  that  intermar  riage  had  soared  by  20  per  cent  in  the  past  three  years,  saying  it  had  increased  by  just  over  two  per  cent.

"  Freedom  fries  and  Muslim  up   Emma  Young   The  Mecca  Cola  has  been  drunk,  the  Yasser  Arafat  cheesy  poof  crunched  on,  French  fries  have  been  labelled  too  French,  and  the  international  food  fight  is  on.  Yes,  the  language  of  international  diplomacy  now  has  a  calorie  count  as  organisations  around  the   world  make  their  political  moves  via  the  vocabulary  of  the  five  food  groups.  In  the  current  climate  of  geopolitical  instability,  many  important  political  decisions  have  been  made  whose  consequences  have  changed  the  world  forever,  none  more  so  than  America's  renaming  of  a  potato  chip.  It  was  earlier  in  the  year,  at  the  time  of  lasting  French  opposition  to  planned  US  military  action  in  Iraq,  that  America  made  the  congressionally  determined  and  not  intentionally  humorous  move  of  replacing  the  'French'  in  French  fry  with  'freedom.'  Good  one  America.  If  they  couldn't  do  it  at  the  negotiating  table,  fast  food  menus  were  clearly  the  next  best  place  to  fight  about  a  military  invasion.  Despite  the  pettiness  of  this  action,  the  American  public  appreciated  the  Continentally  directed  finger  gesture  this  great  change  in  fast  food  vernacular  represented.  And  now  as  the  United  States  government  about  turn  and  attempt  to  buddy  up  with,  or  at  least  gain  cooperation  from  the  European  nation,  certain  members  of  Congress  are  again  looking  to  the  chip,  this  time  suggesting  a  return  to  normality,  from  the  politically  strident  'freedom'  back  to  the  traditional  'French'.  Who  said  superpowers  ever  lose  perspective?  While  the  brilliance  of  this  gastronomic  diplomacy  might  understandably  appear  to  be  a  phenomenon  particular  to  America,  The  Fattest  Nation  in  the  World,  it  is  a  method  of  historically  and  globally  proven  merit.  People  have  been  getting  topical  with  all  things  tasty  for  years.  The  Palestinians  made  a  bite-sized  cheesy  poof  out  of  Yasser  and  sold  it  at  all  reputable  street  Tenders  in  order  to  'introduce  the  Palestinian  issue  to  the  largest  amount  of  people  possible.'  Chinese  officials  punished  a  visiting  Israeli   contingent  for  the  cancellation  of  a  $1  billion  aircraft  deal  by  dishing  out  pork.  Cadbury's  Temptations  in  India  recently  ran  a  campaign  that  compared  the  desirability  of  their  chocolate  with  the  disputed  territory  of  Kashmir  under  the  tagline,  ""I'm  good.  I'm  tempting.  I'm  too  good  to  share.""  And  now  there  is  a  brand  new  range  of  cola  companies  touting  their  products  as  commitment  in  a  can.  Mecca  Cola,  Qibla  Cola,  Zamzam  Cola  and  Muslim  Up  are  all  newly  created  and  religiously  empathetic  soft  drinks  designed  to  satisfy  the  tastes  of  a  market  of  Muslim  consumers  who  no  longer  want  to  buy  American.  With  campaign  slogans  such  as  'no  more  drinking  stupid,  drink  committed',  these  new  colas  have  facilitated  not  only  a  whole  lot  of  thirst  quenching,  but  also  associated   themselves  with  the  popular  political  pastime  of  boycotting.  The  people  of  the  countries  in  which  these  products  are  sold,  including  Saudi  Arabia,  Yemen,  Palestine,  and  France,  are  now  finding  themselves  able  to  buy  in  accordance  with  their  political  agendas  without  sacrificing  the  fizzy  excitement  of  a  soft  drink  sensation.  Perhaps  Osama  bin  Laden  can  convert  from  his  favourite  drink  of  Pepsi  (a  Saudi  journalist  interviewing  him  in  a  Tora  Bora  cave  noticed  cases  of  the  stuff),  and  get  with  the  program  of  slamming  it  down  hard  for  Islam.  While  the  history  of  international  politics  has  often  strayed  into  the  idiotic  (George  Bush  Snr.  vomiting  on  the  Japanese  Prime  Minister,  John  Howard  power  walking  in  America)  cheesy  poofs,  freedom  fries  and  Muslim  Up  might  have  just  set  a  new  standard.

With  a  $1  million  budget  dictating  that  the  150  scenes  that  comprise  Mushin’s  script  must  be  shot  in  a  mere  27  days,  meal  breaks  are  the   least  of  his  concerns.   It’s  day  11  of  the  shoot,  which   utilises  more  than  40  locations   around  Melbourne,  and  filming  is  taking  place  in  an  apartment  building  in  Park  Street,  South  Yarra.   Mushin,  39,  who  became  well  known  for  his  roles  in  the  classic  Australian  film  Strictly  Ballroom  and  the  popular  TV  series  Frontline,   admits  that  it  has  been  stressful  making  Josh  Jarman.   “We  are  just  aware  that  there  is  so  much  work  to  do.  Once  we  get  all  the  footage  in  the  can  at  the  end  of  the  shoot  we’ll  be  much  more  relaxed,”  he  said.   Just  getting  to  the  production  stage  of  the  film  has  involved  a  lot  of   work.   The  script,  which  received  development  funding  from  the  Australian  Film  Commission,  was  more  than  two  years  in  the  making.   It  follows-  the  fortunes  of  a   playwright  named  Josh  Jarman  who  has  one  wish:  to  have  his  play  produced  in  a  respectable  theatre.   A  successful  producer  volunteers  his  services  and  sets  about  turning  Josh’s  “tragic  love  story”  into  a  “tacky,   cliched  musical”.   Mushin,  who  cut  his  teeth  on  stage  at  Monash  University  and  worked  with  the  Saltpiller  Theatre  Company,  said  that  many  people  assume  the   Director  Pip  Mushin  (right)  and  producer  Eva  Orner  on  the  set  of  Josh  Jarman.   Photo:  Bindy  Edelman   film  is  based  on  his  own  experiences.   “Maybe  subconsciously  there  are  certain  parallels,”  he  admits.  “Other  people  would  argue  that  consciously  it’s  completely  about  stories  in  my   life”   “A  lot  of  the  shtick   between  Graham's   character  Josh  and  his  flatmate  Russ  is  that   Jewish  New  York  shtick.""   PIP  MUSHIN   Director   After  numerous  drafts  of  the   script,  Mushin  set  about  raising  inde  pendent  finance.  Utilising  contacts  in  the  business  world  he  single-handed  ly  raised  the  films  $1  million  budget  without  government  assistance  -  a  feat  his  producer  Eva  Orner,  33,  describes  as  “absolutely,  gobsmack  ingly  extraordinary”.   Orner,  who  graduated  from  Mount  Scopus  a  few  years  after   Mushin,  is  no  stranger  to  amazing  feats  herself.  At  24  she  produced  her  first  documentary,  Untold  Desires,   and  was  rewarded  with  Australian   Film  Institute,  Logie  and  Australian  Human  Rights  awards.  She  has  gone  on  to  produce  films  and  TV  series.   Heavily  influenced  by  American  Jewish  comedians  like  Jerry  Seinfeld,  Mel  Brooks  and  Woody  Allen,  Mushin  says  audiences  will  be  pleas  antly  surprised  by  lead  actor  Marcus  Graham’s  aptitude  for  comedy.   “A  lot  of  the  shtick  between  Gra  ham’s  character  Josh  and  his  flatmate  Russ  is  that  Jewish  New  York  shtick.”   The  calibre  of  actors  in  the  film  -   including  Daniela  Farinacci,  who  was   nominated  for  an  AFI  award  for  her   performance  in  Lantana  -  belies  the  notion  that  the  film  is  low  budget.   Mushin  believes  actors  feel  “relaxed”  with  him  as  a  director  because  of  his  own  acting  experience.   “It’s  a  big  ambitious  project,”  Orner  said.  The  film  is  expected  to  be  released  next  year. ",2003-05-09
"  Muslim  leader  attacks   PM  over  Iraq,  Israel   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   AUSTRALIAN  Muslim  leader  Dr  Ameer  Ali  has  attacked  Prime  Minis   ter  John  Howard  for  becoming  involved  in  the  Iraq  war  and  not  in  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict.   The  criticism  was  voiced  at  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  (AFIC)  annual  dinner  in  Sydney  at  the  weekend  at  which  Howard  was  guest  of  honour.   His  invitation  to  the  dinner   angered  some  Muslim  groups  and  led  to  calls  for  a  boycott.   Addressing  the  dinner,  AFIC  pres   ident  Dr  Ameer  Ali  condemned  the   military  action  against  Iraq  as  illegal  and  immoral,  and  called  for  the  gov   ernment  to  become  involved  in  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  instead.   Australian  mosques  had  been  fire  bombed,  women  have  been  harassed,  children  had  been  threatened  and  Muslim  leaders  had  received  death  threats,  he  said.   “It  is  difficult  to  understand  the  involvement  of  Australia  in  this  war.”   Taking  the  podium,  the  Prime  Minister  appealed  to  Islamic  leaders  to  work  with  the  government  to  pro  mote  unity  and  said  he  did  not  apol  ogise  for  supporting  the  Israeli   Government  or  the  Americans  at  war.   He  repeated  a  call  he  has  made   several  times  since  the  beginning  of  the  year  -  for  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  to  do  more  for  peace   with  the  Palestinians.   “Fundamental  to  peace  and  stabil  ity  is  a  resolution  to  the  Israeli-Pales   tinian  conflict  ”  he  said.   “Australia  has  been  and  remains  a  staunch  friend  of  Israel.  We  also  strongly  support  the  creation  of  a  viable  independent  Palestinian  state.   “Australia  has  been  and   remains  a  staunch   friend  of  Israel.  We  also   I  strongly  support  the   creation  of  a  viable  independent   Palestinian  state""   JOHN  HOWARD   Prime  Minister   “I  again  urge  Ariel  Sharon  to  use   the  mandate  of  his  re-election  to   respond  positively  to  all  opportuni  ties  to  achieve  a  peace  settlement.  I  ask  him  to  understand  why  the  Pales  tinians  view  the  expansion  of  Jewish  settlements  as  provocative.   “The  government  will  do  every  thing  in  its  power  to  encourage  the  Israelis  and  Palestinians  to  negotiate  a   resolution  to  this  conflict,  which  has  cost  too  many  innocent  lives  and  casts  a  shadow  across  the  entire  region.”   The  Prime  Minister  said  the  world’s  focus  on  the  Middle  East  brought  renewed  vigour  to  the  peace  effort.  “This  opportunity  must  not  be  squan  dered.  It  places  responsibilities  on  both   the  Israelis  and  the  Palestinians.   “We  urge  both  sides  to  embrace  the  proposed  road-map  to  peace,  which  has  been  developed  by  the  United  States  in  close  co-operation  with  Russia,  the  European  Union  and   the  United  Nations.”   The  decision  of  Chairman  Arafat   to  appoint  Mahmoud  Abbas  Prime  Minister  is  welcome.  “He  must,  how  ever,  be  allowed  negotiating  authority  if  his  appointment  is  to  become  any  thing  more  than  empty  symbolism.”   It  was  crucial  to  the  peace  process  that  the  murderous  suicide  bombings  against  Israel  cease,  Howard  said.   “The  world  is  concerned  about  terrorism.  The  use  of  terror  contra   dicts  the  basic  philosophies  of  Chris  tianity,  Judaism  and  Islam.   ""It  is  an  affront  to  Muslims  when  merchants  of  terror  invoke  the  name   of  their  religion  to  justify  their  per   verted  deeds.  We  in  Australia  will   never  accept  that  al-Qaeda  or  Jemaah  Islamiah  speak  or  act  on  behalf  of  the   Islamic  world.” ",2003-04-18
"  Muslim  fundamentalist   hero  of  anti-global  crowd   PHILIP  CARMEL   PARIS  —  An  Islamic  fundamentalist   accused  of  antisemitism  and  suspect  ed  of  links  with  al-Qaeda  is  the  new  star  of  Europe’s  anti-globalisation   movement.   Swiss  Muslim  theologian  Tariq  Ramadan  stole  the  show  at  last  week’s  European  Social  Forum  in  Paris,  a  three-day  event  that  attracted  more  than  50,000  anti-globalisation  activists  from  across  the  continent.   Ramadan,  who  teaches  Islam  at  the  universities  of  Geneva  and  Fri   bourg,  appeared  as  the  principal   attraction  at  two  events  and  was  the  only  participant  granted  a  personal   news  conference.   Ramadan’s  presence  at  the  forum  was  controversial  since  he  has  been   widely  criticised  for  penning  an  allegedly  antisemitic  text  attacking  French  Jewish  intellectuals.   Ramadan  wrote  last  month  that  a  list  of  French  intellectuals  “who  have  always  been  considered  as  universalist  thinkers”  are  “increasingly  affected  by  a  community-based  sectarianism  which  tends  to  relativise  the  defence   of  universal  principles  of  equality  and  justice”.   The  article  went  on  to  describe  how  the  “political  positioning”  of  “French  Jewish  intellectuals”  was  determined   by  their  personal  status  as  “Jews,  nationalists  and  defenders  of  Israel”.   This,  Ramadan  claimed,  had  caused  Andre  Glucksman,  Bernard  Henri  Levy  and  Alain  Finkielkraut  to  support  the  US-led  military  opera  tion  in  Iraq.  Levy  had  decided  to  write  his  recent  book  on  the  assassi  nation  of  American  Jewish  journalist  Daniel  Pearl  as  a  way  to  support  Israel’s  pro-India  policy  and  attack  a  Muslim  state,  Pakistan,  Ramadan  also  wrote.   In  fact,  Levy  also  wrote  a  number  of  articles  opposing  the  war.  Both  he  and  Finkielkraut  have  publicly  criti  cised  the  policies  of  Israel’s  current  government  and  have  endorsed  the  “Geneva  Accord”,  an  unofficial  peace  plan  drafted  by  Israeli  Opposition  fig   ures  and  Palestinians  close  to  the   Palestinian  Authority  leadership.   Moreover,  another  of  those  accused  by  Ramadan  as  placing  his  Jewish  ethnic  background  before  his  universalist  principles  -  the  author  of  The  New  Judeophobia,  Pierre-Andre  Taguieff  -  is  not  even  Jewish.   A  number  of  leading  French  news  papers  refused  to  print  Ramadan’s  article,  but  the  European  Social  Union  printed  it  on  its  website  and  strongly   resisted  demands  that  Ramadan  be  excluded  from  the  European  Social   Forum.

"  Jewish,  Muslim  photographers  have  common  brotherhood  in  focus   A  JEWISH  photographer  and   an  Iranian-born  Muslim   photographer  have  combined  their  talents  to  produce  an  exhibition  designed  to  convey   the  brotherhood  of  Man  and   the  commonality  of  people.   Brotherhood  of  the  Grapes:  Duet  #1  is  the  title  of  a  joint  photographic  exhibition  which  has  opened  at  the  Sherman  Galleries  by  Homi   Vesal  and  Paul  Green.   Working  in  a  spirit  of  close  co-operation,  Vesal  and  Green  have  ventured  into  the   complex  theme  of  religion  -  most  significantly,  their  own  religions  and  backgrounds;   Vesal  is  an  Iranian-born  Mus  lim  and  Green  the  Sydney  born  Jew.   “We  have  reduced  the  images  to  their  most  basic  elements,”  Green  said  -  “the  Jew  on  one  side,  the  Muslim  on  the  other.   Only  their  backs  and  the   backs  of  their  heads  can  be   seen  as  they  face  a  grey  void.   “They  are,  of  course,  the  same  person;  only  the  detail  in  the  embroidery  of  the  skull  cap  sets  them  apart.   With  this  very  simple  duet,  we  see  the  similarities,  the  differences,  and  try  to  expose  the  spirit  of  brother   hood  that  exists  between  all  humans”   This  is  the  second  large  scale  series  of  photographic   works  on  which  Green  and  Vesal  have  collaborated  since   jo  da  in  2001.  Jo  da,  which  means  “separated”  in  Farsi,   was  first  exhibited  at  “Free   space”  in  Sydney  and  then  at  the  Manly  Regional  Art  Gallery.   It  was  also  exhinited  in  a   group  exhibition  called  fall   out  at  the  VCA  in  Melbourne.   Brotherhood  of  the  Grapes:  Duet   #1,  Sherman  Galleries,   Paddington.

"  Don’t  invite  Howard,   Muslim  groups  protest   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   PRIME  Minister  John  Howard  has  been  told  that  some  Muslim  groups  do  not  want  him  as  guest  of  honour  at  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Council’s  (AFIC)  annual  congress  dinner  this  month  because  the  gov  ernment  “joined  the  war  criminal  George  Bush  in  an  illegal  war  against  innocent  Muslim  people”.   The  Prime  Minister’s  Office  con   firmed  a  report  in  The  Australian  that  Howard  has  accepted  an  invitation  to  attend  the  dinner  of  the  Muslim  com  munity’s  peak  body,  but  could  not  say  what  his  reaction  would  be  to  the  protests  of  Muslim  groups.   The  office  confirmed  that  Islamic  Egyptian  Society  secretary  Mohammed  Helal  has  sent  Howard  a  copy  of  a  letter  he  wrote  to  AFIC,  say  ing  “the  vast  majority  of  the  Muslim  community  demands  that  you  with  draw  your  invitation  and  refuse  to   accept  any  representatives  from  the  Howard  government  that  joined  the  war  criminal  George  Bush  in  an  illegal  war  against  innocent  Muslim  people”.   The  report  quoted  Helal  as  saying:   “Now  that  he  has  made  the  decision  to   send  troops,  it  is  not  right  to  have  him  as  a  guest  of  honour.  He  sent  our  Aus   tralian  soldiers  to  kill  innocent  Mus  lim  brothers  and  sisters.”   Lebanese  Muslim  Association   spokesman  Keysar  Trad  is  quoted  as  saying:  “Our  religion  is  about  peace.  How  can  we  support  someone  who  is  being  belligerent?”   AFIC  chief  executive  officer  Amjad  Ali  Mehboob  said  it  was  important  to  start  dialogue  with  the  Prime  Minister  and  most  Muslims  wanted  to  engage  in  open,  democratic  debate  with  him.

"  A  witch,  two  atheists,  a  Muslim  and  a  Catholic  -  Judaism  101   CONTINUED  FROM  LIFE  1   Third  year  Arts/lnfomatics  stu  dent  Melissa  Markauskas,  19,  want  ed  a  Jewish  perspective  on  Mediaeval  history  in  contradistinc  tion  to  the  majority  Christian  and   Muslim  views.   ""I'm  not  Jewish,  why  do  I  have  to  be  Jewish  to  do  Jewish  Studies?""  she  asked.   ""I  don't  have  a  religion  at  all.  I  find  it  interesting  because  I'm  outside  of  the  conflict  between  religions  and  have  no  concept  of  it.  To  me  Jerusalem  is  a  bit  of  land  like  any  other.""   From  a  Catholic  background,  Markauskas  has  never  attended  a  church  service  and  calls  herself  an  atheist.   ""My  grandparents  came  out  of  Lithuania  via  the  Nazis  and  my  grandmother  thinks  the  Germans  were  wonderful  people  and  refuses  to  believe  that  the  Holocaust  ever  happened.  It's  part  of  my  family  that  I'm  divorced  from.  It's  her  belief  and  I  think  she's  nutty,  but  I  don't  have  to  deal  with  it  on  a  reg  ular  basis.""   Trying  to  understand  the  political  situation  in  the  Middle  East  was  another  motivating  factor  for  stu  dents  studying  Jewish  topics.   ""Coming  from  a  Palestinian  Muslim  background,  I  knew  Palestinian  history,  but  I  hadn't  heard  the  Jewish  side  and  why  there  seems  to  be  an  inherent  animosity  between  Jews  and  Muslims,""  second  year  arts  student  Feda  Abdo,  18,  said.   ""If  things  are  going  to  change  we  have  to  learn  about  each  other's  faiths.  The  similarities  between  Judaism  and  Islam  far  outweigh  the  differences.

Fourth  year  arts/law  student  Neal  Funnell,  25,  concurred:   ""I'm  conflicted  between  the  ter  rible  history  of  the  persecution  of  Jewish  people  juxtaposed  with  what  I  believe  is  the  unfair  treatment  and  persecution  of  the  Palestinian  peo  ple.   ""My  views  on  Israel  and  Palestine  are  a  lot  more  balanced  than  they  were,""  added  Funnell  who  attends  Dr  Geoffrey  Brahm  Levey's  ""Jews  in  Modern  Society""  course  at  UNSW.   “The  similarities  between  Judaism  and  Islam  far  outweigh  the   differences.

""From  primary  school  onwards,  I've  been  given  the  idea  that  Jewish  people  keep  to  themselves,  and  all  Jewish  people  know  how  to  do  is  make  money.

Added  Dr  Rutland:  ""It's  not  so  surprising  that  there  are  more  non  Jewish  students  because  most  of  the  Jewish  students  go  to  New  South  Wales  University.

"  Can  wine  be  holy?   ASK  THE  RABBI   RABBI  RITCHIE  MOSS   At  a  Jewish  home  on  a  Friday   night  a  Muslim  was  surprised  by  Kiddush  over  wine.  Does  Judaism  consider  sensual  indulgence  holy?   EACH  of  us  has  a  body  and  a   soul  Our  body  is  usually  only  interested  in  the  material  pleas  ures  that  this  world  has  to  offer  -  a  good  meal,  an  entertaining  TV  show,  comfort  and  gratification.   The  soul  has  higher  aspirations  -  it  seeks  true  love,  meaning,  inspira  tion  and  a  connection  to  what’s  holy.   All  religions  attempt  to  give  us  access  to  our  souls.  But  as  long  as  the  body  continues  to  chase  the  mun  dane,  the  soul  is  trapped.  There  are   two  methods  to  free  the  soul  offered   by  different  religions:   •  Suppression:  by  suppressing  our  bodily  desires  we  can  allow  the  soul  to  shine  through.  This  means  a  life  of  ascetism  and  abstinence,  avoiding  the  pleasures  of  this  world.   •  Refinement:  alternatively,  we  can  find  spirituality  within  the  mun  dane  itself,  by  being  involved  with  the  physical  world  in  a  holy  and  refined  way.  Then  the  body  no  longer  oppos  es  the  soul;  on  the  contrary,  it  serves   as  a  vehicle  to  express  the  soul’s   needs.   Judaism  insists  on  the  second  approach.  Rather  than  suppress  the  body,  refine  it  Don’t  be  celibate,  but  save  sexuality  for  marriage.  Don’t  fast  all  day,  but  only  eat  foods  that  are  spiritually  pure.  Work  with  the  body,  not  against  it   The  path  of  refinement  is  a  chal  lenging  one,  but  it  is  possible.  Just   look  at  wine.   Wine  has  a  unique  property  that  demonstrates  that  we  need  not  afflict   our  bodies  to  tap  in  to  our  souls.  Wine  improves  with  age.   All  foods  decompose  over  time.  So  do  all  physical  things  -  buildings  crumble,  clothes  wear  out,  bodies  age.  This  is  because  anything  physical  is  ephemeral  -  it  doesn’t  last,  while  the  world  of  the  spirit  is  eternal,  and  gets  stronger  with  time.  The  one  exception  is  wine.   Wine,  although  it  is  also  physical,  has  the  spiritual  property  of  improv  ing  with  age.  It  is  wine  that  testifies  that  even  the  physical  can  be  refined.   Wine  represents  what  Judaism  is  all  about:  the  fusing  of  the  holy  and  the  mundane,  the  spiritual  and  phys  ical,  the  body  and  soul  What  could  be  more  holy  than  that?

"  Hands-on  experience   ?  SHAE  JOHNSON  WT   Working  during  the  Iraqi  war  in  neigh-  bouring  Muslim  country  Jordan,  Trevallyn  resident  Don  Atkinson  wit  nessed  first-hand  the  import  ance  of  his  work  as  a  water   sanitation  delegate  tor  the  Australian  Red  Cross.  During  his  two  months  in  Jordan,  the  Meander  Valley  environmental  health  officer  was  the  sole  Australian  in  a  camp  of  35  international  delegates,  10  Jordanian  nationals  and  more  than  150  Jordanian  Red  Crescent  volunteers  in  the  Amman  Regional  Delegation  for  the  Inter  national  Federation  of  Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent.  Mr  Atkinson  volunteered  dur  ing  his  annual  leave  from  the  council.  His  experience  was  put  to  the  test  during  the  Mozambique  floods  and  at  the  Lugufu  Refugee  Camp  inhabited  by  some  60,000  Congolese  refugees.  He  said  it  was  the  excitement  and  adrenaline  of  combining  work,  travel  and  new  cultures  with  doing  ""something  valuable""  that  drew  him  to  the  work.  ""In  other  trips  I  have  been  on  it  has  been  very  exciting  and  I  have  grown  to  like  the  excitement,""  he  said.  ""Here  I  was  looking  at  a  history-making  event  and  guaran  teed  pretty  good  levels  of  excite  ment  and  adrenaline.  It  was  too  good  an  opportunity  to  pass  up.  ""For  me  it  was  fantastic,  it  always  is.  ""It's  a  change  to  what  we  do  have  in  Australia.  ""And  at  the  end  of  the  day  you  feel  like  you  have  done  something  valuable,  really  helped  people.""   Working  in  Jordan  and  Syria,  Mr  Atkinson  helped  set  up  water  supplies  and  sanitation  systems  for  potential  refugee  camps  which  ended  up  supporting  several  hun  dred  people  during  the  war  on  Iraq.  ""From  our  point  of  view  once  the  war  started  there  was  a  mild  panic  and  while  the  coalition  forces  gave  us  plenty  of  warning  it   still  didn't  alter  the  fact  if  you  have  a  war  in  the  adjoining  country  there  was  likely  to  be  hundreds  of  thousands  fleeing  the  war  zone  and  coming  to  your  locality,""  he  said.  ""And  it  was  a  rustic  camp  in  the  Middle  Eastern  desert.  ""These  people  were  in  a  fairly  emotionally  poor  state  of  mind  and  physically  in  a  deteriorating   condition  and  going  through  it  in  the  middle  of  a  war  in  which  they  might  have  left  family  and  friends,  businesses,  livelihood,  and  their  house  —  which  could  be  bombed  or  looted.  ""There  is  a  learning  experience  having  to  deal  with  events  of  people  being  affected  by  certain  conditions.""  He  said  there  was  difficulty   finding  ""reasonably  good  water""  some  400  metres  underground  and  then  trying  to  access  it,  treat  it  and  make  sure  it  was  clean  enough  for  people  whose  condition  could  be  fairly  compromised.

"  Incorrect   EVE  Faine  considers  local  Jews  are  little  concerned  about  anti  Muslim  racism  here  (AJN,  17/01/03).

"  BUSH'S  REASONS   COULD  a  reason  for  the  war  on  Iraq  be  that  Bush  wants  another  funda  mentalist  Muslim  government  in   the  Middle  East?   Bush  has  worked  very  hard  to  break  down  the  separation  of   Church  and  State  in  the  US.   Originally,  the  “war  against  ter  ror”  was  against  Al-Qaeda.  Now  it  has  shifted  to  Iraq.   Saudi  Arabia  and  Iran  are  reli   gious  states.  Saudi  Arabia  is  domi  nated  by  the  Sunni  Wahhabi  sect  that  apparently  inspired  the  destruc   tion  of  the  World  Trade  Centre.  Iran   is  dominated  by  the  Shi’ite  Ayatol   lahs.   Bush  is  dominated  by  the  puri  tanical  Christian  Methodist  sect.   Iraq  is  secular  compared  to  most  Arab  states.

"  HOWARD  DEFENDS  ISRAEL   PRIME  Minister  John  Howard  defended  Israel  on  talk-back  radio  last  week  when  a  caller  who  identified  himself  as  an  Australian  Muslim  charged  Israel  with  defying  the  United  Nations  for  35  years  and  occupying  Palestine  and  “part  of  Syria  and  Lebanon”.   Howard  told  the  caller  on  Neil  Mitchell's  Radio  3AW  program  that  his  allegation  was  untrue  and  that  neigh  bouring  countries  had  tried  to  destroy  Israel  from  the  time  it  was  created  and  had  denied  its  right  to  exist  for  decades.  “Israel  is  the  only  genuine  democracy  in  the  Middle  East,  the  only  truly  functioning  democracy,”  he   said.

Which  is  precisely  what  a  Sydney  Muslim,  Christian  and  Jew  are  attempting  to  do  under  the  banner  of  the  Goodness  and  Kindness  program,  run  by  North  Shore  Chabad  House.   Rabbi  Zalman  Kastel,  Australia  Fair  (formerly  Australian  Muslim  News)  editor  Kuranda  Seyit  and  Catholic  theology  student  Joe  Sheri  dan  regularly  visit  schools  to  expose  students  to  representatives  of  all  three  faiths  and  the  need  for  tolerance.   The  program  has  been  augmented  by  similar  exchange  programs  in  Mel  bourne  run  by  Mount  Scopus  College  and  Bialik  College.   “We  don’t  feel  it’s  enough,”  Seyit  said,  “so  we  do  follow-ups  and  work   with  teachers.   “We  need  to  open  the  doors  for  dialogue.

About  100  schools  have  requested  a  visit.   “There  are  misconceptions  about  Jewish  people  that  I  don’t  think  about  because  I’m  too  worried  about  the   misconceptions  of  Islam,”  Seyit  said.   “Israel  is  the  most  divisive  issue  in  the  world.  It’s  not  just  a  Muslim-Jew  ish  thing;  a  lot  of  Christian  people   think  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  must  be  solved  to  go  forward.   It  undermines  the  progress  between  Muslims  and  Jews.  Its  the  most  challenging  issue  we  need  to  talk  about.  Here  in  Australia  we  need  to  show  how  we  can  get  along  as  human  beings;  we  can  show  the  politicians  that  Israelis,  Palestinians,  Muslims  and  Jews  can  get  along  very  well.”   One  of  three  initiators  of  the  Women’s  Interfaith  Network  (WIN),  Aziza  Abdel-Halim  -  together  with  Ethnic  Communities  Council  deputy  chair  and  ECAJ  honorary  secretary  Josie  Lacey  -  expressed  dismay  that  people  still  have  not  worked  out  that  war  does  not  solve  problems.   “The  only  way  is  to  listen  from  a  position  of  mutual  respect  and  always  hope  to  solve  the  problem,”  she  said.  “Nothing  can  be  solved  except  by  dia  logue.   “They’re  people  I’ve   j  befriended.They're  not  |  extremists.

"  Australia’s  Jews  and  Muslims:   AVIVA  BARD   DESPITE  alarmist  predictions  of  an  impending  dash  of  dvilisations,  Aus  tralia’s  Jewish  and  Muslim  communi  ties  appear  to  be  at  the  international   forefront  of  cordial  relations.  We  are  cousins  after  all   Away  from  the  glare  of  publidty,  representatives  of  each  faith  have  been  meeting  and  sharing  confi  dences  -  even  if  Israel  remains  a  high  ly  sensitive  issue.   Yet  leaders  of  both  communities   are  likeminded  that  open  channels  of  communication  are  vital  to  breaking  down  misconceptions  and  stereo  types  about  each  other’s  community.   Partidpating  in  the  international  Jewish-Muslim  dialogue  in  Kaza  khstan  earlier  this  year,  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  compared  the  progress   made  between  the  two  faiths  in  other  countries  with  that  in  Australia.   “The  contrast  between  what  we’ve  achieved  and  what  happens  in  most  countries  is  remarkable,”  he  said.   The  launch  of  the  Australian   National  Dialogue  of  Christians,  Muslims  and  Jews  by  Citizenship  and  Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  Gary  Hardgrave  in  March  marked  the  for  malisation  of  20  years  of  contact   Jewish  representatives  included  Jones,  the  Great  Synagogue’s  Rabbi   Jewish  interfaith  activist  Josle  Lacey  with  Women’s  Inteifafth  Network  member  Jamlla  Hussain.   Raymond  Apple,  Temple  Emanuel’s  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Kamins,  community  identity  Peta  Jones  Pellach  and  youth  delegates  Melanie  Schwartz  and  Yair   Miller.   “Because  of  the  nature  of  the   meetings,  we  don’t  discuss  publicly  what  happens  at  the  dialogue,”  said  Jones,  adding  that  issues  such  as  Jihad   and  Zionism  have  been  on  the  table.   “There  are  no  shrinking  violets.  People  are  happy  engaging  in  any  dis   cussion  about  issues  which  were  not   understood  by  the  general  public.”   Added  Schwartz:  “The  dialogues  are  important  for  people  to  respect  and  appreciate  each  other.  It’s  heart  ening  when  things  get  strained  from  the  outside,  that  you  have  people  talk  ing  to  each  other  and  lines  of  com  munication  are  still  open.”   As  for  the  presence  of  Islamic  fun  damentalist  supporters  in  the  country,  such  as  the  Islamic  Youth  Movement,  Jones  says  the  mainstream  Muslim  community  “is  as  concerned  by  these  groups  as  anybody  else  is”.   And  despite  the  setback  suffered  in  Islamic-Jewish  relations  following  Lakemba  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hilal/s  racist  speech  in  1988  -  in  which  he  described  Jews  as  “the  underlying  cause  of  all  wars  threatening  the  peace  and  security  of  the  whole  inhabited  earth”  -  for  which  he  has  never  apol  ogised,  relations  have  progressed.   Islamic  Council  of  Victoria  presi   Islamic  Council  of  Victoria  president  Yasser  Soliman...  addressed  a  JNF  Victoria  forum.   dent  Yasser  Soliman  recently  told  a  Jewish  National  Fund  forum  that  Hilaly  -  the  self-described  Mufti  of  Australia  -  “does  not  represent,  and  shouldn’t  be  seen  as  representing,  anybody  except  himself.  He  has  no  binding  say  on  the  Muslim  commu  nity  in  Australia.”   Jones:  “On  a  national  level,  Aus  tralia  has  the  best  formal  relations  between  Jews  and  Muslims  of  any  country.”   Yet  tension  clearly  exists  at  some  levels  -  and  outright  hostility  at  others.   When  Rabbi  Apple  and  NSW  Jew  ish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman  signed  a  joint  dec  laration  condemning  violence  with  Hilaly  last  year,  it  prompted  a  furious  behind-the-scenes  response  from  a  number  of  community  leaders,  claiming  that  the  overture  effectively  whitewashed  Hilaly.   Furthermore,  several  anti-Iraq  war  rallies  in  Sydney  this  year  were  marked  by  virulent  anti-Jewish  and  anti-Israel  remarks  by  Muslim  speak  ers  -  despite  the  fact  that  numerous  Jews  were  participating  in  the  rallies  and  that  the  focus  was  ostensibly  the  impending  war  (not  Israel).   Jones  has  taken  up  invitations  to  address  the  Muslim  community  at  the  30,000-strong  Fairfield  Eid  festival  and  at  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  launch  of  a  booklet  explaining  Islam.   While  lauding  the  necessity  to  com  municate,  Soliman  has  not  extended  an  invitation  to  his  Jewish  counterpart,  Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victo  ria  president  Michael  Iipshutz,  to  address  the  Muslim  community.   “We  haven’t  had  the  luxury  of  holding  such  functions,”  Soliman   Melanie  Schwartz...  has  participated  In  meetings  with  the  Islamic  and  Christian   communities.   said.  “We’ve  been  in  crisis  manage  ment  mode,  diverting  resources  to  deal  with  security,  media  and  author  ities.  We  have  the  offer  from  Jewish  leaders  making  themselves  available.  But  there  hasn’t  been  the  opportune  time  to  speak.”   But  he  was  adamant  about  the   need  for  dialogue  to  dispel  myths.   “There  is  a  fear  of  each  side,  that  the  other  is  trying  to  undermine  its  existence.  You’ve  got  to  build  confi  dence  with  each  other  against  a  tide  of  people  trying  to  undermine  that.   “We  need  to  open  the  doors  for  dialogue.

"  eeting  the  neighbours   A  MUSLIM,  a  Buddhist  a  Hindu  and  a  Jew  came  together  recently  to  dis  cuss  life  as  members  of  a  minority  faith  in  a  predominantly  Christian  society.   “Come  Meet  the  Neighbours”  was   the  theme  of  the  session  at  the  10th   Assembly  of  the  Uniting  Church  of  Australia,  attended  by  800  people.   Representing  the  Jewish  commu  nity  was  Peta  Jones  Pellach,  Director  of  Adult  Education  at  The  Shalom  Institute,  who  outlined  the  values  which  require  Jews  to  respond  to  those  in  need  and  to  stand  up  for  their  prin  ciples.   Referring  to  an  Indonesian  dele  gate  who  had  described  a  visit  to  Iraq  with  Muslim  women  as  creating  a  “human  shield”,  she  suggested  “another  perspective  on  the  so-called   ‘human  shield’.   “I  said  how  proud  I  was  of  my  daughter  who  has  made  aliyah  and  explained  that  she  did  not  want  to  sit  in  comfort  while  our  brothers  and  sisters  in  Israel  laced  the  threat  of  terrorism.   “But  by  making  her  life  in  Jerusalem,  she  is  not  a  ‘human  shield’.  ‘Human  shield’  implies  that  you  are  dealing  with  people  who  respect  life.  Her  risk  is  greater.   “Like  all  Israelis,  living  her  daily  life  is  heroic.  It  exemplifies  the  biblical  injunction  of  ‘not  standing  by  while  your  neighbour’s  blood  is  being  spilt’.   “The  next  day,  many  delegates  sought  me  out  to  say  they  were  pray  ing  for  my  daughter.  I  had  succeeded  in  making  them  see  Israel  a  little  dif  ferently,  if  only  for  a  while.”   However,  the  issue  that  raised  the   greatest  response  was  the  role  of  women.  Asked  if  women  in  Judaism  faced  similar  issues  to  those  faced  by  women  in  the  Church,  Jones  Pellach  said  she  spoke  about  the  discrimina  tion  against  women  which  stems  from  ignorance  or  sexist  attitudes  which  have  sources  outside  Judaism.   “I  told  them  about  Women’s  Tefillah  groups  in  the  Orthodox  world  and  said  I  was  proud  to  wear  the  tag  ‘Orthodox  feminist’.   “This  is  a  burning  issue  for  the  Uniting  Church  and  it  made  them  feel  good  to  know  that  Jewish  women,  too,  have  a  struggle.”   Jones  Pellach  urged  those  present  to  show  “zero  tolerance”  towards  antisemitic  comments  or  incidents.   The  evening  was  chaired  by  Wilma   Viswanathan  of  the  National  Council  of  Churches  of  Australia,  while  Unit  ing  Church  president  Reverend  Dr  Dean  Drayton  and  Reverend  Ray  Richmond  urged  delegates  to  deal  with  their  neighbours  with  love  and  respect   Peta  Jones  Pellach ",2003-08-29

"  ‘Ordinary  Islam’  wants  peace,  writes  Negus   MELISSA  SINGER   THE  “average  Muslim”  wants  peace  with  Israel,  denounces  the  actions  of  suicide  bombers  and  describes  the  United  States’  position  in  the  Middle  East  as  “hypocritical”.   This  is  the  view  of  seasoned  jour  nalist-turned-author  George  Negus,  who  traversed  the  Muslim  world  to  expose  “unapologetically”  the  myste  rious  -  and  profound  -  world  of  Islam  through  the  eyes  of  “ordinary”   Muslims  for  a  new  book.   The  result,  The  World  From  Islam,  includes  interviews  with  Islamic  diplomats,  Omani  princes  and  mem  bers  of  the  “99.9  per  cent  of  the  pop   ulation  who  aren’t  terrorists”.   Negus  claims  to  have  uncovered  some  of  the  more  profound  aspects  of  Islam,  intending  to  “throw  light  into  a  few  dark  corners”  which  exist  between  the  Muslim  and  Western  worlds.   He  says  he  found  most  of  the  Mus  lims  he  met  to  be  particularly  scathing  of  the  United  States  -  partic  ularly  over  Washington’s  controver  sial  stance  towards  its  “friend”,  Saudi   Arabia.   “The  contradiction  baffles  them  [Muslims],  then  it  angers  them  and  they  do  stupid  things.  The  Israelis  are  living  in  fear  and  the  Palestinians  are  feeling  they  have  no  hope.   “In  psychological  terms...  it  does   r   George  Negus  speaks  on  camera  outside  the  Damascus  Gate  in  the  Old  City  of  Jerusalem.   Photo:  Kirsty  Cockburn   n’t  make  what  they  [Palestinian  extremists]  do  right,  but  it  could  make  what  they  do  more  understand   able.”   While  Negus  acknowledges  the   anti-Israel  and  antisemitic  sentiments  espoused  by  some  of  those  he  inter  viewed,  he  insists  that  the  book  is  not  anti-Israel.  If  anything,  it  is  more  glar  ingly  anti-American  and  anti-Christ   ian,  he  maintains.   “I  find  it  staggering  that  world  leaders  such  as  Howard,  Blair  and  Bush  can  profess  Christianity  and  have  no  doubt  military  intervention  is  the  way  to  solve  a  problem  ”   After  the  success  of  his  first  book,  The  World  From  Italy:  Football,  Food  and  Politics,  Negus  was  considering  producing  a  television  series  when  he   was  approached  to  write  another  instalment  in  the  World  From  series.   Having  spent  30  years  as  a  journal  ist,  most  notably  on  Channel  9’s  60  Minutes  and  the  ABC’s  Foreign  Corre  spondent,  he  chose  Islam  —  not  to  find  solutions,  but  to  examine  “cause  and  effect”  in  the  context  of  the  Middle  East  conflict   “It  is  not  necessarily  about  what’s   right  and  wrong,  but  ...  the  huge  gulch  between  the  Muslim  and  non  Muslim  world.”   It  is  this  ignorance  which  has  given  rise  to  the  stereotypical  “Muslim  sui  cide  bomber”  and  left  the  world  media  with  a  lot  to  answer  for,  he  charges.   “It’s  a  stereotype  which  hangs  over  1.3  billion  people  because  of  the  homicidal  acts  of  less  than  one  per   cent.   “They  [the  media]  must  know  they  contribute  to  ignorance,  insecu  rity,  fear  and  paranoia  ...  but  the  threat  of  a  third  world  war  is  much  more  exciting  than  ...  a  headline  which  says  ‘Four  Palestinians  did  not  commit  suicide  today’.”   Closer  to  home,  Negus  feels  that  although  dialogue  between  Jewish  and  Muslim  communities  has  com  menced,  events  such  as  the  “deliber  ately  provocative”  awarding  of  the  Sydney  Peace  Prize  to  Dr  Hanan  Ashrawi  did  little  to  “acknowledge  the  double-edged  nature  of  the  relation  ship  [between  the]  mutually  igno   rant”  communities.   “We  have  a  great  opportunity  to  create  a  template  for  peace,  if  not  the  solution,”  he  says.   “Forget  who  cast  the  first  stone;  in  the  long  run,  it  doesn’t  really  matter.  And  let’s  not  feel  that  calling  ourselves  moderates  is  weak;  you  have  to  be  strong  to  compromise.” ",2003-11-28
"  Muslims  growing  eight  times  more  than  Jews   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   MORE  Australian  Jews  revealed  their  religion  in  the  last  national  Census  than  they  had  before,  but  Australia’s  Muslim  community  grew  eight  times  more  than  the  Jewish  community,  a  new  study  has   revealed.   Produced  by  the  Immigration,  Multicultural  and  Indigenous  Affairs  Department,  the  booklet,  The  People  of  Australia,  lists  the  number  of  people  describing  Judaism  as  their  religion  as  83,995  in  2001  -  a  5.3  per  cent  increase  from  79,805  in  1996.   (The  actual  Jewish  population  is  estimated  to  number  110,000  as  many  decline  to  answer  the  optional  religion  question  on  the  Census.)   By  comparison,  the  number  of  Muslims  grew  40.2  per  cent  between  1996  and  2001  -  from  200,885  to  281,578  -  a  leap  of  71.3  per  cent   The  other  two  fast-growing  com  munities  are  Buddhists,  who  increased  79.1  per  cent  between  1996  and  2001,  and  Hindus,  who  rose  41.9  per  cent  over  the  same  period.   Despite  the  increase  in  the  size  of  the  Jewish  community,  the  propor  tion  of  Jews  in  Australia’s  population   remains  at  a  mere  0.4  per  cent,  a  proportion  that  has  barely  changed  in  100  years,  according  to  figures   included  in  Professor  Bill  Rubin  stein’s  1995  study  Judaism  in  Aus   tralia.   The  Muslim  community  now  represents  1.5  per  cent  of  Australia’s  population.   Almost  half  the  Jews  who  revealed  their  religion  in  the  Census,  38,940,  were  bom  in  Australia.   The  next  single  biggest  group  in  the  Census  were  10,473  Jewish  South  Africans  out  of  a  total  of  36,029  people  recorded  in  the  Cen  sus  as  being  South  African-born.   Next  came  Jews  from  Israel  (3886),  England  (3885),  Poland  (3839)  Russian  Federation  (2930),  Ukraine  (2441),  Hungary  (1736),  US  (1592),  Germany  (1571)  and  12,692   from  other  unnamed  countries.   Among  the  languages  spoken  at  home,  there  were  5947  Hebrew  speakers,  almost  the  same  as  in  1996.  Yiddish  speakers  fell  from  2840  to   2666.   By  comparison,  there  are  209,376  Arabic  speakers  in  Australia,  87,276  of  them  Australian-born.   Another  64,698  came  from  Lebanon,  15,6712  from  Egypt,  10,824  from  Iraq,  1793  from  Gaza   and  the  West  Bank-  Others  were   from  Syria,  Sudan,  Jordan,  Kuwait,   Eritrea  and  a  number  of  unidenti  fied  countries.   A  total  of  102,566  Muslims  were  Australian-born  out  of281,576  pro  fessing  Islam  as  their  religion.   Lebanon  (29,321)  and  Turkey  (23,479)  were  the  two  biggest  over   seas  sources  of  Muslims.  The  rest   came  from  a  range  of  countries,  including  Afghanistan,  Bosnia  Herzegovina,  Pakistan,  Indonesia,  Iraq,  Bangladesh  and  Iran.   Buddhism,  the  fastest-growing  non-Christian  religion  in  Australia,  increased  79.1  per  cent  between  1996  and  2001,  from  199,812  adher  ents  to  357,813,  representing  1.9  per  cent  of  the  population.   As  with  Islam,  the  largest  number  of  Buddhists,  93,135,  were  bom  in  Australia,  outnumbering  Viet  namese-bom  Buddhists  by  2788.  Others  came  from  a  range  of  coun  tries  including  China,  Malaysia,   Cambodia  and  Thailand.   Hindus  -  whose  numbers  in  Aus   tralia  come  closest  to  those  profess  ing  Judaism  -  increased  41.9  per  cent  from  67,279  in  1996  to  95,473  in  2001,  with  31,938  bom  in  India,  19,748  in  Fiji,  16,570  in  Australia  and  10,206  in  Sri  Lanka.

"  Roche  denies  bomb  charges   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   BRITISH-BORN  Muslim  convert  Jack  Roche,  49,  has  pleaded  not  guilty  to  two  counts  of  conspiring  with  others  in  Malaysia,  Pakistan  and  Afghanistan  to  blow  up  Israel’s  embassy  in  Canberra  and  consulate  in  Sydney.   For  security  reasons,  Roche  did  not  appear  personally  in  the  Perth  Magistrates’  Court  to  enter  his  plea,  but  was  seen  via  video  link  from  a  Perth  prison.  Lawyer  Clare  Deane-Johns  responded  on  his  behalf.   Roche  has  been  in  custody  since  last  November,  when  Australian  Federal  Police  and  ASIO  agents  arrested  him  at   his  Perth  home  after  a  series  of  raids  seeking  individuals  with  alleged  links  to  the  terrorist  group  Jemaah  Islamiah.   Police  allege  that  Roche  conspired  with  others  to  damage  diplomatic  property  by  fire  or  explosives  and  to  harm  diplomatic  staff  at  Israeli  missions  in  Australia  between  February  15  and  May  26,2000.   The  charges  carry  a  maximum  of  15  years’  prison  for  plotting  to  damage  property  and  25  years  for  conspiring  to  harm  diplomatic  staff.

"  OUR  FAULT   BILL  Rubinstein  (AJN  21/2/03)  pre  dicts,  with  some  alarm,  that  the  rapid  growth  of  the  Muslim  popula  tion  of  Australia  could  put  the  much  lower,  and  in  comparison,  stagnant  number  of  Jewish  Australians  in  some  jeopardy.   For  this  we  mostly  have  ourselves  to  blame.  All  other  religions  actively   seek  converts  to  their  faith  and  make  it  easy  to  join.  We  Jews  go  the  oppo  site  way.  We  actually  discourage  anyone  wishing  to  become  a  Jew  and  even  if  someone  persists,  we  make  it  as  hard  as  possible  for  them.   To  survive,  we  have  to  move  out  of  the  mentality  of  the  Middle  Ages.   A  good  start  would  be  to  encourage   and  make  it  easier  for  mixed-mar   riage  couples  to  become  full  Jews,  so  they  and  their  children  would  help  increase  our  numbers,  instead  of  them  being  lost.

"  MARCH  22,2003   We  will  not  tolerate  intolerance   Conflict  in  the  Middle  East  is  invariably  followed  by  expressions  of  hostility  towards  Australia's  Jewish  and  Muslim  communities.  Why  is  there  a  dearth  of  condemnation  of  the  attacks  on  the  Jewish  community?   It  has  been  my  understanding  that  violence,  particularly  vandalism  of  synagogues,  has  been  a  matter  that  the  Jewish  community  hasn’t  wanted  widely  reported  because  of  concern  it  would  lead  to  copycat  attacks.   That  reason,  the  fact  the  attacks  rarely  hit  the  newspapers,  means  there  aren’t  many  opportunities  for  leaders  to  state  a  position.   Years  ago,  when  I  was  an  employee  of  the  attorney-general,  we  met  with  the  Board  of  Deputies,  who  were  keen  not  to  publicise  the  fact  that  about  a  third  of  NSW  syn  agogues  were  vandalised  in  any  given  year.   Having  said  that,  when  a  clear  incident  of  racial  hatred  is  revealed,  I  would  condemn  that.   We  have  advocated  as  one  of  our   policies  that  a  crime  of  hate  will  carry  a  25  per  cent  increase  on  the   sentence.   If  you  have  a  rape  and  the  sen  tence  was  20  years,  if  it  can  be  proven  that  it  was  a  racially-moti  vated  crime,  under  a  Liberal  govern  ment  we  would  increase  that  sentence  to  25  years  to  send  a  mes  sage  that  violent  crimes  are  wrong,  but  racially-motivated  hate  crimes  on  top  of  violent  crimes  are  more   evil.   We  have  to  demonstrate  through  the  force  of  law  and  our  sentencing  system  that  we  would  treat  race  and   hate  crimes  with  a  stronger  approach.   In  the  aftermath  of  the  1991  Gulf  War,  six  synagogues  were  firebombed.  To  this  day  no  arrests  have  been  made.   I  spoke  recently  at  the  Zionist  Federation’s  annual  meeting  and  made  the  point  that  I  would  be  happy,  in  government,  to  have  negotiations  with  the  Jewish  com  munity  about  providing  greater  police  protection  to  synagogues  so  that  the  cost  doesn’t  have  to  be  borne  by  the  community.  I  would   extend  the  same  to  mosques.   I  am  a  Catholic.  I  would  be  alarmed  to  see  security  guards  out  side  my  church.  I  can’t  imagine  how  distressing  it  is  to  attend  synagogue  and  have  to  be  protected  by  a  guard.   I  would  like  to  talk  to  the  Jewish  community  about  providing  police  to  assist  in  that  role,  providing  patrols.   At  the  same  time  I  would  like  to  reach  a  day  when  synagogues  don  t  need  security  guards  at  all.   The  State  Government  has  passed  tough  anti-terror  laws.  Are  they  appro  priate  or  not  tough  enough?   We  propose  one  area  to  make  them  tougher.  We  proposed  an   amendment,  but  the  government   voted  against  it,  to  give  police  pow  ers  of  search  and  arrest  for  14  days,  not  just  leading  to  a  suspected  ter  rorist  incident,  but  after  a  terrorist  incident.   The  government  stated  14  days  before  and  two  days  after;  we  believe  it  should  be  14  before  and  14  after.  But  we  stood  with  the  government  strongly  on  tougher  anti-terrorism   laws.   Since  Tampa,  September  11  and  Bali,  and  with  the  complicity  of  talkback  radio,  political  correctness  has  become  a  dirty  word.  Would  you  comment  on  the  heightened  lack  of  tolerance?   There  is  truth  to  that.  When   there  is  a  flashpoint  in  international  events,  people  revert  to  racial  stereotypes  and  think  the  worst  of  others.  They  become  suspicious  and   fearful.   “Communities   representing  their  views  to  their  elected   members  of  parliament  is  a  legitimate  and   necessary  part  of  our  vibrant  democracy.”   JOHN  BROGDEN  Opposition  Leader   In  this  climate,  with  war  on  our  doorstep,  it  is  hard  to  see  how  that  will  dissipate  quickly,  but  post  the  Gulf  War  it  did  dissipate  fairly  quickly  and  we  had  a  period  of  many  years  where  there  was  strong  racial  harmony  in  Australia.   Having  said  that,  we  have  the  most  successful  multicultural  coun   try  in  the  world.  We  have  difficulties  from  time  to  time,  but  in  general  the  balance  of  our  multicultural  society  works,  and  works  particularly  suc  cessfully.   Do  you  have  a  position  on  war  on  Iraq?   I  support  John  Howard’s  posi  tion.  It’s  important  for  Australia  to  be  part  of  the  international  forces  bearing  pressure  on  Saddam   Hussein  to  disarm.   Professor  Bill  Rubinstein  says  that  in  30  years,  there  will  be  one  million  Muslims  in  Australia,  which  would  pose  a  threat  to  the  Jewish  community  in  terms  of  lobbying  and  government.   There  are  probably  more  than  a  million  Catholic  immigrants  in  recent  years;  I  don’t  think  there  has  been  a  push  for  Catholicism  as  a  result.  That  is  an  alarmist  view.   The  Australian  culture  must  be  the  primary  culture  in  Australia.  I  support  the  right  for  people  to  cele  brate  their  faith  and  express  their  cultural  identity,  but  it  must  be  in  an  Australian  framework.   At  the  heart  of  the  Australian   character  is  tolerance,  but  the  con  verse  should  also  be  strongly  stated  —  it  is  not  the  Australian  way  to  be   intolerant.   Sometimes  we  say  the  first  half  and  think  the  second;  we’ve  got  to  say  both.  We’ve  got  to  state  that  we  are  a  tolerant  country  and  we  will  not  tolerate  intolerance.  That  is  a   requirement  of  all  citizens,  regard  less  of  race,  religion  or  background.   The  phrase  “Jewish  lobby”  is  thrown  around  as  a  dirty  word.  Is  it?   No.  Communities  representing  their  views  to  their  elected  members   of  parliament  is  a  legitimate  and  necessary  part  of  our  vibrant  democracy.   Jews  in  Australia  have  every  right  to  demonstrate  attachment  to  Israel.  The  history  of  the  Jewish  state,  par  ticularly  being  forged  out  of  the  ashes  of  World  War  II,  is  etched  in  the  memory  of  Australian  Jews.   Any  community  lobbying  gov  ernment  or  opposition  is  essential.   For  Labor  to  criticise  the  Jewish  lobby  is  offensive  and  out  of  touch.   One  of  the  fascinating  features  of  the  Jewish  community  in  America  is  that  they  have  become  involved  in  politics.  There  are  many  Jewish  sen  ators  and  congressmen.   We  don’t  have  a  history  in  Australia  of  Jews  being  prominent  in  politics,  certainly  not  reflecting  their  relative  authority  and  position;  Syd  Einfeld,  Barry  Cohen  and  Dr   Derek  Freeman  come  to  mind.   I’ve  always  found  it  interesting  that  unlike  in  the  US,  where  they  play  a  strong  role  in  politics,  it  has   not  been  the  same  in  Australia.   I  pose  that  as  a  question.  I  would  love  to  have  your  readers  answer.  It  would  be  fascinating  to  see  why  that   is  the  case.   Land  Tax?   The  strong  policy  of  the  Liberal  Party  is  that  Land  Tax  should  be  abolished  on  family  homes.  It’s  abhorrent  and  immoral  to  tax  somebody  for  living  in  their  own   home.   In  terms  of  Land  Tax  for  investors,  the  valuation  system  has  been  corrupted  and  it  is  important  to  reopen  the  previous  inquiry  to  ensure  that  the  system  is  made  fair   er.   We  are  committed  to  a  review  of  all  state  taxes  to  try  and  drive  down  our  reliance,  particularly,  on  prop  erty  taxes.   Will  Liberal  preferences  go  to  One   Nation?

Crown  prosecutor  Martyn  Plummer  said  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  had  dropped  a  second,  lesser,  conspiracy  charge  involving  the  Israeli  Consulate  in  Sydney  (which  closed  last  year).   Those  with  whom  Roche  is   alleged  to  have  plotted  include  “Mukhtar”,  also  known  as  Khalid  Sheik  Mohammed,  Osama  bin  Laden’s  No  3  man,  and  believed  to  have  been  the  mastermind  behind  the  September  11  attack  on  the   United  States.  Mukhtar  was  arrest  ed  in  Pakistan  last  month.   Roche’s  other  alleged  co-con  spirators  were  named  as  Abu  Hafe,  a  Mauritanian  al-Qaeda  deputy,  also  known  as  Mahfouz  Ould  Walid,  and  “Saif  ’  -  Egyptian  Saif  al-Adel,  an  al-Qaeda  security  chief  who  has  been  on  the  FBI’s  most  wanted  list  and  is  also  reported  to  have  been  arrested  last  month.   The  crime  carries  a  penalty  of  15  years  for  plotting  to  damage  property  and  25  years  for  conspir  ing  to  harm  diplomatic  staff.   Judge  Valerie  French  remanded  Roche  to  appear  again  on  July  31,   when  a  trial  date  will  be  set.   Roche  has  been  in  custody  since  November,  when  police  and  ASIO  agents  arrested  him  at  his  Perth  home  after  a  series  of  dawn  raids  seeking  individuals  with  alleged  links  to  the  terrorist  group  Jemaah  Islamiah.

"  JUDGMENT  IMPAIRED   THAT  Malaysian  Alf  Garnett,  Mahathir  Mohammed,  is  at  it  again.  Blaming  the  ills  of  the  Muslim  world,  and  the  world  at  large,  on  “the  Jews”.   He  calls  on  Muslims  to  use  their   brains  instead  of  brawn  to  fight  Israel.  I  suppose  it  has  never  occurred  to  Mahathir  that  the  use  of  their  brains  might  lead  Muslims  to  make  peace  with  Israel,  rather  than  fight  it   Perhaps  that’s  because  Mahathir’s  own  cognitive  faculties  have  been  irretrievably  impaired  by  prejudice.

"  SCEPTICAL   IN  many  years  or  monitoring  the  local  Arabic/Muslim  press,  I  have  yet  to  read  a  letter  from  Jews  For  a  Just  Peace  acknowledging  that  Jews  have  rights  to  a  homeland  or  denouncing   Palestinian  atrocities  against  Israelis.   Until  I  do,  I  will  continue  to  con  sider  both  their  name  and  their  claim   of  evenhandedness  with  a  healthy  dose  of  scepticism.   GEOFFREY  ZYGIER   Malvern,  Vic ",2003-06-27
"  FROM  THE  EDITOR   valhadef^]ewishnews.netau   ONE  of  the  most  frequently-heard  criticisms  of  the  Muslim  community  is  that  its  leaders  are  rarely  heard  speaking  out  against  acts  of  terrorism.   Which  makes  the  condemnation  by  Seyfi  Seyit  of  last  week’s  Jerusalem  bombing  all  the  more  welcome.   Speaking  as  the  director  of  the  Forum  on  Australia’s  Islamic  Relations  and  “on  behalf  of  all   Australian  Muslims”,  Seyit  unequivo  cally  condemned  “these  brutal  acts  of  violence.  They  do  nothing  to  bring  a  solution  to  the  conflict,  but  make  life  for  Palestinians  and  Israelis  worse.”   Seyit’s  response  can  only  augment  relations  between  the  Australian  Jewish  and  Muslim  communities.   Having  said  that,  it  is  not  enough  for  the  Jewish  community  to  sit  back  and  expect  such  reactions  unilaterally.   Initiatives  such  as  that  taken  by  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel,  which  recently  invited  an  Islamic  academic  from  the  University  of  Sydney  to  address  it  to  hear  his  perspectives,  are  essential  if  condemnations  like  Seyifs  are  to  become  de  rigeur  and  not  the  exception  (page  3).   Together  with  North  Shore  Chabad  Rabbi  Zalman  Kastel,  Seyit  is  one  of  the  pioneers  of  the  synagogue’s  Goodness  and  Kindness  Campaign  —  a  harmony  program  which  they  take  to  schools  across  Sydney  to  foster  understanding  of  the  Jewish,  Muslim   and  Christian  faiths  (page  7).   To  describe  Rabbi  Shmuley  Boteach  as  a  colourful  identity  would   be  a  massive  understatement   The  author  of  Kosher  Sex  has  bought  into  the  saga  of  the  Yeshiva  -  where  he  was  once  a  student  clashing   with  Rabbi  Pinchus  Feldman  over  their  conflicting  approaches.   Notwithstanding  their  differences,  he  holds  the  Yeshiva  spiritual  dean  in  high  regard,  and  has  contributed  ah  article  from  the  US,  arguing  that  Rabbi  Feldman  “should  be  lauded  as  a  triumphant  Jewish  hero,  rather  than  a  tragic  Greek  figure”  (page  17).

"  Israel  blasted  as  anti-war  rally  hijacked   V1CALHADEFF   SYDNEY’S  massive  anti-war  rally  was  temporarily  hijacked  by  two  Muslim  speakers  who  lambasted  Israel  for  “war   crimes”  and  “massacres”  -  to  raucous  applause  from  sections  of  the  crowd.   “Israel  kills  and  massacres  Palestinian  women  and  children,”  Muslim  Women’s  Association   spokesperson  Genan  Dadoun  shrieked  into  the  microphone  to  the  sea  of  250,000  people  gathered  at  Hyde  Park  and  surrounds  on  Sunday.   “Where  is  justice?”  the  University  of  Technology  student  demanded,  to   further  acclaim.   About  500,000  people  marched  across  Australia  -  adding  to  the  10  million  who  protested  against  war  on  Iraq  in  600  cities  around  the  world.   While  none  of  the  other  speakers  at  the  Sydney  rally,  including  arch  critic  John  Pilger,  made  reference  to  Israel,   Dadoun  and  Australian  Arabic  Communities  Council  executive  direc  tor  Randa  Kattan  attacked  it  with   venom.   Katan  charged  that  Israel’s  “long  standing  war  crimes  against  the  Palestinian  people  continue  unabated”.   “Thousands  of  Palestinians  have  died,”  she  continued;  “3.6  million  Palestinians  face  food  shortages,  starva  tion  and  poverty.   “Where  is  the  United  Nations   resolution  calling  for  an  end  to  the  occupation?  Where  is  the  resolve   of  the  United  Nations  to   One  of  the  signs  at  the  anti-war  rally.   establish  a  Palestinian  state?”   While  the  United  Nations  Calls  on   Iraq  to  destroy  its  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  “why  is  there  no  pressure   on  Israel  to  disarm  when  the  world  knows  that  it  had  chemical,  nuclear  and  biological  weapons?  Why  are  there   double  standards?”   Declaring  that  she  was  speaking  in  the  name  of  Allah  and  “under  the  ban   ner  of  peace”  and  “against  terror”,   Dadoun  said  “while  the  world  is  dis   cussing  Iraq,  Israel  is  openly  oppressing   the  Palestinians”.   “Israel  has  violated  many  United  Nations  resolutions,”  she  claimed.   She  quoted  from  the  Koran  -  “To  kill  one  person  is  to  kill  all  humanity”  (akin  to  the  quotation  from  the  Talmud  -  “He  who  saves  one  life,  it  is  as  if  he  has  saved  the  entire  world”).   “If  we  want  to  reduce  the  amount  of   terror  in  the  world,  we  should  do  what  Noam  Chomsky  said  and  stop  partici  pating  in  terror,”  she  added.   While  most  of  the  banners  at  the   rally  expressed  opposition  to  war  against  Iraq,  posters  under  the  name   Socialist  Worker  declared  “Don’t  attack  Iraq.  Smash  imperialism.  Free  Palestine”,  while  other  banners  stated  “Ariel  Sharon  to  face  war  crimes  court”,  “Israel  is  in  violation  of  over  60  UN  res   olutions  and  is  developing  WMD”  and  “Israel  has  loads  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  occupies  Palestinian  land  for  years,  ignores  all  UN  resolutions.   Act  now.”   Approached  for  a  comment  by  the  Australian  Jewish  News  following  his  speech,  Pilger  -  who  was  responding  to  questions  from  other  media  at  the  time  -  said:  “I  have  nothing  to  say  to  the  Australian  Jewish  News.”   Some  of  the  250,000  anti-war  protestors  at  Hyde  Park  on  Sunday.

"  INDONESIAN  EXAMPLE   IT  is  high  time  Israel  took  a  leaf  out  of  the  book  of  a  Muslim  nation.  Regard  ing  Aceh  province  in  Indonesia,  the  government  there  has  told  the  rebels  of  the  Free  Aceh  movement  “lay  down  your  arms,  give  up  your  aspira   tions  for  a  state  or  else  face  an  all-out  attack”.   This  could  and  should  be  the   response  to  the  latest  spate  of  atroci   ties  in  Israel.

"  WE  TOO  WANT  PEACE   I  REGARD  as  insulting  the  state  ment  by  Dr  Bill  Rubenstein  “The  rapid  growth  of  the  Muslim  popula  tion  poses  a  serious  threat  to  the  Jewish  community”  (AJN21/2/03).   While  there  is  a  growing  gulf   between  the  world  Muslim  commu   nity  and  the  government  of  Israel,   we  should  understand  that  the  divide  over  land  in  Palestine  is  not  an  eternal  divide  between  all  Mus  lims  and  Jews.   We  must  resist  ideologues  who  import  such  notions.  For  the  Jewish  community  to  be  incited  into  an   attitude  of  fear  over  the  size  of  the  Muslim  community  in  Australia  is  not  a  basis  for  harmonious  relations.   There  are  a  billion  Muslims  in  the  world.  To  see  us  as  the  bogeyman  is  destructive.  We  must  learn  to  live   together.  Please  consider  the  real  history  of  Muslim-Jewish  relations  and  not  some  nightmare  neo-con  scenario  designed  to  spread  that  fear  to  Australia.  Land  disputes  in   Palestine  since  1948  are  not  our   whole  history.   Let  readers  be  assured,  despite  the  efforts  of  extremists  in  both  our  communities,  that  the  Australian  Muslim  community  wants  to  live  peacefully  and  in  harmony  with  all   faith  communities  and  cultures.

"  FRIDAY,  JUNE  20,  2003  -  SIVAN  20,  5763   A  witch,  two  atheists,  a  Muslim  and  a  Catholic  from  the  universities  of   Sydney  and  New  South  Wales  spoke  to  AVIVA  BARD  on  why  they,  among  others,  are  helping  to  fill  the  esoteric,  philosophical,  historical  and  political  Jewish  Studies  lecture  theatres.   FASCINATION  with  Jewish  culture  is  perhaps  the  main  reason  why  the  majority  of  universi  ty  students  doing  Jewish  Studies  are  non   Jewish.   A  practising  witch,  fourth-year  honours  Mediaeval  studies  student  Sarah  Mathieson,  23,  has  a  Presbyterian  background  and  is  cur  rently  completing  second-year  Jewish  Civilisation  at  the  University  of  Sydney,  con  ducted  by  Dr  Suzanne  Rutland.  Two-thirds  of  the  class  are  not  Jewish.  ""Jews  are  an  impor  tant  part  of  the  Mediaeval  period  and  it's  helped  my  understanding  of  the  whole  Mediaeval  environment,  mood  and  culture,""  Mathieson  said.   ""I  was  brought  up  Christian.  My  grand  father  was  a  Presbyterian  minister,  but  when  I   hit  15  I  started  thinking  that  Christianity  was  n't  the  religion  for  me,  considering  all  the  hor  rible  things  they've  done  in  the  past.  So  I  went  for  a  nature-based  religion.   ""It's  better  than  calling  myself  a  pagan.  I  believe  in  a  big  divine  force  that  is  nice  and  worship  this  divine  force  through  the  cycles  of  nature  at  solstices  and  equinoxes.   ""I've  found  parallels  between  Judaism  and  my  own  beliefs.  We've  both  been  ancestrally  persecuted  and  I  love  the  Jewish  attitude  to  life.  It's  okay  to  feel  good  and  go  to  parties  and  have  fun  and  shouldn't  be  feeling  terrible  all  the  time,  which  is  something  that  I  think  Christianity  does  promote,  so  that's  what  I  find  in  tune  with  Judaism.""

"  ■  THE  AUSTRALIAN  ^  ^  ■  www.Ajn.toni  au   Jewish  News   Less  demonising,  more  talking   V   /■   %   IF  all  we  are  doing  is  demonising  each  other,  warns  Yasser  Soliman,  we   are  heading  in  the  wrong  direction.  Australia’s  Jewish  and  Muslim  com  munities  need  to  build  bridges  to  allay  their  mutual  fears,  he  says.  Not  only  is  Soliman  president  of  the  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria,  but  he  was  speaking  to  a  Jewish  audience,  the  Jewish  National  Fund.   “Many  people  in  the  Muslim  community  are  afraid  about  what  the  Jew  ish  community  has  got  planned  for  them,”  Soliman  continued;  “you  are  probably  very  frightened  about  what  you  think  we  have  got  planned  for  you.”   But  as  far  as  his  organisation  was  concerned,  “they  want  nothing  more  than  what  you  want  -  peace,  security  and  the  opportunity  to  raise  your   kids”.   In  a  letter  to  the  Australian  Jewish  News,  Muslim  human  rights  activist  Bilal  Cleland  wrote:  “For  the  Jewish  community  to  be  incited  into  an  atti  tude  of  fear  over  the  size  of  the  Muslim  community  in  Australia  is  not  a  basis  for  harmonious  relations.  There  are  a  billion  Muslims  in  the  world;  to  see  us  as  the  bogeyman  is  destructive.   “Let  readers  be  assured  -  despite  the  efforts  of  extremists  in  both  our  communities  -  that  the  Australian  Muslim  community  wants  to  live  peace  fully  and  in  harmony  with  all  faith  communities  and  cultures.”   The  sentiments  expressed  by  both  men  are  significant  and  welcome,  coming  at  a  time  when  members  of  the  Jewish  community  could  be  forgiv  en  for  feeling  somewhat  besieged  -  the  number  of  antisemitic  incidents  last  month  an  all-time  high  for  the  month  of  March;  anti-Jewish  banners  at  anti-war  rallies;  conspiracy  theories  about  Jewish  and/or  Israeli  interests  controlling  American  foreign  policy  and  driving  the  war  on  Iraq;  harsh  crit  icism  of  the  Jewish  community  and  Israel  from  Labor  MPs  in  Federal  Par  liament;  and  the  perennial  bad  press  that  Israel  receives.   It  is  no  secret  that  relations  between  the  Jewish  and  Muslim  communities   have  been  tense  in  recent  times,  exacerbated  by  anti-Jewish  and  anti  Israel  slogans  at  pro-refugee  and  anti-war  rallies;  the  unresolved  Israeli  Palestinian  issue;  and  the  iniquitous  anti-Jewish  utterings  of  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly,  the  Imam  of  Australia,  who  last  January  was  reported  as  legitimising  suicide  bombers.   In  this  regard,  it  was  encouraging  to  hear  Soliman  declare  that  Hilaly  “does  not  represent  -  and  shouldn’t  be  seen  as  representing  -  anybody   but  himself”.   In  the  meantime,  North  Shore  Chabad  Rabbi  Zalman  Kastel  has  initiated  the  Goodness  and  Kindness  Campaign  -  an  outstanding  initiative  in  which  he,  Muslim  leader  Seyfi  Seyit  and  Catholic  student  Joseph  Sheridan  engage  Christ  ian,  Jewish  and  Muslim  pupils  in  interactive  activities  designed  to  break  down  stereotypes  and  foster  mutual  understanding  and  acceptance.   Men  such  as  Yasser  Soliman,  Bilal  Cleland  and  Seyfi  Seyit  are  to  be  applauded  for  having  the  courage  to  speak  out  boldly  in  the  manner  in  which  they  have,  openly  espousing  the  need  “to  break  down  myths  that  have  gone  on  far  too  long”,  as  Seyit  told  pupils  at  Emanuel  SchooL   But  much  more  needs  to  be  done  -  on  both  sides.  More  Jewish  organi  sations  need  to  emulate  the  far-sighted  initiative  of  JNF  Victoria  and  invite  Muslim  speakers  to  address  them;  and,  as  Victorian  Jewish  leader  Michael  Lipshutz  tellingly  noted,  he  looks  forward  to  the  day  when  Jewish  leaders  are  regularly  invited  to  address  Muslim  organisations.   The  more  that  can  happen,  the  greater  the  likelihood  of  countering  demonisation  and  its  negative  fallout   Shirli  Kirschner,  a  conflict  resolution  expert,  recently  facilitated  a  work  shop  in  Israel  with  Israeli  Jews  and  Israeli  Arabs,  the  objective  being  to  cre  ate  a  forum  where  they  could  listen  to,  understand  and  validate  the  others’  issues  without  negating  their  own.

"  AVOIDING  CONFLICT   mb  letter  by  Geoffrey  Rothschild  (AJN  31/10/03)  rightly  suggests  that  one  should  not  dialogue  with  anyone   who  states  that  “Israel  is  the  most  divisive  issue  in  the  world”   He  attributes  that  remark  to  my  colleague,  Aziza  Abdel-Halim,  presi   dent  of  the  Muslim  Women’s  Net  work,  when  the  article  states  that  Kurunda  Seyit,  former  editor  of  the  Muslim  News,  is  the  relevant  person.  A  most  distressing  reading  of  the  article.   The  Women’s  Interfaith  Network  (WIN)  has  a  policy  of  refraining  from  discussion  of  political  issues  at  our  meetings.  That  is  one  of  the  rea  sons  why  our  group  is  so  successful.   We  have  women  from  nine  reli  gious  groups,  and  have  the  potential  for  almost  as  many  conflicts  if  we   ventured  into  such  discussions.

"  Hilaly  doesn’t  speak  for  us  -  Melbourne  Muslims   peter  mm   MELBOURNE  Muslims  do  not  regard  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly  -  the  Imam  of  the  Lakemba  mosque  who  has  made  virulendy  antisemitic  statements  -  as  an  authority  figure,  a  Victorian   Muslim  leader  said  last  week   “Some  people  say  he  is  the  Aus  tralian  Mufti...  but  he  does  not  speak   for  us.”   Abdul  Karim  Galea,  deputy  direc  tor  of  the  King  Khalid  Islamic  College  of  Victoria,  was  addressing  a  forum  on  Islam  run  by  Temple  Beth  Israel  in  a  bid  to  build  bridges  between  Mel  bourne’s  lewish  and  Islamic  commu  nities.   Galea,  whose  college  has  held  exchange  visits  with  Bialik  College  under  a  program  called  Harmony  Through  Understanding,  said  Mel   bourne’s  Muslims  are  not  that  focused  on  the  Middle  East  and  seem  more  concerned  about  the  “children  over  board”  affair  than  the  Israeli-Palestin  ian  conflict.   “You’d  be  shocked  at  how  little  world  issues  that  relate  to  the  Muslim   community  ever  come  up  for  discus  sion.  Issues  like  Palestine  or  the  Iraq   war  are  almost  never  discussed.”   A  convert  to  Islam,  Catholic-bom  Galea  said  the  upsurge  in  global  terror  ism  has  caused  a  lot  of  stereotyping  of  Muslims,  when  in  fact  there  is  no  monolithic  Muslim  position  on  world   events.   In  multicultural  Australia,  there  is  little  tolerance  among  Melbourne’s   Muslims  for  fundamentalist  Sharia  law,  he  said.   Conceding  that  one  of  the  under  standings  of  “jihad”  is  as  a  Koranic   right  to  the  defence  of  one’s  home  by  any  means,  Galea  said  the  Koran  placed  many  conditions  on  that   defence.   Sharing  the  platform,  Rafiq  Clark  son,  chairman  of  the  Islamic  Centre  of  Education  and  Development,  said  that  in  the  chaotic  hours  after  September  11,  there  were  perceptions  that  Aus   tralian  Muslims  were  not  fast  or  furi   ous  enough  in  their  condemnation  -  a  misconception  fuelled  by  the  media.   “Every  organisation  did  do  some  thing,  but  there  is  a  perception  that  maybe  they  didn’t  do  it  fast  enough.   “It’s  hard  to  know  what’s  an  appro  priate  time,  but  the  feeling  that  Mus  lims  did  not  jump  loudly  enough...is  a  misconception.  The  media  did  not  pick  up  that  ball  enough  to  put  on  the  front  page  those  organisations  that  did   condemn  it” ",2003-07-11
"  We  either  swim  or  sink  together*   Aviva  Bard   “WE  either  swim   together  or  sink  togeth  er,”  warned  Rabbi  Arthur  Schneier,  a  leading  American  fig   ure  in  interfaith  rela  tions.   In  Australia  on  a  pri  vate  visit  recently,  Rabbi  Schneier  is  founding  president  of  the  Appeal  of   Conscience   Foundation  and  rabbi  of  the  Orthodox  Park   Rabbi  Arthur  Schneier   Last  synagogue,  ne   met  heads  of  the  Jewish,  Muslim  and  Christian  communities  in  Sydney.   Established  in  1964,  the  Appeal  of  Conscience  Foundation  began  as  an  effort  to  free  Soviet  Jewry  and  evolved  into  promoting  human  rights  globally,  focusing  on  Eastern  Europe,  former  Soviet  Union  and  the  Balkans.   “Wherever  we  go,  we  reach  out  to  different  religious  leaders  to  strengthen  dialogue  and  tolerance,”  he  said.  “This  work  is  even  more  relevant  since  September  11  because  we  have  to  strengthen  those  who  believe  in  co-exis   tence.   “We’ve  been  involved  with  Muslim  religious  leadership  in  Kosovo,  Albania,  Central  Asia,  the  US  and  many  other  parts  of  the  world.   “Muslim  leaders  who  believe  in  tolerance  are  overwhelmed  by  the  radical  voices.  The  challenge  is  to  strengthen  those  in  the  Muslim   community  who  believe  in  co-existence.”   Recognised  for  his  contribution  to  human  rights,  Rabbi  Schneier  was  awarded  the  Presidential  Citizen’s  Medal  by  Bill  Clinton  and  was  appointed  by  the  first  President  George  Bush  as  Chairman  of  the  US  Commission  for  the  Preservation  of  America’s  Heritage  Abroad.   He  also  served  as  the  US  Alternate   Representative  to  the  43rd  UN  General  Assembly  under  the  Reagan  administration.   “For  a  Holocaust  survivor  who  spoke  a  bro  ken  English,  coming  to  the  States  and  having  made  a  contribution  to  perfect  an  imperfect  world  certainly  gives  a  sense  of  fulfilling  a  mitz  vah  for  having  survived,”  he  said.   Rabbi  Schneier,  who  was  born  in  Vienna  in  1930,  lived  in  Nazi-occupied  Budapest  during   the  war.   “The  most  gratifying  part  is  to  have  seen  the  exodus  of  one  million  Soviet  Jews  to  Israel  and  the  rekindling  of  Jewish  life  in  Russia.”   Rabbi  Schneier,  who  has  visited  Russia  65  times,  added:  “I  always  believed  not  only  in  ‘Let  My  people  Go’,  but  in  ‘Let  my  People  Live’.  We  not  only  focused  on  helping  those  who  wanted  to  leave,  but  also  on  keeping  the  flame  glowing.”   As  far  as  Israel  is  concerned,  he  warned  of  “appeasement”,  stressing  that  as  long  as  Yasser  Arafat  was  a  player,  there  could  not  be  peace.   “The  intifada  should  have  sounded  a  warn  ing  to  the  world  about  terrorism.   “One  should  not  make  a  distinction  between  an  attack  on  the  World  Trade  Centre  and  an  attack  in  Jerusalem  or  Bali.  It’s  no  longer  a  con  flict  between  states  —  just  a  question  of  what  terrorism  can  inflict.  There  has  to  be  the  resolve  not  to  appease,  but  to  stand  firm.”   About  9000  homes  will  be  contacted  by  volunteers  on  Sunday  as  part  of  Green  Sunday  —  a  jewisn  National  Fund  initiative  to  raise  funds  for  reforestation  programs  In  Israel.

"  MUSLIMS  WORRIED   YASSER  Soliman’s  comment  that  “Muslims  are  worried  about  what  the  Jews  have  in  store  for  them”  (AJN  4/4/04)  revealed  anti-Jewish  feeling  because  of  the  implied  belief  that  the  Jewish  community  has  either  power   or  desire  to  hurt  the  Muslim  commu   nity.  This  simply  has  no  basis.   Every  attack  on  Australian  Mus  lims  has  been  met  by  storms  of  con  demnation  from  our  rabbis,  communal  leaders  and  press.   I  wish  Muslim  spokespersons  would  return  the  compliment,  but  their  sporadic  condemnations  of  anti-Jewish  violence  are  couched  in  vague  terms  -  eg  “condemns  violence  against  innocent  people”  -  that  don’t  specifically  label  Jews  as  innocent.   We  have  not  demonstrated  against  Muslims,  not  even  with  peaceful  protests.  We  have  not  attacked  them  or  their  buildings.   We  have  not  circulated  petitions  calling  for  boycotts  or  sanctions  •against  their  countries  of  birth,  origin   or  association.  We  are  less  numerous,  less  vocal  and  less  likely  to  link  politics  with  ethnicity.   What  are  they  worried  about?  What  have  we  ever  done  to  give  them  reason  to  worry?  What  more  could   we  do  to  reassure  them?   JUDITH  RONA   Bondi,  NSW ",2003-04-18
"  KEY  INGREDIENTS   THE  recently-launched  Australian  National  Dialogue  of  Christians,  Mus  lims  and  Jews  offers  potential  for  greater  interfaith  harmony.  But  sever  al  ingredients  will  be  necessary  for  it  to   work.   All  parties  must  be  equally  willing  to  engage  in  self-criticism.  Minorities   I   [   shouldn’t  just  blame  the  majority  for  feelings  of  exclusion,  but  should  also  ask  whether  they  have  themselves  contributed  to  disharmony  through  certain  mindsets  and  behaviours.   There  must  also  be  a  right  mix  between  sensitivity  and  honesty.  For  example,  dialogue  activities  will  need  to  recognise  that  not  all  Muslims  are   mini-Bin  Ladens.   At  the  same  time,  Muslim  partici  pants  will  need  to  ask  what  it  is  about  Islam  that  fuels  the  recurring  Bin  Laden  phenomenon.   Here  in  Britain,  interfaith  dialogue  activities  frequendy  hit  upon  the  issue  of  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict.   In  the  new  Australian  forum,  Christian  and  Muslim  participants  must  shun  the  temptation  to  beat  the  anti-Israel  drum  as  a  mark  of  solidar  ity.   Middle  East  issues  should  be  dis  cussed  honesdy,  but  the  Arab  contri  bution  to  tensions  should  be  subjected  to  the  same  level  of  scrutiny  as  will  inevitably  be  applied  to  Israeli  policies.

"  AROUND  THE  SHULS   Canberra’s   interfaith  picnic   AVIVA  BARD  abard@jewishnews.net.au   PICNIC  rugs  and  tables  dotted  the  grounds  of  the  ACT  Jewish  Centre  at  an  interfaith  picnic  attended  by  local  Christian,  Jewish  and  Muslim  families  recently.   The  picnic  was  the  latest  in  a  series  of  inter-communal  events  between  the  three  faiths  that  have  taken  place  since  September  11,  2001,  and  attracted  more  than  70  people.   It  follows  a  visit  by  members  of  the  ACT  Christian-Jewish  Dialogue  Group  to  the  Canberra  Islamic   Centre.   The  decision  to  hold  an  inter  faith  picnic  arose  after  the  members  participated  in  a  ""Working  Together  for  Peace""  workshop  in  February.   Governor-General  Peter  Hollingworth  has  previously  addressed  the  three  groups  at  the   Australian  Centre  for  Christianity  and  Culture,  and  at  a  forum  on  Just  Peace  at  the  National  Jewish   Memorial  Centre  last  year.

"  Kazak  stops  funding  Hamas  ‘charity’   BERNARD  FREEDiViAN   PALESTESHAN  Authority  representa  tive  Ali  Kazak  has  stopped  contribut  ing  to  Human  Appeal  International,  the  most  prominent  Islamic  charity  in  Australia,  because  he  is  suspicious  about  where  the  money  is  going.   He  said  this  on  ABC  TV’s  Lateline   which  quoted  the  FBI  and  CIA  saying  Human  Appeal  International  “proba  bly  acts  as  a  fundraiser  for  Hamas”.   Kazak  said  he  would  not  be  sur   prised  if  money  was  going  from  Aus   tralia  to  Hamas  because  Hamas   operated  charity  organisations  in  Palestine  supporting  orphanages,  sick  people,  clinics  and  schools.   All  Kazak   He  said  he  had  stopped  contribut  ing  to  Human  Appeal  International   after  he  had  written  to  them  twice  ask   ing  how  the  Australian  money  was  spent,  but  had  received  no  reply.   Human  Appeal  International’s  regional  director  Bashar  al-Jamar  accused  Kazak  of  using  his  official  position  to  pursue  a  personal  vendetta  to  try  to  discredit  the  organisation  among  Australian  Muslim  leaders.   He  insisted  that  Human  Appeal  International,  which  is  not  a  member  of  the  Australian  Council  for  Overseas  Aid,  had  no  links  to  Hamas.   But  reporter  Jonathon  Harley  told  Lateline  that  in  August  last  year,  the  Islamic  youth  chat  group  Muslim  Net   Melbourne  featured  an  advertisement  for  a  Palestinian  fundraising  scheme,  the  101  Days  Campaign,  an  organisa  tion  which  counter-terrorism  experts  said  was  closely  linked  to  Hamas.   Attorney-General  Daryl  Williams’  office  said  groups  mentioned  by  Late  line  had  some  legitimate  social  and  charitable  activities.  The  challenge  was  “to  identify  that  component  of  fund  ing  which  might  be  directed  to  terror   ism  activities”. ",2003-10-03
"  ONE  SILLY  SPEECH   CAN’T  the  Jewish  News  and  Masada  College  just  chill?   As  war  is  raging  in  Iraq  and  the  powers  that  be  are  deciding  how  the  road-map  is  to  carve  up  Israel,  isn’t  it  slightly  “outrageous  and  deplorable”  (to  use  your  terms)  that  the  AJN  and  Masada  should  create  a  tempest  in  a  teapot  because  of  one  silly  speech?   As  for  Esther  Jungreis’  alleged  points  -  that  “rejecting  Shabbat  was  tantamount  to  rejecting  God;  Ishmael   and  the  Muslims  are  the  enemies  of   the  Jewish  people;  and  Jews  are  judged  by  different  standards  to  non  Jews”  -  here  is  an  attempt  to  clarify:   1.  Shabbat  is  one  of  the  Ten  Com  mandments  and  a  tenet  of  Judaism.  If  you  believe  that  Torah  is  Divine,  then  to  reject  one  of  its  tenets  would  be  to  reject  the  Divine.   2.  Not  all  Muslims  are  the  enemies   of  the  Jewish  people,  but  the  majority  of  antisemitism  is  emanating  from   Muslim  countries,  and  countries  with  large  Muslim  populations  (like  France).  And  radical  Islam  is  a  threat.   3.  Jews  have  613  mitzvot,  non-Jews  have  seven.  Obviously,  Jews  have  more  obligations,  and  therefore,  have  their  actions  judged  by  a  different  standard.   The  charge  that  Jungreis  “repeat  edly  invoked  the  Holocaust  as  her  ref  erence  point,  as  if  it  were  the  defining  moment  in  Jewish  history”  is  ridicu   lous.   If  she  said  it  was  the  defining  moment,  you  might  have  a  point,  but  she  didn’t.  She  merely  spoke  about  the  Holocaust,  as  survivors  do.   What  would  really  be  deplorable  is  if  Jungreis  gave  a  speech  saying  Jews  are  no  different  to  anyone  else,  there  is  no  threat  from  radical  Islam,  the  Holocaust  was  so  unimportant  it  should  be  forgotten  and  Jews  have  no  obligation  to  do  anything.

"  Reconsider  ban,  rabbi   urges  French  Government   FRANCE’S  Chief  Rabbi,  Joseph  Sitruk,  has  called  on  the  French  Gov  ernment  to  reconsider  a  proposed  ban  on  displays  of  conspicuous  reli  gious  symbols  such  as  kippot  and  Muslim  headscarves  in  public  work  places  and  schools.   His  comments  were  in  response  to  a  government-commissioned  report  suggesting  the  proposed  ban  as  the  best  method  of  preserving  the  coun  try’s  secular  ideals.   The  report  called  for  “the  strict  neutrality  of  all  public  service  employees”,  but  recommended  employees  wanting  to  take  days  off  for  significant  religious  festivals   should  be  accommodated  and   schools  should  close  on  Yom  Kippur  and  the  Muslim  holy  day  of  Eid.  Bizarrely,  though,  necklaces  with  the  Star  of  David  would  be  permitted.   Interviewed  by  Le  Figaro,  Rabbi   Sitruk  said:  “What  an  aberration  it  is   to  muzzle  religion  in  the  name  of  sec  ularism”,  advising  French  people  of  all   faiths  to  show  tolerance  towards  one  another,  rather  than  issue  bans.   “The  right  way  is  not  to  pass  a  law,  which  I  fear  would  end  up  banning  all  religious  symbols,”  Rabbi  Sitruk  said,  adding  that  the  century-old  separa   tion  of  Church  and  State  had  worked  well  and  should  not  be  altered.   He  said  it  was  important  to  differ  entiate  between  wearing  a  kippa  or  a  headscarf  and  wanting  to  overthrow   France’s  secular  institutions.   Describing  France’s  600,000  Jews  as  loyal  citizens,  Rabbi  Sitruk  has  advised  Jewish  youth  to  wear  baseball  caps  to  avoid  antisemitic  attacks.   But  French  President  Jacques  Chirac,  who  has  yet  to  indicate  his  thinking  on  the  issue,  said:  “I  will  be  guided  by  respect  for  republican  prin  ciples,  the  demands  of  national  unity  and  the  rallying  of  the  French  people.”   Bernard  Stasi,  who  headed  the  committee,  said  the  recommenda  tions  were  aimed  at  “forces  trying  to  destabilise  the  republic”.

Those  attacks  were  followed  five  days  later  by  suicide  bombings  on  the  British  Consulate  in  Istanbul  and  a  London-based  bank.   A  total  of  61  people,  including  the  four  bombers,  were  killed  in  the  attacks,  in  which  al-Qaeda  involvement  is  sus  pected.  Six  of  the  victims  were  Jewish.   “The  fact  that  we  opened  this  syna  gogue  in  such  a  short  period  shows  that  they  [the  terrorists]  did  not  achieve  what  they  wanted.  We  are  continuing  our  lives  here.  This  is  a  symbol  of  that,”  Ovadya  said.  ""Our  lives  must  go  on.”   Turkey’s  Jewish  community  of  around  25,000  people  is  the  largest  in  any  Mus  lim  country  and  is  based  mainly  in  Istan  bul.   Ovadya  said  some  200  members  of  the  Jewish  community  packed  into  Beth  Israel  on  Saturday  morning  and  said  prayers  for  the  victims  of  the  attack.   JERUSALEM  POST ",2003-12-19
"  Arts&amp;Books   Documentary  film  festival  tackles  real  issues   PREVIEW   QUEERDOCFILMFESTIVAL   Chauvel  Cinema,  Paddington  September  4-7   THE  ranges  of  Jewish  experience  are  wide,  and  each  year  Sydney’s  Gay  and  Lesbian  Film  Festival  -  which  coin  cides  with  the  Mardi  Gras  in  February  —  consistently  underlines  the  point.   An  offshoot  of  the  festival  is  the  quaintly-named  “queerDoc”,  claim  ing  to  be  the  only  dedicated  gay  and  lesbian  documentary  festival  in  the  world,  and  due  to  be  held  at  the  Chauvel  Cinema,  Paddington,  next   week.   It  is  known  that  Jews  provide  many  world  leaders  in  science,  law,  medicine,  literature  and  film  produc  tion.  Thus  it  won’t  come  as  a  surprise  to  discover  that  at  least  a  quarter  of  the  directors  of  queerDoc  films  this  year  are  Jewish  -  including  Michael  Margolis,  Todd  Ahlberg,  Jay  Rosen  stein,  Barbara  Rosenthal  and  Steven  Pomerantz.   In  a  festival  where  the  question  of  identity  is  reflected  almost  every   where,  two  films  of  Jewish  interest   stand  out   Class  Queers  examines  three  stu  dents  in  the  Triangle  Program  -  an  alternative  high  school  for  gay,  les  bian,  bisexual  and  transgender  teenagers,  located  in  the  basement  of  a  church  in  Toronto,  Canada.   The  “Triangle”  name  derives  from  the  pink  triangles  which  the  Nazis  forced  homosexuals  to  wear.   The  film  focuses  on  three  of  the  program’s  participants  -  Adina,  the   I  “Viewers  are  left  with  a   sense  of  the  deep   loneliness  which  she   will  continue  to  face  as  she  approaches  adulthood”   15-year-old  daughter  of  a  prominent  Conservative  rabbi,  and  17-year-olds   Adam  and  Richard.   Adina  lives  in  North  Toronto  in  a   very  traditional  Jewish  community,  but  is  part  of  a  schizophrenic  exis  tence:  while  her  mother  accepts  her   choice  of  sexuality,  her  father  does  not  and  even  refuses  to  appear  on  camera,  reportedly  fearing  the  under  mining  of  his  position  in  the  Jewish  community.   He  has  also  counselled  his  daugh  ter  on  the  problems  she  will  face  as  a  member  of  two  persecuted  minorities  -  homosexuals  and  Jews.   Clearly,  Adina  is  going  through   adolescence  with  some  institutional  and  family  support,  but  viewers  are  left  with  a  sense  of  the  deep  loneliness   which  she  will  continue  to  face  as  she  approaches  adulthood.   Class  Queers  is  directed  by  Melissa  Levin,  Roxana  Spicer  and  Howard  Fraeburg  and  screens  on  September  5  at  7pm.   Matzo  Maidels,  directed  by  Jenni  Olsen,  Julie  Dorf  and  Monica  Nolan  (September  4  at  7.30pm)  is  a  short  comedy  lesbian  film.   The  festival  also  includes  a  fasci  nating  trio  of  films  (September  7  at  3pm)  on  Middle  Eastern  and  Muslim  gays  and  lesbians:  Pangyau,  a  short  film  about  a  Malaysian  Muslim;  Act  of  Faith,  about  two  gay  Muslim  men;  and  I  Exist,  which  explores  the  lives  of   Scene  from  Class  Queers.   a  number  of  American  gays  and  les  bians  of  Iranian,  Turkish  and  Arab  descent  who  are  dealing  with  their  homosexuality.   All  coming  from  traditional  back  grounds,  the  characters  in  I  Exist  are  united  in  their  desperate  and  touching  desire  to  be  accepted  by  their  families,   while  still  expressing  their  sexuality.   These  are  young  men  and  women  caught  between  traditional  cultures  and  libertarian  expressiveness;  their  articulateness  and  longing  to  be  included  in  both  is  fascinating,  partic  ularly  as  we  sense  that  many  will  be   unsuccessful.

"  ARTS:  A  utopian  experience  —  page  23   Government  urged  to  protect  Muslims   Bernard  Freedman   THE  Coalition  for  the  Reform  of  Refugee  Policy  (CRRP)  has  called  for  more  Federal  Government  action  to  protect  Muslims  and  other  members  of  Middle  Eastern  communi  ties  from  attacks,  threats  and  racist  slurs.   In  a  statement  issued  in  Canberra,  CRRP  spokesmen  Greg  Barns  and  Andrew  Macleod  called  for  the  Howard  government  to  launch  an  advertising  campaign  designed  to  contain  racial  intolerance.   They  said  the  government  should  involve  the  Human  Rights  and  Equal  Opportunity  Commission  in  the  campaign  and  should  seek  media  co-operation.   Melbourne  lawyer  Josh  Bornstein  estab   lished  the  CRRP  in  Melbourne  two  years  ago  to  lobby  for  a  more  humane  and  equitable  refugee  policy  in  Australia.   The  CRRP  wants  an  end  to  detention  of  asy  lum-seekers.   Its  statement,  released  last  week,  said  Islamic  communities  and  people  from  Iraq  and  Iran  now  in  Australia  need  special  protection  following  fires  and  disturbances  at  five  deten  tion  centres  and  a  report  that  the  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria  recently  received  bomb  threats  and  was  subjected  to  other  racist   attacks.   The  statement  said  that  Prime  Minister  John  Howard’s  “sabre  rattling”  on  the  need  for  military  action  against  Iraq  and  the  govern  ment’s  “terror”  advertising  campaign  could   “fuel  further  anti-Muslim  and  Middle  Eastern  sentiment  in  Australia”.   “Attacks  on  Islamic  and  Middle  East  com   munities  and  individuals  is  a  growing  problem  in  our  community,  not  helped  by  the  Bali  bombing  and  well-publicised  ASIO  raids  late  last  year  on  some  individuals,”  the  statement   said.   The  media  had  given  widespread  publicity  to  New  South  Wales  MP  Fred  Nile’s  “ridiculous  call  to  Muslim  women  to  remove  their   chador”;  a  front-page  story  had  been  pub  lished  in  a  Sydney  newspaper  about  “five-star  conditions  in  detention  centres”;  and  talkback  programs  and  letters  to  the  editor  were  “receptacles  for  individuals  who  make  racist  remarks”,  it  added.

"  A  right  to  greater  state  protection   IT  is  unthinkable  for  synagogues  and  other  major  Jewish  institutions   not  to  make  their  own  security  arrangements  these  days  -  security  which  they,  and  therefore,  the  community,  must  pay  for.  Six  synagogues  were  firebombed  in  the  Greater  Sydney  area  during  the  last  Gulf  War,  yet  12  years  later,  not  one  arrest  has  been  made.   Last  weekend,  several  antisemitic  incidents  were  perpetrated  in  Sydney  -  none,  fortunately,  as  serious  as  in  1991,  but  disconcerting  nevertheless.  And  last  year,  an  unprecedented  number  of  antisemitic  incidents  was  logged  by  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry.   V  Eruptions  of  violence  in  the  Middle  East  are  invariably  followed  by  expres   sions  of  hostility  towards  the  Muslim  and  Jewish  communities  in  Australia.   Inevitably,  attacks  on  the  Muslim  community  are  vigorously  condemned  by  political  and  religious  leaders  —  which  is  as  it  should  be  —  including,  it  should  be  noted,  by  leaders  of  the  Jewish  community.   In  comparison,  incidents  which  target  the  Jewish  community  usually  fail  to  elicit  condemnation  from  society’s  leaders  and  generally  pass  unre  marked  -  except,  of  course,  by  the  object  of  the  abuse  or  attack.   Given  that  political  leaders  play  a  pivotal  role  in  setting  standards  of  what  is  acceptable  and  unacceptable  in  society,  and  in  determining  what  passes  for  the  norm  and  what  does  not,  such  silence  is  counterproductive.   One  has  only  to  cast  one’s  mind  back  to  Pauline  Hanson’s  maiden  speech  in  Federal  Parliament  on  September  10,1996,  when  she  called  for  multicul  turalism  to  be  abolished,  denounced  political  correctness  and  claimed  that  Aborigines  received  more  many  privileges  than  non-Aborigines  did.   Instead  of  unequivocally  condemning  her  comments,  the  Prime  Minis  ter  defended  her  right  to  make  them  -  effectively  giving  the  signal  to  vast   numbers  to  echo  her  sentiments  on  the  talkback  airwaves.   Only  when  Federal  Parliament,  much  later,  passed  a  bilateral  motion  upholding  multiculturalism  and  denouncing  her  remarks  did  the  callers  retreat.  The  point  is  clear.  Leaders,  particularly  political  leaders,  set  the  tone.   Last  Saturday,  Bob  Carr  cruised  to  a  third  term  as  Premier.  His  cam   paign  theme  was  “There  is  more  work  to  do”.  The  reference  was  to  such  issues  as  health,  transport,  education  and  the  war  on  drugs.  Equally  pressing  is  the  less  tangible  question  of  racial  and  ethnic  harmony.   Clearly,  the  election  was  overshadowed  by  global  events  -  specifically,  the  '  ?  war  on  Iraq,  Australia’s  involvement  in  it  and  the  spectre  of  terrorism.   Yet  the  need  for  greater  respect  and  acceptance  of  differences  is  the  nexus  between  national  and  state  issues;  it  stems  from  the  heightened  state  of  world  tension  and  fear  of  terrorism,  and  it  is  an  issue  which  needs  to  be  addressed  at  state,  as  well  as  at  federal  level.   Opposition  Leader  John  Brogden  put  it  well  in  an  interview  with  the  Australian  Jewish  News  last  week,  when  he  said  it  is  not  enough  to  promote  tolerance;  it  is  equally  important  to  condemn  intolerance.   Premier  Carr  -  a  staunch  ally  of  this  community  with  a  peerless  record  in  speaking  out  on  inter-racial  harmony  -  last  year  launched  a  forum  designed  to  facilitate  dialogue  between  Jewish,  Muslim  and  other  commu   nal  leaders.   It  was  a  commendable  initiative  which  will  hopefully  bear  fruit.  But  it  is  not  enough.  The  Jewish  community  has  a  right  to  expect  greater  state  pro  tection  for  its  members  and  its  institutions.  And  it  has  a  right  to  expect  more  vigorous  condemnation  from  political  leaders  when  its  members  and  instrumentalities  are  targeted  for  abuse  or  worse.   As  the  Labor  Party  campaign  stated,  there  is  work  to  do. ",2003-03-28
"  Islam  and  the  West   BOOK  REVIEW   NEER  KORN   THE  CRISES  OF  ISLAM:  HOLY  WAR  AND  UNHOLY  TERROR   Bernard  Lewis   Weidenfeld  &amp;  Nicholson,  2002,224  pages,  $35   FOR  the  past  few  years  many  people  have  been  asking  some  questions  about  the  Islamic  world  that  Jews  have  been  asking  for  a  lot  longer:  Why  do  they  hate  us?  What  are  they  so  angry  and  frustrated  about?  And   what  is  it  with  the  new  wave  of  ter  rorism  in  the  form  of  suicide  bombers?   Bernard  Lewis  answers  these   questions  in  their  much  broader  context  in  The  Crises  of  Islam,  based  on  an  article  which  first  appearing  in  the  New  Yorker  magazine.   In  explaining  the  root  causes   behind  the  rise  of  fundamentalism   Lewis  takes  readers  on  a  fascinating,  at  times  gripping,  journey  through  Islamic  history  and  geopolitics  to   current  times.   His  explanation,  summarised  in  two  words,  is  a  combination  of  “humiliation”  and  “self-confidence”   Lewis  is  well  qualified  for  the  job.  He  is  professor  of  near-eastern  stud  ies  at  Princeton  University  and  the  author  of  countless  books,  all  cover  ing  that  region  and  its  people.   In  its  glory  days  Islam  was  an  enormous  empire  extending  from  “Morocco  to  Indonesia,  from  Kaza  khstan  to  Senegal”.   While  Europe  went  to  sleep  fol  lowing  the  fall  of  the  Greek  and  Roman  empires,  and  remained  in  that  state  for  a  very  long  time,  Islam  flourished  from  its  birth  in  the  sev   enth  century  CE  until  Europe  final  ly  woke  up  and  colonised.   The  Islamic  world,  Lewis  tells  us,  is  simply  not  happy  at  having  “lost  its  dominance  and  its  leadership”  and  at  falling  behind  “both  the  modem  West  and  the  rapidly  mod  ernising  Orient”.   Worse  still  they  feel  “dominated  and  exploited  by  those  same  infi  dels”  that  the  empire  set  out  to  con  vert  in  the  first  place.   The  realisation  in  the  mid’70s  of   the  power  and  riches  of  oil  provided  Muslims  with  the  catalyst  for  a  renewed  sense  of  contempt  for  the   West  and  its  social  values.   Radical  Islamism,  Lewis  explains,  is  not  one  simple  movement.  “There  are  many  types  of  Islamic  funda   mentalism  ...  sometimes  within  a  single  country.  Some  are  state  spon  sored  and  others  are  genuine  popu  lar  movements.”   Ultimately,  it  is  all  the  about  interpretation  of  Islamic  texts,  and  their  version  regards  the  west  as  “the  source  of  the  evil  that  is  corroding  Muslim  society”.   Regarding  the  murder  of  inno  cent  civilians,  Lewis  concludes  that  “at  no  point  do  the  basic  texts  of  Islam  enjoin  terrorism  and  murder.  At  no  point  -  as  far  as  I  am  aware  -  do  they  even  consider  the  random  slaughter  of  uninvolved  bystanders.”   |  The  realisation  in  the   j  mid-70s  of  the  power  |  and  riches  of  oil   I  provided  Muslims  with   I  the  catalyst  for  a   |  renewed  sense  of   J  contempt  for  the  West   I  and  its  social  values.   As  for  suicide  bombers,  the  Koran  here  too,  is  unequivocal.  Lewis  quotes  their  Prophet  Mohammed  “whomever  kills  him  self  with  a  blade  will  be  tormented  with  that  blade  in  the  fires  of  hell”.   Readers  will  not  be  surprised  at  Lewis’  assessment  that  hating  Israel  is  a  convenient  panacea  for  the  ills  experienced  in  Muslim  countries;  it  serves  a  useful  stand-in  for  com   plaints  about  the  economic  priva  tion  and  political  repression  under  which  most  Muslim  people  live.   The  good  news  is  that  there  are  plenty  of  Muslims  repulsed  and  ashamed  by  fundamentalist  inter  pretations  and  actions.  For  Israel’s  sake  especially,  let  us  hope  they  pre   vail.   Otherwise,  Lewis  concludes,  any  peace  process  will  only  be  regarded  as  a  step  toward  the  true  final  solu  tion,  the  dissolution  of  the  state  of  IsraeL   Neer  Korn  is  director  of  social  research   company  Heartbeat.

"  Moderate  Muslims  must  take  the  next  step   VIEWPOINT   GEOFFREY  ZYGIER   I  “The  Islamic  Youth   Movement  is  brazen  in  its  intolerance,   contempt  and  hatred  for  societies,  religions  and  individuals  not   I  sharing  its  beliefs.”   !  RECENTLY  had  the  rare  pleasure  of   finding  myself  in  general  agreement  with  Sunday  Age  writer  Terry  Lane.   This  was  prompted  by  Lane’s  “Perspective”  column  of  December  8,  2002,  devoted  to  the  Islamic  Youth  Movement(IYM).   I  remembered  the  IYM  from  the  time   I  managed  the  Multicultural  Affairs  Section  of  the  then-Department  of  Immigration  and  Multicultural  Affairs,  and  I  was  intrigued  to  see  whether  it  had  been  further  radicalised  by  recent  events.   The  IYM  is  apparently  based  at  Lakemba  Mosque,  the  largest  mosque  in  Sydney.  It  undertakes  Islamic  education,  welfare,  sport  and  recreation,  and  oper   ates  a  media  office.   The  last-mentioned  publishes  Nida’ul  Islam,  a  bimonthly  magazine  in  Arabic  and  English  (available  at  http://islam.org.au).   It  was  the  latest  edition  of  the  online   magazine  that  prompted  Lane’s  ire.  Of  concern  was  an  article  that  advised  Muslims  to  have  nothing  to  do  with  Christmas  as  it  constituted  a  “gross  event  of  falsehood”.   This  prohibition  extended  as  far  as  any  commercial  activity  relating  to  the  “festiv  ities  of  the  idolators”,  attending  Christmas  parties  or  even  extending  sea  sonal  greetings.   Another  piece  described  Jews  as  “monkeys  and  swine”  and  “people  of  cowardliness,  dismay  and  weakness  and,  if  they  fight  against  you,  they  will  show  you  their  backs”.   (Incidentally,  Lane  continued  with  a  possible  sideswipe  at  Muslims  and  Jews,  describing  this  statement  as  “a  perplexing  insult  for  the  Muslims  of  Palestine,  who  would  be  hard  pressed  to  remember  when  they  last  saw  Jews  running  away”).   Nida’ul  Islam’s  hateful  invective  is   hardly  surprising  when  one  looks  at  its   Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hilaly,  Imam  of  Lakemba  Mosque.   goals,  particularly  the  following:   •  Reflecting  the  views  of  the  Jihad  stream  among  Islamic  movements.   •  Standing  up  to  the  Zionist-crusade  [sic]  assaults  against  Islam.   •  Striving  towards  producing  a  section  in  society  which  understands  Islam,  and  which  realises  that  Jihad  is  the  only  path   to  establish  the  Islamic  State.   •  Confronting  the  misconseptions  promoted  by  the  deviated  sects,  support  ed  by  the  international  Jeudo  movements  and  the  Free  Masons  [sic].   •  Giving  the  youth  generation  the  attention  it  requires,  since  it  forms  the  fuel  for  the  Islamic  movement  in  general  and  the  Jihad  stream  in  specific  [sic].   Given  Nida’ul  Islam's  threatening  aims,  I  found  that  the  mocking  tone  of  Lane’s  column  detracted  from  its  message  -  that  even  if  those  involved  with  the  IYM  are  not  a  direct  danger  to  the  Australian  community,  their  ideas  are  inimical  to  a  tolerant  society.   I  was  further  surprised  that  Lane  did  not  see  fit  to  comment  on  two  other  arti   cles  in  the  October-November  edition  of  Nida’ul  Islam.   The  first  was  a  fierce  attack  on  sexual  child  abuse  by  Catholic  and  Protestant  clergy.  Why  publish  this  snide  article  in  a  Muslim  magazine?   The  second  article,  “Australians  shoot  ing  for  Israel?”,  is  equally  scurrilous.  It  quotes  a  dubiously  sourced  two-year-old  article  stating  that  an  offshoot  of  the  Jewish  Defence  League  had  been  operat  ing  a  summer  camp  to  train  Jews  in  the  use  of  guns  and  martial  arts.   Without  querying  whether  such  train  ing  was  for  offensive  or  defensive  purpos  es,  author  Dawood  Yusuf  employs  a  warped  leap  of  logic  in  stating  that  this  is  the  purpose  of  “youth  camps”  in  Israel  for  young  Australian  Jews.   Which  young  Australian  Jews?  What  youth  camps?  Yusuf  fails  to  clearly  tell  us,  although  he  does  suggest  some  cover-up  as  Israeli  Embassy  officials  and  the  Australian  Federal  Police  have  dismissed  Muslim  accusations.   The  article  concludes:  “It  seems  likely   the  Federal  Government,  armed  with  the  ‘anti-terror’  laws,  will  ensure  the  hype  of  the  US  ‘war  on  terrorism’  is  maintained,  and  whilst  supposedly  hunting  down  ‘Muslim  suspects’,  it  will  actually  provide  the  necessary  cover  for  Australian  Jews  joining  Israeli  military  forces  for  ‘army  experience’.”   No  proof,  no  analysis,  just  blather  designed  to  foment  paranoia  and  hatred  in  the  ignorant  and  prejudiced.   Middle  East  expert  Daniel  Pipes  recently  commented:  “Islamists  seeking  to  advance  their  agenda  within  Western,   non-Muslim  environments  cannot   frankly  divulge  their  views  and  still  remain  players  in  the  political  game.   “So  as  not  to  arouse  fears  and  isolate   themselves,  these  individuals  and  organi  sations  usually  cloak  their  outlook  in  moderate  language”  (“Jihad  and  the  Professors”,  Commentary,  November  2002).   The  Islamic  Youth  Movement  has  no   such  qualms.  It  is  brazen  in  its  intoler  ance,  contempt  and  hatred  for  societies,  religions  and  individuals  not  sharing  its   beliefs.   Since  September  11,  2001,  there  have  been  countless  articles  and  letters  by  pro  fessedly  moderate  Islamic  leaders  in  Australia  stating  that  Islam  is  a  religion  of  peace,  and  that  terrorist  acts  committed  in  its  name  are  an  aberration.  All  peace  loving  persons  will  applaud  these  pro   nouncements.   To  ensure  these  leaders’  credibility,  however,  it  is  incumbent  upon  them  to  go  one  step  further  by  renouncing  and  out  lawing  the  Islamic  Youth  Movement  and  other  organisations  of  its  ilk.

"  Festival  of  learning  explores  250  issues   Hagai  Segal   Photos:  Richard  Center   Photography   Sam  Glaser   Dr  Pesach  Schindler   Andrew  Klein   Dr  Rachael  Kohn   Danny  Rubinstein   ABC  Radio  presenter  Dr  Rachael  Kohn  had  always  regarded  herself  as  a  “learning  machine  -  but  I  didn’t   realise  it  could  be  so  much  fun”.   Dr  Kohn  was  speaking  at  the  opening  night  of  Limmud-Oz  -  the  festival  of  Jewish  learning  and  cul  ture  presented  by  The  Shalom  Insti  tute  over  the  long  weekend.   About  850  people  attended  Lim  mud-Oz,  enrolling  for  250  presenta  tions  comprising  workshops,  debates,  lectures  and  performances  by  200  local  and  overseas  scholars.   The  opening  night  featured  a  panel  discussion  on  “Living  in  an  Unsafe  World:  Jewish  responses  to  the  fears  of  the  21st  century”.   Jerusalem  scholar  Dr  Pesach  Schindler  laid  out  the  parameters  for  the  discussion  by  identifying  four   factors  that  characterise  the  contem   porary  period:  globalisation,  real  time  technology,  mobility  and  geopolitical  alignments.   The  traditional  Jewish  under  standing  of  “fear”  is  “awe  and  trem  bling”,  but  we  should  not  be  afraid,   he  said.   Nevertheless,  we  have  reasons  to  be  concerned  for  the  repercussions  of  globalisation,  including  the  threat  to  individuality  and  identity.   Technology  is  stealing  the  “moments  of  contemplation”  which  we  need,  and  mobility  is  denying  us   our  “rootedness”.   But  we  cannot  afford  the  luxury   l   of  fear,  which  may  lead  to  paralysis.  Our  state  of  mind  needs  to  enable  us  to  “walk  between  geopolitical  rain  drops”  so  that  we  can  respond  ade  quately  to  Israel’s  volatile  neighbours  and  tackle  the  challenges  ahead.   Journalist  Danny  Rubinstein,  also  from  Jerusalem,  and  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  scholar,  elaborat  ed  on  the  threat  to  Israel  and  the  fears  engendered  by  suicide   bombers.   US  President  George  Bush  had  described  such  terrorists  as  being  motivated  by  “poverty  and  igno  rance”  and  called  them  “lunatics”;  in   reality,  however,  they  are  normal,  middle-class  people  motivated  by  despair,  Rubinstein  said.   Only  by  creating  hope  can  we  counter  this  despair,  concluded  Rubinstein,  to  resounding  applause.   Dr  Kohn  spoke  of  the  change  in  attitude  among  intellectuals  and  aca  demics,  whereby  there  is  now  no  understanding  for  Israel  or  Jewish   interests.   Hamas  is  not  condemned,  Arafat  is  dismissed  as  a  harmless  buffoon  and  terrorist  attacks  against  Israel  are  viewed  as  “predictable”,  she  said.   The  negative  outpouring  against  Israel  has  led  to  a  sense  of  insecurity  among  Jews  and  a  fear  that  public  opinion  is  either  against  Israel  or  uninterested  in  its  fate,  she  said.   The  Australian  Jewish  communi  ty  fears  that  if  terrorism  occurs  here,   many  will  view  it  as  “the  punishment   it  deserves”.   Alliances  between  anti-globalisa  tion  groups  have  created  a  move  ment  that  wants  to  escape  from  history,  she  said;  this  is  a  genuine  fear  for  Jews  in  the  21st  century.   British  academic  and  Mid-East  analyst  Hagai  Segal  questioned  the  reality  of  the  threats,  using  examples  to  illustrate  that  perceptions  are  often  distorted,  creating  illusions  of  danger.   “Terrorism  is  a  threat  to  Israel’s   psyche,  but  not  existence,”  he  said.   “The  real  threat  to  her  existence  is  demographics,  which  is  why  left  and  right  have  united  in  demanding  a   two-state  solution.”   Although  neo-Nazis  have  estab  lished  links  with  Muslim  extremists,  there  is  an  irony  in  the  fact  that  the  forces  which  have  radicalised  the  Muslim  world  have  also  vitalised  anti-Muslim  sentiment.   The  evening  concluded  with  an  energetic  performance  by  the  Nadya-Giga  Gypsy  Band  and  the   101  Candles  Orchestra.   Andrew  Klein,  who  compered  the  event,  commented  on  the  wealth  of  talent  and  intellect  available  to  Lim   mud-Oz  participants.  Limmud-Oz  continued  on  Sunday  and  Monday.

"  EXECUTIVE  COUNCIL  OF  AUSTRALIAN  JEWRY  ANNUAL  CONFERENCE   Essential  to‘create  a   cost’  for  antisemitism   AVIVA  BARD   IT  is  important  to  “form  alliances”  and  “to  create  a  cost”  for  anti  semitism,  ECAJ  president  Jeremy  Jones  stressed.   “Most  people  don’t  do  antisemitic  acts  if  there’s  a  cost.”  The  message  has  to  be  that  “racist  violence  is  unaccept  able  -  that  you’re  not  just  taking  on  the  Jews,  you’re  taking  on  Australia”.   The  number  of  antisemitic  inci   dents  involving  physical  assault,  property  damage  and  face-to-face  harassment  was  at  the  highest  level  ever  -  the  second  successive  year  in   which  records  have  been  set.   A  total  of540  antisemitic  incidents   were  logged  in  the  12-month  period  ending  September  30,2003  -  the  sec  ond-highest  total  in  15  years.   They  included  arson  attacks  on  shuls,  assaulting  a  rabbi  and  throwing  rocks  through  kosher  outlets.   The  number  is  “the  tip  of  the  ice  berg”,  Jones  said,  as  reports  are  excluded  if  they  cannot  be  deter   mined  to  be  antisemitic.   “We  have  extreme  left  and  Muslim  groups  working  together  on  a  com  mon  anti-Israel  and  anti-Jewish  agen   da.  We’ve  seen  incidents  where  what  purports  to  be  criticism  of  Israel  has  become  slander  of  Jews.”   More  than  half  of  the  perpetrators  could  not  be  identified,  while  of  the  other  half,  three-quarters  were  from  the  far-right   Sixteen  per  cent  were  from  far-left  groups  and  10  per  cent  from  Arab  or   Muslim  sources.   Participating  in  a  forum  on  anti  semitism  in  Jerusalem  in  July,  Jones  said  “the  issues  are  international,  but  they  determine  how  we  can  respond  here”.   Topics  of  discussion  included  how  to  get  prominent  people  to  “respond  automatically,  not  because  the  Jewish  community  asks,  but  because  they  are  of  a  mindset  to  say  ‘this  is  wrong’.”   Australia  is  far  better  off  than  many  communities,  although  “many  in  the   churches  would  be  horrified  to  think  they  would  have  a  tolerance  for  anti  semitism,  yet  don’t  flinch  when  it’s  enshrined:  in  anti-Israel  sentiment”.

"  Sheikh  Hilaly  ‘is  no  moderate’   AVIVA  BARD   A  COLUMN  by  Sun-Herald  journal  ist  Miranda  Devine  which  describes  Lakemba  Mosque  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hilaly  as  “a  powerful  voice  of  moder  ation”  has  been  strongly  criticised  by  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones.   On  January  14,  2002,  the  Aus  tralian  Arab  newspaper  El  Telegraph  quoted  Hilaly  as  saying  that  suicide  killings  were  legitimate,  and  those  who  rejected  them  were  not  authentic   Muslims.   At  a  Beirut  conference  of  50  Mus   lim  scholars,  which  included  Hilaly,  last  year,  suicide  bombings  against  “Zionists”  were  lauded  as  “the  highest  form  of  martyrdom”.   The  conference  also  praised  the  terrorist  groups  Hamas,  Islamic  Jihad,  and  Hezbollah,  saying  they   “defend  the  honour  of  Muslims”.   Hilaly  has  never  apologised  for  a  1988  speech  at  the  University  of  Syd  ney  in  which  he  described  Jews  as  “the  underlying  cause  of  all  wars  threaten  ing  the  peace  and  security  of  the   whole  inhabited  earth”  and  a  “cancer   engendered  in  European  society  imposed  on  our  land”.   In  April  2002,  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Roth  man  and  Great  Synagogue  Senior  Rabbi  Raymond  Apple  were  criticised  for  authorising  a  joint  Jewish-Islamic  statement  with  Hilaly  and  Keysar  Trad,  calling  for  dialogue  in  the  Middle  East   and  an  end  to  hostilities  between  Mus  lims  and  Jews  in  Australia.   In  her  column  in  the  Sun-Herald  on  June  15,  Devine  wrote:  “Sheikh  Hilaly’s  strength  in  facing  up  to  the  [Islamic  Youth  Movement]  and  other  extremist  groups  which  have  tried  to  infiltrate  his  mosque  over  the  years  has  earned  him  enemies  within  the  Muslim  community  and  little  thanks   outside.”   “But  if  you  accept  the  view  that  the  war  against  terrorism  is  not  a  ‘clash  of  civilisations’  between  Islam  and  the  West,  but  a  struggle  between  moder  ates  and  militants  within  the  Muslim  world,  then  Hilaly  is  a  powerful  ally.”   Addressing  the  Board  of  Deputies  last  week,  Jones  said  Hilaly  “has  ratio  nalised  suicide  terrorism  and  depict  ed  Jews  as  the  enemy  of  all  humanity”.   “There  was  a  battle  at  Lakemba  Mosque  in  1998  and  Hilaly  was  opposed  to  the  IYM  at  that  time,”  he   Sheikh  Tajeadin  ai  Hiiaiy  (right)  with  Lebanese  iviusiim  Association  spokesperson  KeysarTrad  at  an  interfaith  forum  in  Darling  Harbour  earlier  this  year.   Miranda  Devine’s  column  in  the  Sun-Herald  on  June  15.   later  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News.   “There  is  little  to  justify  the  conclu  sion  that  this  was  a  fight  between  extremists  and  moderates.  There  was   a  pre-existing  relationship  between  the  IYM,  Hilaly  and  his  assistant,  Keysar  Trad,  which  suggests  this  split  may  not  have  been  simply  ideological.   “Suddenly  Hilaly  is  being  presented  as  a  moderate,  which  is  not  only  hard  to  sustain,  but  unfair  to  the  very  many  genuine  moderates  within  the  leader  ship  of  Australia’s  Islamic  community.   “It’s  important  to  support  moder  ates  against  extremists,  but  one  should  not  present  Hilaly  as  a  role   model  for  moderation.   Lebanese  Muslim  Association   spokesperson  Keysar  Trad:  “I  wasn’t  close  to  Hilaly  at  the  time  he  made  the  comments  [at  the  University  of  Syd  ney],  but  that  is  not  the  way  he  talks.  I  can  only  assume  his  comments  were  lost  in  the  translation.   “He  can’t  understand  why  people  keep  raising  this  old  issue,  bearing  in  mind  all  the  bridge-building  that  has  been  taking  place,  especially  when  he  has  such  high  respect  for  many  lead  ers  in  the  Jewish  community.   “Sure  he’s  had  dealings  with  peo  ple  who  don’t  behave  in  the  best  way,   but  that’s  countered  by  the  dealings  with  decent  people  he’s  happy  to  have   as  friends.”   The  target  of  ASIO  raids  since  the  2000  Olympics,  the  Lakemba-based  Islamic  Youth  Movement  enjoyed  the  support  of  Hilaly  and  Trad  -  who   translated  articles  for  the  movement’s  extremist  Nida’ul  Islam  (Call  to  Islam)  magazine  -  until  at  least  1998.   A  recent  ABC  Four  Corners  pro  gram  revealed  that  Lebanese-born  Bilal  Khazal,  involved  with  Nida’ul  Islam,  had  been  named  in  a  CIA  docu  ment  as  being  affiliated  with  al-Qaeda.   “In  June  last  year  the  CIA  named  Khazal  in  its  report  on  al-Qaeda’s  increasing  presence  in  Australia,”  Four   Corners  stated.   “Hilaly  has  rationalised  suicide  terrorism  and  depicted  Jews  as  the   enemy  of  all  humanity.”   JEREMY  JONES  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry   A  former  Qantas  baggage-handler,  Khazal  was  removed  from  the  posi  tion  in  the  run-up  to  the  Olympics.  He  had  been  in  Afghanistan  in  1998  and  his  passport  was  confiscated  in  Australia  in  February  last  year.   The  Nida’ul  Islam  website  has  fea  tured  interviews  with  jihad  leaders,  including  Osama  bin  Laden  calling  for  the  need  to  “purify  our  sacred  land  from  the  Jews  and  Christians”.   “I  don’t  have  any  association  with  the  magazine;  I  only  translated  arti  cles,”Trad  said.  “I  ceased  in  1998  or  ’99.   “I  may  or  may  not  agree  with   material  I’ve  translated.  There  are   times  I’m  translating  that  I  cringe,  but  I  have  to  be  faithful  to  the  author.  The  content  is  not  my  responsibility.   “We  look  at  the  Jewish  community  as  cousins.  We  have  so  much  in  com  mon,  I  don’t  understand  why  there  is  so  much  misunderstanding.”   Said  Jones:  “Until  a  brawl  in  1998  between  the  IYM  and  supporters  of  the  Lebanese  Muslim  Association,  the  IYM  was  tolerated  to  a  ridiculous  extreme   by  the  organised  Lebanese  community.   “What  they  say  about  Jews  in  their  magazine  is  unconscionable.  People   could  be  incited  to  violence.  The  mate  rial  is  offensive,  given  that  they  pro  mote  themselves  as  a  group  that  tries  to  give  leadership  to  Islamic  youth.” ",2003-06-27
"  MP  lashes  claims  of  Jewish  conspiracy  behind  the  war   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   LIBERAL  MP  Peter  King  has  hit  out  at  those  who  suggested  Jewish  or  Israeli  motives  behind  American  foreign  policy  and  the  war  against  Iraq,  as  well  as  at  recent  parliamen  tary  critics  of  Israel  and  the  Jewish  community.   “Australian  and  American  for   eign  policy  towards  Iraq  has  been  based  on  nothing  more  than  our  desire  to  see  a  tyrant  overthrown  and  weapons  of  mass  destruction  destroyed,”  he  told  Federal   Parliament.   “To  suggest  sinister  motives  founded  on  an  absurd  understand  ing  of  Jewish  culture  or  outlook  is  patently  wrong  and  deserves  our   condemnation.”   Previous  comments  by  Labor  MPs  Tania  Plibersek,  who  described  Israel  as  a  rogue  state  and  its  prime  minister  as  a  war  criminal,  and  by  Julia  Irwin,  who  referred  to  the  Jew  ish  community  as  arrogant,  served  those  who  wished  to  stoke  the  flames  of  anti-Semitism,  King  added.   He  was  commenting  on  an  open  letter  from  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  alerting  political,  community  and  religious  leaders  to  incidents  of  vilification  against  Australia’s  Jew  ish  community  as  a  result  of  Aus  tralia’s  involvement  in  Iraq.   “Unfortunately,  this  kind  of  vili  fication  does  occur  in  Australia,”  he  said,  referring  to  the  “Kill  the  Jews”  graffiti  in  Condell  Park,  Sydney,  an  arson  attempt  on  a  synagogue  in  Sydney’s  south-west,  an  attack  on  the  Jewish  museum  in  Melbourne   MP  Peter  King...  “Just  as  we  should  condemn  attacks  on  Muslim   communities,  we  must  resoundingly  reject  the  actions  that  make  Jewish   Australians  feel  unsafe  or   uncomfortable  in  any  part  of  our   nation.”   and  antisemitic  graffiti  at  the  entrance  to  the  University  of   New  South  Wales.   “They  are  just  a  few  examples,”  King  said.  “I  know  from  the  experi  ences  of  the  Jewish  community  in  my  electorate  that  they  are  not  iso   lated  instances.   “The  letter  was  a  timely  reminder  of  the  role  we  all  must   play  in  ensuring  that  international   events  do  not  lead  to  the  harass   ment  of  sections  of  our  great  multi  cultural  community.   “Just  as  we  should  condemn   attacks  on  Muslim  communities,  .  we  must  resoundingly  reject  the  actions  that  make  Jewish  Aus  tralians  feel  unsafe  or  uncomfort   able  in  any  part  of  our  nation.” ",2003-04-04
"  Kazak  attacks  war  aims,   wants  pressure  on  Israel   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   PALESTINIAN  representative  in  Australia  Ali  Kazak  has  attacked  Australian,  American  and  British  war  objectives  in  Iraq,  saying  the  Palestinians  are  “the  only  people  who  need  freedom  from  55  years  of  tyranny  and  bloody  occupation  in   the  Middle  East”.   Criticising  the  Australian  media  for  uncritical  reporting  of  the  coali  tion’s  objectives  against  Iraq,  Kazak  called  for  US,  British  and  Australian  forces  to  force  Israel  to  comply  with  UN  resolutions,  withdraw  from  the  territories  and  get  rid  of  Israel’s  weapons  of  mass  destruction.   He  said  this  was  the  only  way  to  calm  Arab  and  Muslim  people  around  the  world  who  were  “boiling  with  rage  at  this  hypocrisy  and  dou  ble  standard  between  Israel’s  occupa  tion  and  gross  violations  and  Iraq”.   “Otherwise,  destabilisation,  ter  rorism  and  wars  will  be  the  land  marks  of  the  21st  century,”  he  said.   “Officials  used  to  say  that  their  objectives  were  to  force  Iraq  to  com  ply  with  international  laws  and  UN  Resolution  1441  and  get  rid  of  Iraq’s  weapons  of  mass  destruction,”  Kazak  said.  “Now  they  say  their  objectives  are  to  bring  freedom  and  democracy  to  the  Iraqi  people.   “Everyone  knows  that  the  only  people  who  need  freedom  from  55  years  of  tyranny  and  bloody  occu  pation  are  the  Palestinian  people.  But  despite  this,  the  media  do  not   question  these  officials’  blatant  dis  respect  of  peoples’  intelligence.   “Israel’s  occupation  and  war  crimes  against  the  Palestinian  peo  ple  are  carried  out  with  America’s  latest  weapons,  American  finance  and  American  political  protection.

"  Path  to  genocide  laid  with  linguistic  stones   BEYOND  WORDS   RUTH  WAJNRYB   I  was  saddened  by  the  Holocaust  references,   the  underlying  theme  of  prejudice  and  atrocity  amid  the  non-Jewish  world's  Holocaust  fatigue.   If   N  our  interface  with  the  world,  our  perceptions  are  inevitably  shaped  by  our  own  biographies,  expectations,  values  and   prejudices.   Recently,  I  emerged  from  the  Belvoir  Theatre’s  production  of  The  Cool  Room,  a  play  about  an  imagined  dialogue  between  an  Israeli  and  a  Lebanese  man  who  are  locked  overnight  in  a  restaurant’s  cool  room.   It’s  a  provocative  play.  It  made  me  think  and  question  and  reflect  on  my  assumptions.  The  metaphors  (a  hot  conversation  in  a  cool  room,  the  need  to  share  body  warmth  to  survive)  were  confronting.  The  carcasses  (the  human  cost  of  conflict?)  came  alive  and  with  mocking  irony,  oscillated  between  a  Greek  chorus  role  and  the  barbs  of  a  court  jester.   I  found  myself  wanting  less  even  handedness,  more  pro-Israeliness.  And  I  was  saddened  by  the  Holocaust  refer  ences,  the  underlying  theme  of  preju  dice  and  atrocity  amid  the  non-Jewish  world’s  Holocaust  fatigue.   As  I  walked  out,  I  realised  that,  in  the  tradition  of  political  theatre,  the  play  may  be  hard  to  take  but  ultimate  ly  has  to  be  called  “successful”.   In  front  of  me,  a  woman  turned  to  her  companion  and  said  “Atrocious!  Disgusting!  What  a  waste  of  time!”  She  and  I  had  witnessed  the  same  drama,  but  we  had  not  had  the  same  experi  ence.  In  both  our  cases  the  play’s  mean  ing  was  refracted  through  our  own  perceptual  filters.   A  similar  polarisation  of  reactions  to  events  can  be  seen  on  any  day  on  any  letters  pages.  A  recent  Time  cover  story  published  Ronald  Reagan’s  letters.   The  following  week,  the  letters  pages  captured  the  diversity  of  readers’   responses.  One  said  “Thank  you  for  publishing  Reagans  letters.  I  hope  everyone  will  recognise  the  intelligence  and  the  wonderfully  morality  of  the  man.”  A  similarly  effusive  one  said:  “For  the  beauty  of  those  letters  alone,  I  will  always  regard  Reagan  as  a  truly  great  man.”  And  on  October  16,  the  then  prime  minister  of  Malaysia,  as  host  of  the  10  th  Islamic  Summit  Conference,  delivered  his  opening  address.  The  let  ters  pages  of  our  nation’s  dailies  again  saw  a  polarisation  of  views.   Many  condemned  Dr  Mahathir  Mohamad  and  the  delegates  who  applauded  the  speech,  as  well  as  luke   warm  reactions  of  world  leaders.   But  not  all.  One  letter-writer  to  the   SMH  wrote:  “[Dr  Mahathir]  might  be  mad  or  a  racist  or  both,  but  he  has  first  hand  knowledge  of  the  attempt  by  world  financiers,  Jewish  or  not,  to  com  pletely  destroy  the  Malaysian  economy”   Another  wrote:  “I  don’t  think  I  have  ever  seen  more  compelling  and  damn  ing  proof  of  bias  than  the  widespread  misrepresentation  of  Dr  Mahathir’s  speech...  by  extracting  a  few  words  out  of  context  What  he  actually  did  was  point  to  Jews’  achievements...  then  call  on  Muslims  to  abandon  violence  and  emulate  them  -  and  that  was  called  antisemitism!”   “A  few  words  out  of  context”?  This  was  my  invitation  to  examine  the  ver  batim  text  at  the  Star  Online  of  Octo  ber  17.  There  I  discover  that  the  extracted  quotations  are  perfecdy  true   to  context  and  arise  from  a  sustained   diatribe  against  the  Jews.   Every  which  way  you  look,  there’s  a  conspiracy.  “[The  Jews]  succeeded  in  gaining  control  in  most  of  the  [world’s]  powerful  states.”  And  “The  Europeans  killed  six  million  Jews  out  of  12  million,   but  today  the  Jews   are  in  control  of  the   world  via  their  |  proxies.  They  lead  others  to  fight  and   die  for  them  .”  j   Later,  he  seems  to  applaud  Jewish  achievements:   “They  survived  j   2000  years  of  j   pogroms  not  by  hitting  back  but  by  thinking”,  but  con  tinues:  “They   invented  ...  human  rights  and  democ  racy  so  that  perse  cuting  them  would  appear  to  be  wrong,  so  that  they  can  enjoy  equal  rights  with  others.”   There’s  talk  of  former  glorious  empires.  The  Jews  are  constructed  as   uie  Muslims  naiu   ral  enemy:  “They...  excise  [d]  Muslim  land  to  create  the  State  of  Israel  to  solve  their  Jewish  problem.”  And  “1.3  billion  Muslims  must  not  be  defeated  by  a  few  million  Jews”.  Then  exhortation:  Mus  lim  weapons  have  to  move  from  defence  to  offence,  and  from  “the  time  of  the  prophet”  into  the  modem  world.  And  we  arrive  at:  “We  meed  guns  and  rockets,  bombs  and  warplanes,  tanks  and  warships.”  Dr  Mahathir’s  dreams  are  of  past  grandeur  and  romantic  revival  -  a  time  when  “the  Europeans  had  to  kneel  at  the  feet  of  Muslim  scholars”.   This  is  Nazi-style  rhetoric  the  Jew  is  constructed  as  the  “other”,  the  “out   sider’,  the  “enemy”.  Coupled  with  the  assertion  that  Muslim  survival  is  pred  icated  on  attack  and  destruction  of  the  Jew,  who  needs  further  proof  of  Colin  Tatz’s  argument  that  the  path  to  geno  cide  is  laid  with  linguistic  stones?   It’s  extreme  talk.  It’s  full  of  distor  tions,  concoctions  and  aggressive  pro   nouncements.  But  so  what?   It’s  delivered  rationally  by  an  esteemed  leader  before  an  applauding  audience  on  a  world  stage,  where  you  can  count  on  an  amputated  stump  the  num  ber  of  world  leaders  who  know  how  to  spell  appeasement.

For  several  simple  reasons,  Pales  tinian  support  for  Saddam  goes  back  to  the  first  Gulf  War  12  years  ago:  Saddam  dares  to  confront  the  United  States,  which  many  Palestinians  per  ceive  as  their  enemy;  Saddam  is  per  ceived  as  another  “underdog”  in  the  Middle  East;  and  Saddam  has  been  one  of  the  main  supporters  of  the  Palestinian  intifada,  sending  pay   ments  of  $US10,000  to  $US25,000  to  the  families  of  Palestinians  killed  fighting  Israel,  with  special  premiums  paid  for  suicide  bombers.   Unlike  in  1991,  when  Arafat  open  ly  backed  Saddam’s  invasion  of  Kuwait  and  later  supported  him  against  an  international  -  and  Arab  -  coalition  for  war,  Arafat  this  time  has  avoided  bombastic  statements  of  sup  port  in  favour  of  expressions  of  soli  darity  in  more  subtle  forums,  such  as  greeting  notes  for  Muslim  holidays.   Yet  support  for  Saddam  cuts  across  Palestinian  society.  Thousands   of  demonstrators  in  the  West  Bank   and  Gaza  Strip  have  turned  out  for  pro-Saddam  rallies  at  which  they  bum  American  and  Israeli  flags.   Even  Palestinian  schoolchildren   have  got  into  the  act,  conducting  mock  trials  of  President  Bush.   Friday  prayer  sermons  in  Palestin  ian  mosques  also  use  strong  language:  in  one  recent  prayer  sermon  on  offi  cial  Palestinian  Television,  religious  leader  Ibrahim  Madiras  defined  America  as  “the  foremost  enemy  of  the  Muslim  nation”.   Palestinian  legislator  Ziad  Abu  Ziad  offered  a  different  take.  “I  want  to  tell  you  unequivocally:  there  is  no  support  for  Saddam  Hussein,”  he  said.  “We  support  the  Iraqi  people,  because  we  feel  that  they  are  victims   of  the  situation.   Those  Palestinians  who  sympa  thise  with  Saddam  do  so  out  of  a  shared  hatred  for  Israel,  Abu  Ziad  said.  But  As’ad  Ghanem,  a  political  scientist  at  Haifa  University,  said  most  Palestinians  make  no  distinction  between  Saddam  and  the  Iraqi  people  -  they  support  them  all.

"  POLmCIANS  BARRED  FROM  TEMPLE  MOUNT   JERUSALEM  -  Israeli  police  will  not  allow  Israeli  politicians  to  visit  Jerusalem’s  Temple  Mount  on  Tisha  b’Av.  A  group  of  right-wing  Knesset  members  intended  to  visit  the  place  as  a  demonstration  of  Israeli  sovereignty  over  Judaism's  holiest  site.  A  Muslim  holy  site,  the  Al-Aqsa  Mosque,  now  sits  on  the  mount,  and  the  Palestinians  used  the  occasion  of  Ariel  Sharon's  visit  to  the  site  in  September  2000  to  launch  a  new  intifada.

But  even  though  Sadat  released  many  Islamists  from  Egyptian  prisons,  his  relations  with  the  Muslim  Brother  hood  soured  when  he  signed  the  his  toric  peace  treaty  with  Israel  in  1979,  culminating  in  his  murder  two  years  later,  for  which  al  Zawahiri  was  one  of   The  skyline  after  September  11.   the  radicals  put  in  jaiL   After  his  release,  al  Zawahiri  moved  to  Saudi  Arabia,  then  to  Pakistan,  and  later  to  Afghanistan,  where  he  became  a  doctor  and  a  mentor  to  bin  Laden.   He  has  been  linked  to  the  1997  massacre  of  67  tourists  at  Luxor  in   Egypt  and  to  the  1998  US  embassy  bombings  in  Kenya.   Initially  a  supporter  of  America  as  the  force  that  removed  the  Soviet  Union  from  Afghanistan,  al  Zawahiri  later  developed  a  visceral  hatred  for  western  culture  and  in  the  program  is  seen  making  a  prediction  that  the  US  will  fall  just  as  its  former  superpower  rival  did.  He  is  said  to  have  been  a  key  adviser  to  bin  Laden  on  the  attacks  of   September  11,2001.   The  program  indudes  comments  on  al  Zawahiri  from  contemporaries,  induding  former  cellmates.  There  is  also  a  reflection  from  terrorism  expert  Rohan  Gunaratna  that  promotes  the  commonly  heard  view  that  the  west  shares  some  of  the  blame  for  global   terrorism.   “You  must  ensure  that  your  own  actions  are  not  contributing  to  the  making  of  terrorism.  That  is  where  the  United  States  and  many  European  countries  have  foiled,”  said  Gunaratna.

"  FRENCH  TO  BAN   RELIGION  IN  SCHOOLS?   PARIS  -  Wearing  religious  insignia  in  French  schools  soon  will  become  ille  gal,  according  to  media  reports.  The  Europe  1  radio  station  reported  that  both  French  President  Jacques  Chirac  and  Prime  Minister  Jean-Pierre  Raf  farin  now  support  legislation  that  will  be  “very  strict”.  Leading  left-wing  and  right-wing  politicians  have  recently  called  for  a  law  banning  the  wearing  of  crosses,  yarmulkes  and  Muslim  scarves  in  state  schools.  A  presiden  tial  commission  set  up  earlier  this  year  to  examine  the  secular  nature  of  the  French  state  now  appears  almost  certain  to  recommend  the  legislation  in  its  final  report  next  month.

"  Howard  commissions  Migrant  Defence  Shield   CANBERRA,  Friday:  John  Howard  announced  today  that  he  had  ordered  an  advanced  new  system  to  defend  Australia  against  migrants.  The  Prime  Minister  said  that  the  new  system,  which  will  cost  over  $2  billion,  would   effectively  safeguard  Australia's  borders  from  the  foreigners  he  termed  ""the  greatest  threat  to  our  Australian  way  of  life.""  The  Migrant  Defence  System  is  an  elaborate  system  of  satellite-  based  lasers  which  can  instantly  detect  and  neutralise  any  foreigners  entering  Australia  at  any  point  on  the  nation's  coastline.  A  powerful  laser  beam  is  unleashed  which  vaporises  the  migrant  before  they  can  do  any  harm  to  Australia  or  its  precious  Anglo-Saxon  heritage.  Trials  of  the  new  system  have  identified  a  number  of  teething  problems.  Tests  have  shown  that  it  cannot  distinguish  between  legitimate  refugees  and  illegal  immigrants,  but  Immigration   Minister  Phillip  Ruddock,  who  is  overseeing  its  implementation,  sees  that  that  as  an  advantage.  But  he  is  more  concerned  that  it  cannot  yet  distinguish  between  'desirable'  Anglo-Saxon  migrants  and  those  of  other  backgrounds,  an  essential  requirement  set  by  the  Federal  government.  Nevertheless,  Ruddock  is  confident  that  the  system  will   The  Migrant  Defence  Shield's  successful  test  at  Woomera...  also  conve-  niently  incinerates  protesters   ultimately  be  able  to  discriminate  between  a  white  and  non-white  migrant  to  the  same  extent  that  he  himself  does.  Howard  has  justified  the  shield  as  an  essential  part  of  the  Government's  crucial  compliance  with  American  policy.  ""Allowing  in  too  many  migrants  could  be  extremely  dangerous  to  our  relations  with  the  US  -  we  could  end  up  like  France,""  he  said.  ""They  let  in  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Muslim  immigrants,  and  now  it's  politically  unsustainable  for  their  government  to  sanction  an  unjustified  attack  on  a  Muslim   nation  like  Iraq.  We  have  to  defend  ourselves  against  this  kind  of  obligation  to  respect  other  races  and  cultures.""  The  PM  says  he  will  proceed  with  the  scheme  despite  strong  but  ultimately  futile  opposition  from  the  Greens,  and  weak  but  ultimately  acquiescent  opposition  from  the  ALP  and  Democrats.  ""In  2001,  I  won  a  mandate  from  the  Australian  people  by  arguing  that  we  alone  would  decide  who  came  into  our  country,""  Howard  said.  ""This  system  will  deliver  the  ability  to  do  that  -  and  quickly  fry  anyone  we  don't  into  the  bargain."" ",2003-03-07
"  WORLD  VIEW   'GUARD  PIGS'  FOR  WEST  BANK   JERUSALEM  -  it  may  not  be  100  per  cent  kosher,  but  an  Israeli  organisa  tion  has  received  rabbinical  approval  to  train  pigs  to  guard  West  Bank  set   tlements.

"  Brigitte’s  wife  neither  Jewish  nor  gay   V1CALHADEFF   MELANIE  Brown  -  who  married  al  Qaeda  operative  and  suspected  ter  rorist  Willie  Brigitte  three  months  ago  -  is  neither  Jewish  nor  gay.   This  statement  was  issued  to  the  Australian  Jewish  News  to  refute  a  claim  in  the  Daily  Telegraph  last  week  that  Brown  was  formerly  a  member  of  the  Dayenu  support  group  for  Jew  ish  gays  and  lesbians.   Currently  being  interrogated  in  a  French  prison,  Brigitte  has  been  reported  to  have  plotted  an  attack  on  the  nuclear  reactor  at  Lucas  Heights.   According  to  the  Daily  Telegraph,  Brown  married  Brigitte  in  a  Lakemba  prayer  hall  after  five  dates  and  after  converting  to  Islam.   She  had  been  a  member  of   Dayenu  18  months  earlier  and  had  allegedly  told  Dayenu  members  that  her  mother  was  Jewish  and  had  immigrated  from  Romania,  the  report  said.   However,  Dayenu  spokesman   Malcolm  Davidowitz  said  Brown  had   never  been  a  member  of  Dayenu  and  had  associated  with  Dayenu  members  for  a  few  months  only.   “She  asked  if  she  could  come  to  a   few  of  our  social  gatherings  and  said  she  felt  an  affiliation  with  Jewish  gays,”  he  said.   “She  also  told  us  that  she  was  not  Jewish  and  that  she  had  been  to  Israel  on  exchange  with  the  Australian  Army.

So  she  stopped.   “After  the  2002  Mardi  Gras,  she  hung  around  for  a  couple  of  months,  and  then  we  didn’t  see  her  until  Feb   ruary  this  year,  when  she  went  to  Newtown  Synagogue  with  a  Dayenu   woman.  That  was  the  last  time  we  saw  her.”   Davidowitz  said  Brown  “wasn’t  Muslim”  at  the  time  she  associated   with  Dayenu.  “Apparently,  she  started  studying  Islam  some  time  this  year.   She  had  been  in  East  Timor,  which  is  where  she  was  introduced  to  the  Mus  lim  faith.”   Brown  is  also  believed  to  have   been  to  Temple  Emanuel  several   times.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputes  president  Stephen  Rothman  told  JTA   correspondent  Henry  Benjamin  that  “ASIO  [the  Australian  Security  Intel  ligence  Organisation]  has  told  us  to  stay  tight-lipped  on  this  matter.  It  would  be  inappropriate  to  comment,  other  than  to  say  we  are  aware  that  her  presence  was  felt  within  the  Jew  ish  community”. ",2003-11-21
"  SOLDIER  KILLED  IN  HEBRON   JERUSALEM  -  The  Israeli  Army  decided  to  increase  its  presence  in  Hebron.  The  decision  followed  a   firefight  with  Palestinian  gunmen  on  Monday  in  which  one  soldier  was  killed.  Staff  Sergeant  Tomer  Ron,  20,  was  killed  when  rein  forcements  were  sent  in  to  backup  an  army  foot  patrol  that  came   under  fire  on  the  road  between   Kiryat  Arba  and  the  Tomb  of  the   Patriarchs  in  Hebron.   TWO  PALESTINIANS  KILLED   JERUSALEM  -  Israeli  troops  killed  two  Palestinians  suspected  of  trying  to  plant  a  bomb  near  the   Gaza  settlement  of  Kfar  Darom.  After  a  firefight  the  night  before,  the  Palestinians’  bodies  were  found  on  Tuesday.  In  their  back  packs  were  pipe  bombs.   HAIFA  TOLL  RISES  TO  17   JERUSALEM  -  The  death  toll  from  last  week’s  Haifa  bus  bomb  ing  rose  to  17.

FIRST  ARAB  DEPUTY  MAYOR   JERUSALEM  -  A  former  soccer  star  became  the  first  Israeli  Arab  to   be  appointed  a  deputy  mayor  of  Tel  Aviv-Jaffa.  Mayor  Ron  Huldai  called  the  appointment  of  Jaffa  born  Rifat  “Jimmy”  Turk  “his  toric”.

VICTIMS’  FAMILIES  SUE  ARAFAT   JERUSALEM  -  The  families  of  seven  of  the  11  people  killed  in  a  suicide  bombing  at  a  Jerusalem  cafe  a  year  ago  filed  a  $US27  mil  lion  lawsuit  on  Sunday  against  Yasser  Arafat  and  the  Palestinian   Authority.  The  lawsuit  claimed   that  the  terrorists  who  carried  out  the  attack  were  following  Arafat’s  orders.  The  claimants  said  that  since  the  attack,  they  suffer  from  trauma  and  nightmares.   SUSPECT  NABBED  IN  SHUL  ATTACK   PARIS  -  French  anti-terror  police  arrested  a  man  on  Tuesday  in  con  nection  with  the  attack  last  April  on  a  synagogue  on  the  Tunisian  island  of  Jerba.  The  man,  who  has  yet  to  be  identified,  is  suspected  of  providing  documents  and  other   items  to  Nizar  Ben  Mohammed  Nawar,  who  is  suspected  of  carry  ing  out  the  attack.  Three  men,  including  Nawar’s  brother,  have  already  been  charged  by  French  police  in  connection  with  the  attack.  Nineteen  people,  including  14  German  tourists,  were  killed  last  year  after  a  gas  truck  exploded  when  it  rammed  a  wall  protecting  the  Ghriba  Synagogue.   MUSLIM  PREACHER  SENTENCED   LONDON  -  A  London-based  Muslim  preacher  convicted  on  hate  crimes  charges  was  sentenced  last  Friday  to  nine  years  in  jail.   Abdullah  el-Faisal  was  found  guilty  last  month  of  encouraging  followers  to  kill  Jews,  Hindus  and  other  non-believers.

"  CROSSED  THE  LINE   MAHATHIR  criticised  Muslims   more  than  he  critiqued  Jews  in  his  speech  (AJN24/10/03).   Nevertheless,  one  must  not  forget   the  core  essence  of  his  remarks  -  die  r  “Jewish  problem”,  which  was  a  com  mon  feature  of  Hitler’s  speeches.   Mahathir  crossed  the  line  into  antisemitism  when  he  stated:  “The  Europeans  killed  six  million  Jews  out  of  12  million.  But  today  the  Jews  rule  this  world  by  proxy.  They  get  others  to  fight  and  die  for  them.”   Mahathir  has  mentioned  in  numerous  interviews  following  his  controversial  speech  that  the  basis  of  his  words  was  to  inspire  Muslim  to  progress  intellectually.  Surely,  he  could  have  done  that  without  men  tioning  the  Holocaust  and  without  indirecdy  degrading  a  fellow  nation.   BENJAMIN  RAYMOND   Perth,  WA ",2003-10-31

"  Justice  Marcus  EInfeld...  ""Find  the   forces  In  Islam  who  will  work  with  us.”   Stephen  Morris...  Europe  is  a  “demographic  timebomb'’.   ‘Deal  with  the  enemy’   MICHAEL  CAVANAGH   JUSTICE  Marcus  Einfeld  has  urged  Jews  to  “find  the  forces  in  Islam  who  will  work  with  us”,  even  if  they  find  this  “distasteful”.   This  was  the  only  way  to  deal  with  terrorism,  he  told  a  seminar  at  Parliament  House  in  Canberra.   “We  must  face  the  idea  that  however  distasteful  it  sometimes   is  to  deal  with  the  enemy,  we  have   to  find  the  forces  in  Islam  who  will  work  with  us,”  he  said.   Organised  by  Labor  MP  Michael  Danby,  the  forum  was   held  to  coincide  with  a  dinner   later  that  night  to  farewell  outgo  ing  Israeli  Ambassador  Gabby  Levy.   Former  Hawke  government  minister  Barry  Cohen,  Geoff   Barker  of  the  Australian  Financial   Review  and  Professor  Stephen  Morris  joined  Justice  Einfeld  in  discussing  “Gerba  to  Istanbul:  the   threat  to  Western  tolerance  and  Jewish  influence”.   Professor  Morris,  who  grew  up   in  Bondi  and  is  now  a  Fellow  of   the  Foreign  Policy  Institute  at  Johns  Hopkins  University  in  the  US,  described  the  “demographic  timebomb  which  is  Europe”.   As  Europe  ages,  there  is  a  need  to  import  unskilled  labour,  he   said.   While  much  of  the  imported  labour  to  Germany  were  Muslims  from  Turkey,  they  had  assimilat  ed,  he  said;  in  France,  however,  where  the  population  is  now  10  per  cent  Muslim,  “antisemitic  acts  were  largely  done  by  young  Mus   lims  from  Africa”.   The  point  was  picked  up  by  Justice  Einfeld,  who  said  that  ""time  is  not  on  the  side  of  Israel  and  the  Jewish  people.  The  num   ber  of  Muslims  in  the  world  are   growing  far  greater  than  the  rate  of  Jews.”   This  would  translate  to  “increased  influence”  in  the  US,  where  the  Muslim  population   would  soon  exceed  that  of  US  Jews.   Cohen  described  the  “  endless   lies  of  the  Arab  propaganda  machine”  which  are  pushed  by  the  “loony  left  and  rabid  right”  who  have  little  real  understanding  of  the  issues  surrounding  Israel.   “The  time  has  come  when  the   Jewish  community  has  to  say  ‘enough’.   We’ve  got  to  stop  being  nice  to  people.  When  journalists  and  politicians  and  academics  pour  out  this  rubbish,  we’ve  got  to  attack  them.  It’s  no  good  saying  ‘well,  they  are  ignorant  or  stupid’  -  that’s  not  good  enough;  they’ve  got  to  be  hammered  every  time.”   Discussing  the  role  of  the  media,  Barker  said:  “I  find  myself  in  the  role  of  the  Ancient  Mariner  at  the  Wedding  Feast.  It’s  my  intention  to  fix  you  with  a  glitter  ing  eye  and  counsel  not  to  shoot  the  albatross  and  to  beg  you  not  to  shoot  this  old  Goy”.   He  believed  that  such  deeds  as   September  11,  the  Bali  bombing  and  threatening  Jewish  interests  had  in  fact  strengthened  Jewish   existence  and  Western  tolerance. ",2003-12-05

"  NO  REDEEMING  FEATURES   MONSIEUR  Ibrahim  starring  Omar  Sharif  was  screened  at  the  Jewish  film  festival.  It  chronicles  the  life  of  a  Jewish  teenager  named  Moses  who  lives  in  a  Paris  red-light  district  and  shoplifts  to  obtain  money  to  frequent  prostitutes.   Left  parentless,  Moses  moves  in  with  a  kind  Muslim  shopkeeper,  who   converts  him  to  Islam.  This  film  is  well   acted,  the  cinematography  excellent  and  the  connotations  subtle  enough  to  avoid  prosecution  under  race  vilifica   tion  laws.   Its  blatant  message,  though,  is  that  Judaism  is  “cold”,  loveless  and  preoc  cupied  with  money,  while  Islam  is  kind,  generous  and  provides  one  with   ultimate  fulfilment.   I  am  disgusted  that  such  a  film  should  have  been  screened  at  a  “Jew  ish”  film  festival.  No  positive  or  redeeming  features  of  Judaism  were  portrayed.

"  TALK  TO  THEM   THERE  is  a  problem  on  campus  -  unwillingness  to  enter  into  dialogue.  AUJS  is  as  much  to  blame  as  “Islamists”  and  the  radical  left.  Dur   ing  my  three  years  at  Melbourne  University,  I  never  witnessed  posi  tive  action  by  AUJS  to  repair  the  damage  and  heal  the  rifts  between  Jews  and  Muslims.   Their  current  poster  campaign  exemplifies  this  in  stating  “One  global  problem:  Islamist  terrorists”.   Does  this  “promote  the  line  that  Israel  is  really  only  seeking  peace”?  Does  AUJS  really  want  to  alienate  all   Muslim  students  and  create  a   stronger  blockade  to  future  dia  logue?   AUJS  claims  to  be  justified  in  fighting  propaganda;  however,  methods  used  in  its  poster  cam  paigns  are  as  flawed  as  those  of  the   anti-Zionists.   It  is  my  concern  that  its  focus  is  wrong  and  that  its  political  activities  alienate  left-wing  Zionist  students.   AUJS  must  refrain  from  inflam  matory  posters  and  misinformation,  and  concentrate  on  promoting  peace,  understanding  and  accept   ance.   J0ELZYNG1ER   Glen  Iris,  Vic ",2003-06-13
"  Olympic  Games  boycott  threat  over  Israelis   Jean  Cohen   ATHENS  —  Islamic  extremist   groups  have  reportedly  threat  ened  to  bomb  the  2004  Olympic  Games  in  Athens  if  security  is  assigned  to  a  consortium  that  includes  Israeli  companies.   In  addition,  Arab  nations  are  threatening  to  boycott  the  Olympics  if  the  SAIC  Team  gets  the  security  contract  for  the  games,  according  to  the  Greek  newspaper  Avriani.   According  to  Avriani,  a  classi  fied  report  from  Greece’s  govern  ment  security  service  mentions  that  the  possibility  of  using  a  “Jewish  company”  for  security  at  the  games  “will  blow  the  Olympics  into  the  air”.   The  so-called  “Jewish  compa  ny”  —  the  SAIC  Team  —  is  in  fact  an  American  consortium  which  includes  two  Israeli  companies  and  several  Greek  companies.   The  report  says  that  some  SAIC  Team  employees  come  from   the  Israeli  secret  services.   It  also  notes  the  possibility  of  attacks  before  the  games,  as  Muslim  groups  have  reportedly  threatened  a  bombing  blitz  if  a  Jewish  company  receives  the  Olympic  security  contract.

"  Dutch  antisemitism  on  the  rise   RACHEL  LEVY   AMSTERDAM  -  “Fascists  are  Zion   ists,  just  like  Michaone  participant   writes  on  the  Moroccan  website   www.maghreb.nl  -  just  before  Micha,  a  Dutch-bom  Jew  living  in  Israel,  blasts  Israeli  policy.   Anyone  who  frequents  the  site  knows  that  Micha  is  very  often  critical  of  Israeli  policy.  But  attacks  like  the  one  on  Micha  on  the  Moroccan  website  are  commonplace  in  the  virtual  community  of  Moroccans  in  the  Netherlands.   Moroccan  antisemitism  is  on  the  rise  in  Holland.  Dutch  Jews  already  have  known  it  for  several  years:  according  to  the  Centre  for  Informa   tion  and  Documentation  about  Israel  (CIDI),  the  Dutch  equivalent  of  the  Anti-Defamation  League,  the  number  of  anti-Jewish  incidents  has  been  increasing  since  1997.   Since  the  Palestinian  intifada   began  in  September  2000,  however,   the  number  of  incidents  has  increased  and  their  nature  has   changed,  becoming  more  violent  and  physical.   Muslim  immigrants  -  primarily  Moroccan  youths  -  are  responsible  for  the  sharp  rise  in  incidents,  according  to  CIDI.   In  its  2000  annual  report,  Tel  Aviv  University’s  Institute  for  the  Study  of   Antisemitism  and  Racism  reached  a  similar  conclusion:  it  registered  an   increase  of  50  per  cent  in  violent   antisemitic  incidents  in  Western   Europe,  most  of  them  in  countries  with  large  Muslim  communities.   In  cities  like  Amsterdam,  Jews  who  until  recently  walked  freely  with  their  yarmulkes  now  prefer  not  to.  Many  say  they  have  been  subjected  to  name-calling,  physical  attacks  and  aggressive  behaviour  from  Moroc  can  youths.   Tel  Aviv  University's   Institute  for  the  Study  of  Antisemitism  and   Racism  registered  an   increase  of  50  per  cent  in  violent  antisemitic  incidents.   It  began  in  neighbourhoods  such   as  West  Amsterdam  that  are  populated  mainly  by  Moroccan  immigrants.  But  even  in  the  southern  parts  of  Amsterdam,  which  since  World  War  II  have  had  a  large  Jewish  population,  many  Jews  prefer  not  to  walk  outside  with  visible  signs   of  their  faith.   Dutch  society  long  has  ignored  or  downplayed  the  situation.  Common  responses  were  that  the  situation  really  couldn’t  be  as  bad  as  it  seemed,   or  that  Jews  were  too  quick  to  label  all  criticism  of  Israel  as  antisemitism.   In  recent  weeks,  however,  the  tide  seems  to  be  changing.  On  May  4,  the  day  Holland  commemorates  its  soldiers,  Jews  and  other  civilians  who  died  in  World  War  II,  Moroccan   youths  disturbed  various  commem  oration  ceremonies  in  Dutch  cities,  mainly  in  Amsterdam.   It  took  a  week  until  Michel  Rog,  a  local  politician  for  the  centre-left  party  D’66,  filed  an  official  complaint  of  antisemitism  with  Amsterdam  police.   Rog  is  a  member  of  the  neighbourhood  council  in  the  De  Baarsjes  area  of  West  Amsterdam  and  participated  actively  in  the  local  commemoration  ceremony.   “Suddenly  a  group  of  10,  20  young  Moroccans  came  and  began  to  shout  ‘Joden  moeten  we  doden,’”  he  said.  They  repeated  the  slogan,  which  means  “We  should  kill  the  Jews,”  again  and  again.   Similar  incidents  took  place  in  other  Amsterdam  neighbourhoods,  where  Moroccans  disturbed  speech  es  and  the  traditional  two  minutes  of  silence  for  the  dead,  shouting  the  same  slogan  or  “Hamas  Hamas,  put  the  Jews  into  the  gas.”   Elsewhere  in  Amsterdam,  Moroccan  youths  destroyed  flowers  after  the  ceremonies,  set  them  on  fire  or  played  soccer  with  them.

"  NSW  ELECTION  MARCH  22,2003   Working  hard  for  harmony   Premier  Bob  Carr   Photo:  Ingrid  Shakenovsky   AJN  editor  Vic  Aihadeff  interview  Opposition  Leader  John  Brogden   Conflict  In  the  Middle  East  is  invariably  followed  by  expressions  of  hostility  towards  Australia’s  Jewish  and  Muslim  communities.  Why  Is  there  a  dearth  of  condemnation  of  the  attacks  on  the  Jewish  community?   If  the  Jewish  community  comes  to  me  and  says  “these  are  the  attacks,  craft  a  public  statement”,  they’ll  get  an  immediate  and  emphatic   response.   Don’t  forget  my  history  on  this.  I’ve  addressed  rallies  outside  the  Soviet  Consulate  and  Entertainment   Centre,  urging  emigration  for  Soviet  Jewry.  I  did  that  when  I  was  a  young  backbench  politician.   One  of  die  main  reasons  I  swung  Labor  behind  voting  for  a  Royal  Commission  into  the  NSW  Police  Force  in  1994  was  that  I  was  impa  tient  with  their  failure  to  charge  who  ever  was  responsible  for  attacks  on   synagogues.   The  Jewish  community  has  been  supportive  of  all  we’ve  done  to  focus  on  community  relations  in  the  con  text  of  Iraq  and  Bali.  At  every  oppor  tunity  after  September  11  I’ve  tried  to  bring  Christians,  Jews  and  Muslims  together.   I’ve  always  said  the  Jewish  com  munity  only  has  to  ask  for  my  sup  port  and  it  will  get  it  in  the  face  of  prejudice  and  racism.   In  the  aftermath  of  the  1991  Gulf  War,  six  synagogues  were  firebombed.  To  this  day  no  arrests  have  been  made.   As  a  result,  I  persuaded  my  party  to  support  setting  up  a  Royal  Commission  into  NSW  policing.   I  frequendy  reminded  people  that  the  failure  of  the  police  to  make  arrests  in  respect  of  the  synagogue  attacks  was  one  of  the  major  reasons;  I  referred  to  it  in  the  parliament.   Because  of  the  persistence  of  anti  semitism,  the  Jewish  community  is  entided  to  be  anxious,  especially  given  the  rise  of  terrorism.  The  police  are  available  at  any  time  while  I’m  Premier  to  work  with  the  community.   The  community,  particularly  schools  and  synagogues,  have  to  organise  and  pay  for  additional  security  at  great  cost  Is  this  appropriate?   There  is  a  rise  in  private  security  across  society.  More  people  are  employed  in  private  security  than  in  the  police.   Two  men  have  been  convicted  fol   lowing  attacks  on  Jewish  premises  in   late  2000  and  2001.  This  reflected  the  work  of  Strike  Force  Spencerville.   In  a  number  of  interviews  when   I’ve  spoken  about  retaliation  on  Muslim  targets,  I’ve  reminded  the  media  that  Jewish  schools  and  syna  gogues  have  been  the  object  of  attacks  throughout  the  1990s.   The  State  Government  has  Introduced  tough  anti-terror  laws.  What  does  that   3d  Premier  Bob  Carr  and   on  the  eve  of  the  NSW  election.   say  about  the  climate  in  which  we’re  liv  ing?   It  says  we’re  entitled  to  be  appre  hensive.  I’ve  delivered  a  strong  mes  sage  of  reassurance.   When  ASIO  raided  the  homes  of  people  involved  with  lemaah  Islamiyah,  I  supported  them.  As  a  NSW  Labor  Premier,  I  supported  this  Commonwealth  agency.   If  someone  is  associated  with  Jemaah  Islamiyah,  they  deserve  to  be  raided.  You’re  not  entitled  to  belong  to  a  group  that  has  blood  on  its  hands  in  Bali.  You’re  not  entitled  to  belong  to  a  group  that  planned  to  blow  up  the  Australian  High  Commission  in  Singapore.   “TJie  Jewish  community  has  access  to   government.  It  gets  response  from   government.  It  deserves  the  protection  of  government.”   BOB  CARR   Premier   I  hope  the  Jewish  community  appreciates  the  fact  that  I  went  public  forcibly  with  that  strong  anti-terrorist  message.  I  copped  criticism  from  civil  libertarians,  but  didn’t  back  down.   Since  Tampa,  September  11  and  Bali,  and  with  the  complicity  of  talkback  radio,  political  correctness  has  become  a  dirty  word.  Would  you  comment  on  the  height  ened  lack  of  tolerance?   One  of  our  roles  is  to  keep  work  ing  for  community  harmony  during  these  periods  of  stress.  That’s  why  I  pulled  together  leaders  of  all  faiths  for  a  statement  on  tolerance.  That’s  why  I’ve  established  a  community  harmo  ny  group,  with  the  Jewish  communi  ty  represented  on  it.   We  can’t  solve  the  problems  of  the  Middle  East  on  Australian  soil,  but  we  can  remind  people  we  are  a  har  monious  society  and  most  Australians  want  us  to  stay  that  way.   We  can  manage  our  way  through  this  with  forbearance,  restraint  and  a  sense  of  proportion.   Do  you  have  a  position  on  war  on  Iraq?   My  position  is  that  of  Federal   Labor  —  no  Australian  commitment  without  UN  sanction.  I  want  interna  tional  relations  based  on  rules.   I’d  like  to  hear  more  condemna   tion  of  Saddam  Hussein  from  people  opposed  to  war.  I’d  love  to  hear  the  Greens  condemn  Saddam  for  his  extermination  of  the  Marsh  Arabs.   Professor  Bill  Rubinstein  says  that  in  30  yeais,  there  will  be  one  million  Muslims  in  Australia,  which  would  pose  a  threat  to  the   Jewish  community  in  terms  of  lobbying  and  government   I  don’t  think  we  will  see  a  dispro  portionate  increase  in  the  Islamic  community.   I  also  offer  this  reassurance.  The   Australian  way  of  life  is  so  attractive,  it  will  overcome  the  exclusivity  or  separatist  instincts  of  any  group.  I  don’t  just  make  these  remarks  in  respect  of  the  Islamic  community.   All  communities  in  Australia  end   up  being  drawn  to  the  centre  ground,  to  our  democratic,  pluralist  way  of  life.  If  I’m  wrong,  I’d  be  surprised.   The  phrase  “Jewish  lobby”  is  thrown  around  as  a  dirty  word,  is  it?   No.  Everyone  lobbies.  Everyone  has  a  point  of  view.  This  is  a  robust,  pluralist  society.   The  Jewish  community  makes  a  huge  contribution  in  business,  schol  arship,  education,  arts,  philanthropy.  It’s  one  of  our  older,  more  established  communities  with  phenomenal  capacity  for  participation,  but  it  has  access  to  government.   It  has  the  respect  of  government.  It  gets  response  from  government  as  required  and  is  a  community  which  has  faced  monstrous  persecution.  It  deserves  the  protection  of  govern   ment.   I  know  this  community.  I’ve  been  involved  in  it  since  the  1970s,  when  I  set  up  Labor  Friends  of  Israel  in  NSW.  Its  optimal  protection  will  be  through  the  success  of  multicultural  ism.  I’ve  also  got  to  work  to  prevent  the  Islamic  community  drifting  into   isolation.   Opening  the  Art  of  Islam  exhibi  tion  at  the  Art  Gallery  of  NSW,  I  made  a  plea  for  engagement  across  civilisations  and  between  religious  groups.  If  we  get  that  sort  of  exchange  and  tolerance,  the  Jewish  community  will  be  safer.   But  I  say  again,  in  view  of  the  his  tory  of  antisemitism,  the  Jewish  com  munity  is  entitled  to  be  concerned.  It’s  a  community  that  understandably   feels  concerned  at  the  threat  of  terror  ism  and  the  rise  of  fundamentalism.   We’ve  got  to  redouble  our  efforts  to  isolate  extremists  and  to  engage  moderate  Muslims.   I’ve  gone  to  Muslim  gatherings  where  I’ve  applauded  moderate  Muslim  leadership  for  its  explicit   condemnation  of  extremism.   I’d  love  to  see  the  Middle  East  at   peace  so  that  in  Jerusalem  and  Baghdad  and  Damascus  one  could  engage  with  people  of  different  faiths.   Land  Tax?

Roozendaal,  a  former  ALP  NSW  state  secretary,  told  the  Upper  House  that  opponents  of  Ed  Husic  had  used   the  fact  he  was  a  Muslim  to  under   mine  his  campaign  for  the  seat  of  Greenway  in  Sydney’s  northwest.   “The  Labor  Party  does  not  dis  criminate  on  ethnic  or  religious  grounds.  Mr  Husic  s  opponents,  how  ever,  saw  fit  to  use  the  fact  that  he  is  a  Muslim  in  an  attempt  to  discredit  him,”  Roozendaal  told  parliament.   He  said  a  brochure  appeared  the  night  before  the  October  9  poll  “fea  turing  a  fake  ALP  insignia  and  a  pic  ture  of  Mr  Husic,  declaring,  ‘Ed  Husic  is  a  devout  Muslim.  Ed  is  working  hard  to  get  a  better  deal  for  Islam’.  ”   While  conceding  the  electorate’s  changing  demographics  played  a  role  in  the  Liberal  Party  victory,  “it  is  unde  niable  that  Ed  was  also  the  victim  of  a  vicious  and  well-orchestrated  attack  on  his  religion  and  ethnicity”,   Eric  Roozendaal:  “it  is  undeniable  that  Ed  [Music]  was  also  the  victim  of  a   vicious  and  well-orchestrated  attack  on  his  religion  and  ethnicity.”   Roozendaal  said  in  his  speech.   Greenway,  which  until  this  election  had  been  in  the  hands  of  Labor,  is  also  home  to  the  country’s  largest  Pente  costal  Church.  Husic’s  Liberal  oppo  nent,  Louise  Markus,  is  a  member  of  the  church.   “The  beneficiary  of  this  disgraceful  exercise  was  the  Liberal  Party’s  Louise  Markus,  whose  booth  workers  were  overheard  urging  voters  to  support  Mrs  Markus  ‘because  she’s  a  Christ  ian’.  The  Liberal  Party  was  the  direct  beneficiary  of  this  flyer,”  Roozendaal   claimed. ",2004-11-05

"  Curb  Hilaly,  minister  urges  Muslim  leaders   MICHAEL  CAVANAGH.   A  FEDERAL  government  minister  has  called  on  Islamic  leaders  to  assert   their  leadership  in  regard  to  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hilaly  and  not  be  afraid  to  express  their  own  views.   Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  and  Minister  Assisting  the  Prime  Minister  Gary  Hardgrave  believes  Australian   Islamic  leaders  should  “assert”  their  authority  to  ensure  that  members  are  not  “tarnished”  by  extreme  views.   His  remarks  come  as  the  Aus  tralian  Federal  Police  confirmed  that  no  action  would  be  taken  against  the  mufti  over  his  recent  contact  with  Hezbollah  in  Lebanon.   Apart  from  meeting  Sheikh  Hassan  Nasrallah,  spiritual  leader  of  Hezbol  lah,  whose  military  wing  is  banned  in  Australia,  Sheikh  Hilaly  was  reported  as  calling  for  a  jihad  against  Israel  and  praising  September  11.   Hardgrave  has  written  to  Aus  tralian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  (AFIC)  CEO  Amjad  Ali  Mehboob,  asking  that  it  “take  the  lead”  as  repre   sentative  of  Muslims  in  Australia.   “[Hilaly]  is  not  the  person  many  Muslims  would  regard  as  a  leader  of  their  community,”  Hardgrave  told  the   Australian  Jewish  News  .’’It’s  impor  tant  that  AFIC  be  encouraged  to  be  out  there  and  assert  their  authority.”   Sheikh  Hilaly  has  claimed  that  his  remarks  in  Lebanon  were  misquoted,  despite  the  government  arranging  for  a  translation  of  his  speech.   Hardgrave  said  the  sheikh  should  have  corrected  the  error  immediately.  While  people  are  free  to  express  their  views,  there  is  a  need  to  be  aware  of  the  responsibility  this  carries,  he  said.   “There  are  a  lot  of  dynamics  in  the  Muslim  communities  and  a  lot  of  issues  within  parts  of  the  communi  ties.  There  are  a  lot  of  heavy  politics  and  a  struggle  for  leadership  in  some  areas.  I  think  you  are  seeing  it  here.”   Executive  Council  of  Australian   Jewry  president  Jeremy  Jones  said  that  given  that  prior  comments  by  Sheikh  Hilaly,  his  latest  claim  to  have  been  misquoted  should  be  treated  with  scepticism.   “Why  should  we  believe  he  is  any  body  other  than  somebody  who  has,  on  a  number  of  occasions,  made  comments  which  should  not  only  bring  embarrassment  to  himself,  but  to  his  community,  and  fly  in  the  face  of  the  multicultural  tolerant  Australia  which  his  community  and  our   Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hiialy  with  a   photograph  of  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon,  defaced  with  a  Hitler   moustache,  at  a  protest  rally  outside   the  Israeli  Consulate.   community  and  all  decent  Aus   tralians  want  to  build?”   In  1988  Sheikh  Hilaly  accused  Jews  of  being  “the  underlying  cause  of  all   wars  threatening  the  peace  and  securi  ty  of  the  whole  inhabited  earth”  during  a  lecture  at  the  University  of  Sydney.   Hardgrave  said  AFIC  has  worked  liard  to  change  the  face  of  Islam  in  Australia.  “If  the  Muslim  community  are  not  happy  with  what  [Hilaly]  says,  he  has  to  be  told.  AFIC  has  the  power  to  make  these  decisions  and  they  need  to  be  encouraged  to  do  so.   “Sheikh  Hilaly  seems  to  row  against  the  changing  tides  that  these  people  are  trying  to  effect.  It’s  impor  tant  people  realise  the  sheikh  doesn’t  speak  for  everybody”   Australia-Israel  Parliamentary  Friendship  Group  chairman  Chris  Pyne  said  he  has  received  numerous  smails  from  Muslims  upset  by  Hilaly’s  comments.  “He  clearly  is  at  ane  end  of  the  spectrum  of  thought  in  Australian  Islam,”  he  said.   AFIC  CEO  indicated  on  ABC  Radio  that  Sheikh  Hilaly  had  not  helped  his  own  cause.  “He  could  have  used  different  words  to  describe  what  tie  was  trying  to  say,”  Mehboob  said.

"  Muslim  challenge  may  unseat  Sheikh  Hilaly   MELISSA  SINGER   ATTEMPTS  to  unseat  Sheikh  Tajed  din  al-Hilaly,  the  controversial  spiritual   leader  of  Australia’s  Muslim  commu  nity,  are  afoot  following  the  launch  of  a  breakaway  Islamic  council.   The  Islamic  High  Council  of  Aus  tralia  was  formed  in  Sydney  this  month  in  an  apparent  direct  challenge   to  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  (AFIC),  the  official  roof  body  of  Australia’s  400,000  Muslims.   The  new  group  also  plans  to  appoint  its  own  mufti  after  Sheikh  Hilaly  was  criticised  earlier  this  year  for  alleged  antisemitic  outbursts.   Islamic  High  Council  spokesper  son  Mahmoud  Krayem  told  the  Aus  tralian  last  week  that  the  group  aims  to  supersede  AFIC  as  the  community’s  roof  body  by  attracting  factional  Muslim  groups  to  its  ranks.   Its  religious  leader,  Sheikh  Salim  Alwan  al-Hasani,  said  the  council  wanted  to  “provide  sound  guidance  and  immunity  against  extremism”.   But  ARC  president  Dr  Amber  Ali   r   Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly  (right)  with  his  spokesperson  KeysarTrad  in  2003.   denounced  the  group  as  “radical”.   “They  have  a  hidden  agenda;  they  do  not  have  our  support,”  Dr  Ah  told  the  AJN.  “There  is  a  possibility  that  youngsters  may  get  radicalised.”   A  spokesman  for  Sheikh  Hilaly  called  the  new  council  a  “fringe  group”  which  was  “ejected”  from  the  Lakemba  Mosque,  where  Sheikh  Hilaly  is  imam.   “The  bulk  of  the  community  does  not  associate  with  that  group,”  said  Sheikh  Hilaly  s  spokesperson  Keysar  Trad,  refuting  claims  by  the  High  Council  that  it  has  the  support  of  20   Islamic  organisations.   “By  isolating  themselves  further,  they...  are  not  part  of  the  mainstream  [Muslim]  community.”   Trad  said  the  group’s  plan  to  oust  Sheikh  Hilaly  was  “over  ambitious”.   But  Executive  Council  of  Aus   tralian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  president  Jeremy  Jones  welcomed  any  group  which  “denounces  extremism”.   “If  that  is  what  they  turn  out  to  be  then  that  could  be  very  positive,”  Jones  said,  adding  the  ECAJ  would  continue  its  relationship  with  AFIC  despite  objections  to  Sheikh  Hilaly.   During  a  visit  to  Lebanon  in  Febru  ary,  Sheikh  Hilaly  reportedly  called  for  jihad  (holy  war)  against  Israel  and  praised  suicide  bombers.  He  also  met  with  leaders  of  terrorist  group  Hezbol  lah,  which  is  banned  in  Australia.   Said  Jones:  “The  fact  that  he  [Sheikh  Hilaly]  has  any  standing  ...  is   to  the  detriment  ...  of  cultural   harmony  and  dialogue  in  Australia.”   Krayem  declined  to  be  interviewed  by  the  AJN.

"  Muslim  leaders  urged  to  condemn  suicide  bombings   DARREN  LEVIN   AUSTRALIA’S  Muslim  leaders  should  reiterate  their  opposition  to  suicide  bombings,  Sir  James  Gobbo  declared   last  week.   The  former  governor  of  Victoria  and  chair  of  the  Australian  Multicul  tural  Foundation  was  addressing  the  Abraham  Conference  at  the  Australian  Catholic  University  -  an  inter-faith  event  co-organised  by  the  Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victoria.   “A  statement  by  a  national  board  of  imams  who  represent  the  faith  leaders  of  Islam  in  Australia  would  carry  much  weight  and  help  correct  some  misrepresentation  by  those  who  claim  to  speak  as  religious  leaders,”  he  said.   “There  is  the  danger  that  silence  can  be  sometimes  perceived  as  a  form  of  support  for  such  extreme  acts  of   violence.   ‘Those  who  link   deliberate  suicide  to  divine  approval  and  reward  are  distorting   religion,  not  preaching  it.”   SIR  JAMES  GOBBO  Former  governor  of  Victoria   “No  condemnation  of  this  new  evil  can  be  too  strong.  It  is  causing  griev  ous  harm  to  the  true  adherents  of  the  Muslim  faith.”   There  was  “no  room  for  reservation   or  equivocation”  when  denouncing  suicide  bombers,  he  said   Sir  James  also  criticised  those  who  use  religion  to  justify  suicide  bomb  ings.  “Those  who  link  deliberate  sui  cide  to  divine  approval  and  reward  are  distorting  religion,  not  preaching  it,”   he  said.   “It  causes  many  who  are  poorly  informed  about  the  true  nature  of  the  Muslim  faith  to  see  it  being  used  to  jus  tify  the  worst  kind  of  terrorism  in  the  name  of  religion.”   Sir  James  -  who  as  an  Italian  immi  grant  was  the  first  governor  ofVictoria  from  a  non-English-speaking  back  ground  and  the  first  Catholic  governor   -  lauded  Australia’s  multicultural  soci   ety,  but  said  the  “bitter  sectarianism  which  sadly  flourished  in  Australia  right  up  to  almost  the  mid-20th  centu  ry  has  not  entirely  disappeared”.   The  Abraham  Conference  brings  together  members  of  the  Jewish,  Mus  lim  and  Christian  communities  for  workshops  and  lectures.   The  third  conference  of  its  kind,  it  was  co-ordinated  by  the  Australian  Intercultural  Society,  the  Catholic  Inter-faith  Committee  and  the  Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victoria.

"  Making  gentle  inroads  into  Jewish-Muslim  dialogue   BRIDGE-building  between  Sydney*s  Jewish  and  Muslim  communities  is  taking  place  at  various  levels  -  one  of  them  being  through  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel’s  Interfaith  Dia  logue  Group.   The  group  was  set  up  two  years  ago  when  Rabbi  Allison  Conyer  met  Ridhwan  Mariot  at  the  Royal  North  Shore  Hospital’s  Interfaith  Volun  teer  Service.  Both  were  keen  to  talk.   “I  was  cautious  at  first  because  of   political  tensions  in  the  Middle  East,”  Mariot  admits,  “but  I  thought  it  was  worth  giving  it  a  go,  and  I  suggested  to  focus  first  on  spiritual  things  and  stay  away  from  political  issues.”   Rabbi  Conyer  agreed,  with  the  proviso  that  the  group  would  begin  discussing  religious  and  theological  concepts  and  practices,  and  would  broach  the  politics  of  the  Middle  East  only  after  the  group  had  built  up  trust  among  its  participants.   The  meetings  began  with  tenta  tive  exploration  of  specific  religious  topics,  such  as  the  relationship  of  each  faith  to  Abraham,  lifecycle  events  (such  as  birth  and  death),  God,  the  Messiah  and  the  afterlife.   “Dialogue  is  crucial  to  under  standing  between  our  communities,  especially  when  there  is  so  much  strife  in  the  Middle  East,  so  much  confusion  between  the  religious  imperatives  of  our  traditions  and  the  current  political  climate,”  Rabbi  Conyer  said.   Since  those  tentative  beginnings,  50  people  have  met,  either  at  the  tem  ple  or  at  venues  around  Sydney,   Members  of  the  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel  Interfaith  Dialogue  Group  enjoy  a   meal  in  a  succah.   including  the  Auburn  Mosque  and  at  a  family  picnic  at  Bicentenary  Park.   The  most  gratifying  outcome  has  been  the  many  strong  similarities  between  the  traditions  in  belief,  practice,  and  language.   I  “Dialogue  is  crucial  to   promote  understanding   between  our   communities”   RABBI  ALLISON  CONYER  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel   Today,  discussions  drift  freely  into  political  commentary,  with  both  Muslims  and  Jews  feeling  suffi  ciently  comfortable  to  express  their  opinions  and  respect  those  of  oth  ers,  even  if  disagreements  occur.   “It’s  been  interesting  from  both  our  points  of  view  because  it’s  been  good  to  see  what  the  other  thinks,”   Mariot  said.   Rabbi  Conyer:  “So  far  the  group  has  been  very  successful  in  that  it  has  maintained  a  core  group  of  Jews  and  Muslims  each  month,  as  well  as  attracting  newcomers  each  time  .”   The  group  is  considering  ways  of  reaching  a  broader  group  of  Jews  and  Muslims  within  the  greater  Syd  ney  community  to  inspire  others  to  engage  in  interfaith  dialogue.   Rabbi  Conyer  was  recently  invit  ed  to  present  a  workshop  at  the  Community  Harmony  Symposium,  sponsored  by  the  NSW  Community   Relations  Commission.   “It  proved  to  be  a  stimulating  and  productive  exchange  that  iden  tified  impediments  to  dialogue,  examined  ways  to  overcome  them  and  brainstormed  other  models  that  might  be  appropriate,”  Rabbi  Cony   er  said.   “Overall,  this  grassroots  initiative  has  been  a  breath  of  fresh  air  in  a   darkening  political  climate.” ",2004-01-16

"  Canadian  Muslim  leader   preaches  hate  against  Jews   RONITSELA   VANCOUVER  -  The  leader  of  a   mosque  in  Vancouver,  Canada,  has  been  advocating  the  killing  of  Jews.   Sheik  Younus  Kathrada  spoke  of  killing  Jews  soon  after  the  assassina   tion  of  Hamas  leader  Sheikh  Ahmed  Yassin  earlier  this  year.   Kathrada,  who  has  the  reputa  tion  of  being  a  moderate  Muslim  leader,  made  no  secret  of  his  feel  ings,  delivering  his  lectures  openly  at  the  small  mosque,  then  posting  tape  recordings  on  the  Dar  Al-Madinah  Islamic  Society  website.   In  the  speech  he  said:  “We  are  dealing  with  a  people  ...  the  broth  ers  of  the  monkeys  and  the  swine  ...  whose  treachery  is  well  known.  We  should  all  remember  ...  that  these   are  people  who  will  never  keep  their  word,”  he  was  quoted  on  CBS   News  as  saying.   Kathrada  also  said  in  his  sermon  that  the  Koran  views  Jews  as  a  treacherous  people.   “We  hear  Muslims  telling  us  that   we  must  have  love  and  must  live  in   peace  with  these  Jews.  The  reality  is  there  is  never  going  to  be  peace  with  them  [the  Jews].”   Canadian  Jewish  Congress  spokesman  Gerry  Cuttler  said  he  was  dismayed  to  have  learned  that  such  language  and  hatred  was  being  espoused  in  a  Canadian   mosque.   “Our  concern  is  that  Kathrada’s  statements  could  incite  violence   against  Jews.”   Canadian  hate-crime  investiga  tors  and  counterterrorism  forces  are   investigating  Kathrada  over  his   comments.

"  Australian  Muslim  leader  condemns  Israel,  the  West   BERNARD  FREEDMAN  AND  MELISSA  SINGER   AUSTRALIAN  Muslim  leader  Dr  Ameer  Ali,  who  condemned  Israel  as  a  terrorist  state  earlier  this  month,  has  also  condemned  Hamas  and  sui   cide  bombers  after  accusing  the  western  world  of  having  double  standards  about  the  assassinations  of  Palestinian  leaders.   Dr  Ali  was  speaking  following  the  adoption  at  the  Australian  Federa  tion  of  Islamic  Councils  (AFIC)  annual  conference  of  a  resolution   condemning  the  assassinations  of  Hamas  leaders  Sheikh  Ahmed  Yassin  and  Abdul  Aziz  Rantisi.   Dr  Ali,  president  of  AFIC,  accused  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  of  murdering  thousands  of   innocent  Palestinian  civilians.   He  also  condemned  Israel  for   inflaming  the  situation  in  the  Mid  dle  East,  particularly  following  the   assassination  of  Hamas  founder   Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon.   Photo:  Isranet   Sheikh  Ahmad  Yassin  last  month  and  Hamas  leader  Abdel  Aziz  Rantisi  earlier  this  month.   Speaking  on  Radio  National’s  Religion  Report,  Dr  Ali  said  the  con  ference  had  not  passed  any  resolu  tion  condemning  Hamas  and  other  Palestinian  terrorist  groups.   “Why  should  we?”  he  asked.  “The  whole  world  is  backing  double  stan  dards.  They  don’t  condemn  Sharon.   “It’s  a  terrorist  state  that  is  doing  everything.  Nobody  condemns  Israel  and  you  want  us  to  condemn  the  other  side.  Whatever  the  Israeli   says,  he  is  supported  by  the   Americans.”   “We  condemn   everybody,  whereas  the  West  condemns  only  one  side.”   DR  AMEER  ALI   B  ARC  president   Dr  Ali  then  added:  “We  condemn  what  Hamas  has  done,  the  suicide  bombers,  and  what  Israel  has  done.  We  condemn  everybody,  whereas  the  West  condemns  only  one  side.”   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  president  Jeremy  Jones  -  who  attended  a  dinner  held  during  the  AFIC  conference  -  said   Dr  Ali’s  comments  at  the  conference  about  Sharon  and  Israel  were   “regrettable”,  “inaccurate  and  intem  perate”.   “Tremendous  progress  has  been  made  in  Australia  in  Jewish-Muslim  dialogue  and  co-operation  over  recent  years  and,  in  my  experience,  AFIC  leaders  have  generally  sought  rational  and  balanced  discussions  with  Jewish  community  representatives.   “But  the  statement  on  the  death   of  the  terrorist  leader  indicates  the  enormous  gulf  of  misunderstanding  which  we  need  to  address,”  Jones  told  the  AJN.   Following  the  March  assassina  tion  of  Sheikh  Yassin,  Dr  Ali  charged:  “For  too  long  now  the  Israeli  Gov  ernment  and  its  brutal  military  has  subjugated,  terrorised  and  humiliat  ed  the  people  of  Palestine.”   Responding  to  Jones’  criticism,  Dr  Ali  stressed  that  AFIC  does  not  condemn  the  Sharon  Government   any  more  than  it  condemns  the   actions  of  Palestinian  extremists.   “[Sharon  is]  as  guilty  as  Hamas  leaders,”  Dr  Ali  told  the  AJN.  “They’re  both  on  the  same  level.  If  you  condemn  one,  you  condemn  the   other.”   Dr  Ali  added  that  a  solution  to  the  conflict  must  begin  with  the  intervention  of  the  United  Nations  and  a  downgrading  of  the  United  States’  role.  Last  year,  Dr  Ali  criti  cised  the  Howard  Government  for  its  support  of  the  US-led  war  in  Iraq.   “The  US  has  not  been  an  honest  broker,  their  policy  has  been  one  sided,”  he  said.   “We  can’t  afford  to  lose  more  Jews  and  Muslims  in  this  struggle.  We  must  take  the  situation  out  of  the  hands  of  the  US.   “Israel  can’t  go  on  doing  these   underhanded  activities.  We  must   encourage  the  moderates  to  come  out  against  violence.”   To  this  end,  Dr  Ali  praised  the  federation’s  efforts  at  promoting  inter-faith  dialogue,  in  which  he  cited  the  ECAJ  as  a  critical  partner.   The  congress  was  attended  by   around  100  Muslim  leaders  from   Australia,  including  Lakemba  Mosque’s  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly  and  representatives  from  the  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria.

"  Terrorism  likely  to  continue,   Muslim  leader  warns  Australia   VICALHADEFF   ISLAMIC  terrorism  is  likely  to  continue,  unless  its  causes  are  under  stood  and  addressed  by  the  West  and  steps  are  taken  to  “satisfy  the  Muslim  world”,  a  senior  American  Muslim  leader  has  warned  Australia.   “We  have  to  look  at  the  reasons  for   the  frustration  and  hopelessness,”   Imam  Feisal  Abdul  Rauf  said  in   Sydney  this  week.   “There  is  a  need  to  get  to  the  causes  of  what  pushes  people  to  sui  cide.  We  have  to  go  the  causes  of  the  disease  -  politics  and  economics  -  not  the  symptoms”  [suicide  bombers].   “If  we  subscribe  to  the  belief  that  terrorism,  or  militancy,  is  the  result  of  underlying  causes,  the  solution  must  be  to  address  them  and  call  on  those   who  are  in  a  position  to  make  changes.”   Some  grievances  “go  back  to  the  colonial  era  and  the  establishment  of   political  entities”,  he  said.  “It  created  profound  ripple  effects,  including  in   the  nations  of  the  Middle  East.”   He  did  not  mention  Israel  by  name,  but  the  reference  was  apparent.   A  guest  of  the  NSW  Government,  Imam  Feisal  said  there  are  “immediate   ways  of  satisfying  the  Muslim  world”.   “Governments  should  say  ‘Here  is  our  vision  of  how  we  will  deal  with  the  Muslim  world’.  It  will  change  the  tone  of  the  dialogue.   “When  Bush  went  to  Baghdad,  his  speech  was  addressed  primarily  to  US  soldiers;  I  would  have  liked  him  to  have  addressed  the  Muslim  world.   “Just  as  when  Kennedy  went  to  Berlin  and  said  ‘Ich  bin  ein  Berliner]  he   was  saying  ‘Your  cause  is  my  cause’,  the   president  of  the  free  world  should  speak  to  the  Muslim  world  and  say  ‘Your  cause  is  my  cause’  ”   A  second  step  would  be  to  “help  the   economies  of  the  Muslim  world.  The  US  has  made  it  difficult  for  Egyptian  cotton  farmers  and  Pakistan  textile  farmers  to  sell  in  the  US.”   “Just  as  when  Kennedy  said  ‘Ich  bin  ein   Berliner,  he  was  saying  Your  cause  is  my   cause’,  the  president  of  the  free  world  should  speak  to  the  Muslim  world  and  say  Your   cause  is  my  cause'.”   IMAM  FEISAL  ABDUL  RAUF   Imam  Feisal  was  quoted  in  the  Sun  Herald  as  saying  Christians  began  mass  attacks  on  civilians.  “The  Islamic   method  of  waging  war  is  not  to  kill  civilians;  Christians  in  World  War  II  bombed  civilians  in  Dresden  and  Hiroshima,”  he  was  quoted  as  saying.   The  West  and  the  US  must   acknowledge  the  harm  they  had  done  to  Muslims  before  terrorism  could  end,  the  report  said.  There  could  be  little  progress  until  Bush  gave  an  “America  Culpa”  speech  to  the  Muslim  world.   Imam  Feisal  said  condemnation  of  terrorism  by  moderates  “is  important,  but  Muslim  leaders  not  only  have  to  be  true  to  their  principles,  but  must  reflect  the  frustrations  of  their  followers.   There  is  great  frustration  at  the  lack  of  justice.  People  need  to  be  shown  how   Imam  Feisal  Abdul  Rauf...  “Muslim  leaders  must  reflect  the  frustrations  of  their  followers”.   to  behave,  not  how  not  to  behave.   “When  Kennedy  announced  that  the  US  would  put  a  man  on  the  moon  by  the  end  of  the  decade,  it  couldn’t   have  been  done  without  thousands  of  scientists  being  deployed.  In  the  same  way,  to  heal  relations  with  the  Muslim  world  by  the  end  of  this  decade,  thou   sands  of  people  need  to  be  deployed  to  address  a  cluster  of  issues  which  have  fed  the  current  animus”  he  said.   Jewish-Muslim  dialogue  takes  place,  but  it  is  important  “to  make  it  meaningful”  and  to  ensure  that  it  does  not  get  derailed  by  a  suicide  bomber  or  by  the  demolition  of  houses.   1 ",2004-03-26
"  MPs  back  journalist  detained  for  promoting  Jewish-Muslim  ties   MICHAEL  CAVANAGH   AUSTRALIAN  parliamentarians  from  both  sides  of  the  political  divide  have  increased  pressure  on  the  Bangladeshi  Government  over  the  imprisonment  of  one  of  its  citizens  for  “promoting  Islamic-Jewish  dia  logue”.   About  25  members  and  senators  of  Federal  Parliament  have  put  their  names  to  a  letter  to  the  Bangladeshi  High  Commissioner  in  Australia,  seeking  his  intervention  on  behalf  of  Salah  Choudhury.   The  Bangladeshi  journalist,  who  publishes  a  weekly  magazine,  was  detained  in  Dhaka  just  prior  to  leav   Bernie  Ripoll  MP  (left),  who  has  taken   up  the  plight  of  Sala  Choudhury  (right),  who  is  accused  of  spying  for  Israel.   mg  for  Israel,  where  he  was  scheduled   to  address  a  writers  forum  in  Tel  Aviv.   Since  then,  it  has  been  reported  that  he  has  been  interrogated  and  faces  allegations  of  sedition,  which   carry  the  death  penalty.  This  is  despite  no  firm  evidence  being  put  forward  or  charges  being  laid.   Choudhury’s  cause  in  Australia  was  first  taken  up  by  Bernie  Ripoll,   the  Labor  Member  for  the  federal   Queensland  seat  of  Oxley.   Ripoll,  who  says  he  has  had  a  long  interest  in  Middle  East  affairs,  wrote  to  the  Speaker  of  the  Bangladeshi  Parliament,  whom  he  had  met  while  visiting  the  sub-continent.   The  letter  signed  by  the  Aus  tralian  parliamentarians  asks  that  Choudhury  be  released  and  be  allowed  to  continue  promoting   peace.   “The  only  fault  of  Mr  Choudhury   appears  to  have  been  his  attempt  to  promote  Jewish  and  Muslim  discus  sion  and  bridge  an  understanding  between  Islam,  Israel  and  Bangladesh,”  it  states.   “He  has  not  at  any  time  ridiculed  or  shown  contempt  for  his  Islamic  beliefs  and  practice.”   The  letter  was  proposed  by  Labor  Member  Michael  Danby,  who  is  sec  retary  of  the  Australia-Israel  Parlia  mentary  Friendship  Group.   “I  hope  this  will  show  the  High  Commissioner  that  Australians  and  their  representatives  care  about  human  rights,  and  that  promotion  of  Islamic-Israeli  dialogue  is  not  a  crime.  On  the  contrary,  it  should  be  encouraged,”  Danby  commented. ",2004-02-27
"  IN  BRIEF   Noisy  Muslim  kids'  party  blamed  on  Al  Qaeda   AL  Maroush's  seventh  birthday  party  ended  yesterday  when  ASIO  intervened  and  detained  his  family,  after  a  neighbour  believed  it  may  be  related  to  shadowy  international  terrorist  group  Al  Qaeda.

"  Arts&amp;Books   Omar  Sharif  excels  as  Muslim   ‘father’  of  a  Jewish  boy   FILM  REVIEW   MONSIEUR  IBRAHIM   Reviewed  by  Don  Perlgut   FILMS  about  abandoned  teenage  boys  need  to  be  carefully  produced,   otherwise  the  notion  of  abuse  and   neglect  can  become  overwhelming.   Steven  Spielberg’s  Empire  of  the  Sun  and  Paul  and  Chris  Weitz’s  About  a  Boy  (from  the  Nick  Hornby  novel)  both  achieved  this,  but  the  subject  still  is  not  an  easy  one.   The  French  film  Monsieur  Ibrahim  follows  in  their  footsteps  and  will  find  an  audience  because  of  the  appear  ance  of  Omar  Sharif  in  the  title  role.   Sharif  plays  Ibrahim,  an  elderly  Turkish-Muslim  Parisian  shopkeeper  who  befriends  16-year-old  Jewish  Moses  “Momo”  Schmidt.   Egyptian-born  Sharif  starred  in  Lawrence  of  Arabia  and  Dr  Zhivago  and  caused  a  minor  controversy  in  the  Jewish  community  when  he  was  cast  as  the  Jewish  gangster  Nicky  Arn  stein  opposite  Barbra  Streisand  in  Funny  Girl.   Monsieur  Ibrahim  was  directed  and  written  by  Francois  Dupeyeron  from  the  play  of  French-Jewish  writer  Eric-Emmanuel  Schmitt,  and  the  film  feels  like  it  must  come  from  Schmitt’s  own  experience.   It  is  set  in  Paris  around  1960  (with  French  dialogue)  where  we  find  Momo  living  with  his  book-collect  ing,  depressive,  unloving  father  (Gilbert  Melki)  on  Rue  Bleue,  a  street  with  prostitutes,  working-class  Jews  and,  of  course,  Monsieur  Ibrahim.   Momo  has  been  left  so  much  on  his  own  that  when  his  father  finally  abandons  him,  life  does  not  change  very  much.   Momo’s  friends  include  the  local   prostitutes  who  look  out  for  him  in  a  slightly  amused  but  distracted  way;  Myriam  (Lola  Naynmark),  a  Jewish   dancer  who  lives  in  a  flat  below  him;  and,  of  course,  Monsieur  Ibrahim,  who  slowly  befriends  him,  sharing  wisdom,  insights,  warmth  and  support.   Omar  Sharif  befriends  teenager  Momo  in  the  French  film,  monsieur  Ibrahim.   With  the  disappearance  of  his  father,  Momo  turns  to  Ibrahim,  who  responds  in  kind.  This  relationship  -  the  crux  of  the  film  -  is  emotionally  balanced  and  believable,  rarely  over  played  but  consistently  absorbing.   The  key  is  Sharif  -  now  in  his  early  70s  -  whose  character  is  totally  con  vincing  as  the  kindly  Muslim  man  who  chooses  to  assist  the  Jewish  boy.   The  veteran  actor  commands   every  scene  he  is  in,  sometimes  simply   with  a  look.   First-time  film  actor  Pierre   Boulanger  shines  in  the  role  of  Momo,  largely  because  Sharif  gives  him  so  much  depth  to  play  against.   In  other  hands,  Momo’s  coming  of  age  could  have  been  made  melo  dramatic,  but  there  is  a  European  shoulder-shrugging  sensibility  to   this  film  in  its  attitudes  towards  sex  and  loss.   In  the  face  of  increased  anti  semitism  in  France  (from  North  African  Muslims  in  particular),  Mon  sieur  Ibrahim  also  refreshingly  posits  Jewish-Muslim  relations  based  on  friendship  and  trust,  although  there  is  no  Jewish  spirituality  in  Momo’s  life.   The  film  has  some  wonderful  inclusions:  French  and  American   songs  from  the  era,  Monsieur   Ibrahim  and  Momo’s  encounters   with  French  bureaucracy,  and  their  final  journey  together.   This  final  part  of  the  film  did  not  work  so  well  for  me,  but  the  bitter  sweet  ending  is  appropriate.   Monsieur  Ibrahim  is  currently  screening   in  cinemas. ",2004-05-21
"  Iraqi  Muslim  asylum-seeker  Hassan  Sabbagh  with  Judy  McLelland,  who  came  to  his  assistance.   Crossing  boundaries   A  Sydney  Jewish  woman  has   opened  her  heart  -  and  her  home  -  to  an  Iraqi  Muslim  asylum  seeker.  This  story  by  ORYANA  KAUFMAN.   HASSAN  Sabbagh’s  eyes  reflect  untold  hardships  -  the  loss  of  two  sons  to  Saddam  Husseins  regime,  four  years’  incarceration  in  Australian  detention  centres,  fear  for  his  wife  and  five  children  who  are  still  in  Iraq.   A  soft-spoken  Iraqi  Shi’ite  Muslim  who  learned  English  in  detention,  he  published  his  first  work  last  week.   An  anthology  by  30  detainees,  refugees  and  former  asylum-seekers,  Another  Country  was  launched  by  actor  Claudia  Karvan,  having  been  edited  by  Schindler’s  Ark  author  Thomas  Keneally  and  Rosie  Scott,  members  of  PEN  Writers  in  Deten  tion.   Addressing  the  launch,  Karvan  read  an  extract  from  The  Bird,  which  Sab  bagh  wrote  while  in  detention:  “I  am  between  the  razor  wire,  I  hear  nothing  but  the  speech  of  the  guards  and  the  grating  sound  of  gates  being  opened  and  closed,  locked  and  unlocked.  I  can  do  nothing,  be  merciful  with  me...”   In  another  story  Sabbagh  describes  a  garden  he  created  in  Sydney’s  Villawood  Detention  Centre  to  help  retain  his  sanity.   Prior  to  the  first  Gulf  War,  Sabbagh,  59,  was  an  accountant  and  father  of  seven.  After  the  1991  uprising  against  Saddam  failed,  he  was  jailed  and  tor  tured.  Escaping  to  Australia  by  boat  with  145  other  asylum-seekers,  he  was  arrested  and  sent  to  the  Woomera  Detention  Centre  in  South  Australia,  later  relocating  to  Villawood.   Four  years  and  three  months  later,   he  might  still  have  been  behind  razor  wire  were  it  not  for  the  efforts  of  Syd  ney  Jewish  advocate  for  human  rights  and  co-founder  of  Asylum  Seekers  Network  Australia  Judy  McLallen.   Sabbagh  was  released  after  1531  days  and  granted  a  humanitarian  visa.   McLallen  has  given  him  accommo  dation,  and  with  her  husband  Ric  is  helping  him  pick  up  the  pieces  of  his   shattered  life.   WHEN  Saddam  attacked  Karbala  in  1991,  Sabbagh  and  his  family  fled.  “No-one  expected  helicopters  to  shoot  at  us,”  he  said.  “My  eldest  son  was  shot  in  front  of  us.  I  saw  him  fall.”   Sabbagh  was  imprisoned.  He  escaped  a  year  later  and  fled  to  north  ern  Iraq.   “I  was  desperate.  In  two  years  I  had  not  had  a  visitor...  I  thought   about  suicide.  One  day  i  saw  a  lady  waving...  It  was  Judy!’   HASSAN  SABBAGH   Iraqi  asylum-seeker   When  northern  Iraq  also  became  unsafe,  the  family  escaped  to  Syria,  where  they  lived  illegally  for  three  years.  “We  expected  to  be  arrested  at  any  time.  We  kept  hearing  stories  of  people  being  deported  and  executed.”   Sabbagh  says  he  was  unable  to  ask  the  UN  high  commissioner  in  Damas  cus  for  asylum  because  he  had  no  doc  uments  and  Iraqi  agents  were  watching  the  building.  “We  had  to  find  a  country  outside  the  Middle  East.”   To  purchase  passage  to  Australia,  he  sold  his  wife’s  jewellery,  took  loans  and   Hassan  Sabbagh  and  Thomas  Keneally  at  the  launch  of  an  anthology  which  Includes  works  by  Sabbagh.  photo:  Jessica  Hromas   left  his  family  with  enough  money  for   a  few  weeks.

He  also  heard  that  a  second  son  had  been  tor  tured  and  had  died.   He  suffered  a  breakdown  and  became  reclusive.  Moved  to  Villawood,  he  says  he  was  not  offered  any  judicial  process  for  15  months.   “I  was  100  per  cent  mad.  I  had  a  beard  and  sat  on  the  ground  without  speaking.  I  was  desperate.  In  two  years  I  had  not  had  a  visitor,  not  one.   “People  only  wanted  to  talk  about  their  families  and  their  cases.  I  needed  to  see  the  other  side,  to  find  help  in  a  country  where  I  knew  no-one.  I  thought  about  suicide.   “One  day  I  saw  a  lady  waving  for  me  to  come  over  to  her  in  the  visiting  area.  It  was  Judy.  She  asked  why  I  sat  alone  and  invited  me  to  join  them.”   Visiting  an  Afghan  doctor,  McLallen  found  talking  to  Sabbagh  “compelling.  We  talked  about  religion,  history,  literature,  life  in  general.  I  tried  to  take  him  away  from  his  suffering.”   She  also  liaised  with  lawyers  and  doctors  who  later  assisted  him.   Meanwhile,  Sabbagh  created  a  plant  and  vegetable  garden  with  a  table   knife  and  a  bucket  for  a  birdbath.   “Everyone  laughed  at  me  for  mak  ing  a  garden  in  detention.  I  wanted  to  do  something  for  the  country  that  was  hosting  me.  In  the  end  everyone  appreciated  it,  including  manage   ment.”   Sabbagh  now  volunteers  in  com  munity  gardens,  studies  horticulture  and  is  trying  to  reunite  with  his  wife  and  five  surviving  children.

"  Banning  overt   religious  symbols   France  has  banned  the  wearing  of  conspicuous  religious  symbols  in  public  schools,  including  the  kippa,  the  cross  and  the  hijab   (Muslim  head  covering).The  issue  was  recently  explored  by  the  ABC.   ORYANA  KAUFMAN  reports.   IN  a  nation  which  has  fought  hard  for  secularism,  where  does  France  draw  the  line  on  religious  freedom?   Producers  of  ABC’s  Foreign  Corre  spondent  met  in  Sydney  for  a  public  forum  recently  after  screening  two  sto  ries  -  France’s  Identity  Crisis  and  Saudi  Arabia:  Inside  the  cbsed  kingdom.   Reporter  Evan  Williams  said:  “While  the  Star  of  David,  kippa  and  crucifix  are  technically  under  the  ban,  most  people  are  under  no  illusion  of   what  die  fuss  is  about.  It’s  about  iden   tifying  the  minority.  Concerned  about  Muslim  growth,  conservative  politi  cians  are  appealing  to  the  conservative   French.”   While  the  banning  of  conspicuous  religious  symbols  in  public  schools  is  due  to  take  effect  in  September,  a  number  of  Muslim  girls  have  already  been  expelled  from  schools  for  refus  ing  to  take  off  their  hijabs  (head  scarves).   “Teachers  said  secularism  is  threat   ened  by  allowing  girls  to  wear  a  head  scarf  in  school,”  Williams  said.  “The  repercussions  are  that  hundreds  of  girls  who  wear  the  hijab  will  be  expelled.  Muslims  might  feel  more  attracted  to  join  extremist  arms.”   Muslim  Yamin  Makri  told  Foreign  Correspondent  that  it’s  God’s  laws  that   count.  “We  believe  that  even  if  it’s  a   [state]  law,  it  doesn’t  have  legitimacy.”   Opinion  polls  show  70  per  cent  of  French  citizens  support  the  law.  Even  in  France’s  Muslim  community,  Mus  lim  women  favour  a  ban  49  per  cent  to   43  per  cent,  according  to  the  BBC.   Iranian-born  writer  Chadortt  Dja  vann  said  the  scarf  is  regarded  as  “the  symbol  which  authorises  violence  towards  women,  that  defines  women  as  sub-human”.   Williams  also  spoke  to  government  spokesperson  Hanifa  Cherifi,  who  said:  “Contrary  to  French  secularism  and  freedom  of  thinking,  we  cannot  speak  about  liberty  of  thinking  while  wearing  a  headscarf.  It’s  incompatible.”   Describing  the  scarf  as  repressive,  she  said  that  by  banning  it,  the  govern  ment  is  giving  women  the  opportuni  ty  to  break  free  from  their  families.   Reserve  Justice  Howard  Nathan,  a  board  member  of  Australian  Legal  Resources  International  said:  “In  an  Australian  context  the  ban  would  be  intolerable.  We  value  individuals’  right  to  freedom  of  expression,  including  religious  expression,  as  a  core  value.   “In  France  their  core  value  is  secu   larism.  A  person  making  a  religious  expression  in  a  secular  context  offends  French  sensitivities.  The  ban  also  affects  Jews,  Sikhs,  Rastafarians,  Men  nonites  and  other  religious  strands.   “It  damages  Muslim  women  and  will  damage  French  societal  values.  As  a  Muslim  girl  you  are  entitled  to  feel   offended  that  the  state  should  discrim   inate  against  you  and,  as  they  would  see  it,  impede  honouring  God.   “But  the  state  provides  the  funds  [for  education]  and  it  does  so  on  a  basis  of  providing  a  secular  education,  not  a  religious  one.” ",2004-06-04

The  media  is  full  of  “talking  heads”  on  the  subject,  but  many  commentators  are  as  mired  in  ignorance  as  their  subjects.   Finding  a  good  Islam  analyst  is  hard  because  most  haven’t  much  the   oretical  knowledge  of  Muslim  history  or  culture,  or  have  never  lived  inside  the  Muslim  system.   Neither  The  Crisis  of  Islam  nor  The  Trouble  with  Islam  has  those  problems.   Bernard  Lewis,  the  elder  statesman  of  Islamic  historians,  has  forgotten  more  about  Islam,  especially  Sunni  Islam  than  most  people  have  ever   known.   Irshad  Manji,  a  Muslim  journalist,  is  clearly  an  insider  who  wants  to  remain  inside.  Lewis’  book  is  a  little  dry  while  Manji’s  is  extremely  juicy.   ft  Lewis’  book  is  a  fluidly-written,   scholarly  explanation  of  the  contem  porary  challenges  Muslims  face.  His  years  of  work  at  elite  US  universities  show  in  this  intellectual  book,  which  began  as  an  article  in  the  New  Yorker  magazine.   Providing  a  concise  overview  of  Muslim  history,  The  Crisis  of  Islam  traces  the  origins  of  some  of  the  more  troubling  current  trends,  such  as  the  rise  of  die  suicide  terrorist  and  the   general  anarchy  surrounding  the  ,  value  of  human  life  -  both  Muslim   and  non-Muslim.   Especially  helpful  is  his  discussion  of  Wahhabism,  the  ultra-puritanical,  ultra-fanatical  and  obsessive  branch  of  Islam  peculiar  to  Saudi  Arabia,  which  has  now  spread  throughout  the   Muslim  world.   Wahhabism  used  to  be  dismissed   as  a  virtually  harmless  branch  of  Islam,  notable  only  for  its  overly  strict   1  view  of  life.   Now,  as  it  has  spread  beyond  the  borders  of  Saudi  Arabia  (thanks  to  Saudi  emissaries  and  money),  more  and  more  regional  analysts  are  speak  ing  out  about  its  poisonous  nature   and  its  threat  to  the  West.   Lewis’  writings  on  Islam  have  always  been  about  understanding  Islam  as  an  academic  discipline  and  exploring  it  as  an  intellectual  enter  prise.  He  maintains  a  professional  distance  from  the  subject  and  some  times  shows  traces  of  disdain  for  it.   Manji’s  book  is  an  impassioned  letter  to  the  faithful  as  to  why  there  should  be  a  reform  movement  in  Islam  -  and  soon.   Manji  wants  to  stay  a  Muslim:  she  wants  not  to  be  forced  out  by  bigots  and  misogynists.  She  loves  Islam  and   wants-  to  see  tolerance  flourish  in  Islam  and  directly  advocates  why  and  how  this  can  happen.   Here  is  a  Muslim  who  is  thinking  along  lines  we  can  ail  understand.   It  is  an  easy  read,  engaging  and  urgent.  Its  urgency  is  exciting:  here  is  a  Muslim  who  is  thinking  along  lines  we  can  all  understand.   The  drawback  is  serious:  the  author  is  a  western-educated,  west  ern-residing  lesbian,  not  likely  to  be  taken  seriously  by  anybody  in  charge  of  the  Muslim  schools  of  thought.   Because  of  who  she  is,  every  fact  and  word  (no  matter  how  valuable  or  logical)  she  writes  will  be  dis   missed.   Obviously,  that  is  unfortunate.  Many  of  the  details  she  calls  on  in  the  case  of  the  conflicts  surrounding  Israel,  while  familiar  reading  for  the  Jewish  community,  would  be  revela  tory  to  a  Muslim  reading  this  book  with  an  open  mind.   Her  research  is  outstandingly  thorough:  she  does  not  flinch  before  unpleasant  news  about  the  Muslims.

"  SYDNEY   WEEK  IN  THE  COMMUNITY   The  universal  language   .Music:   What  can  be  achieved  when   you  cross  a  Muslim  Indonesian  percussionist,  two  Christian   performers  from  New  Zealand   and  a  melodious  Jewish  couple?  A  musical  extravaganza  that  crosses  cultural  boundries  to  find  ""Common  Ground"".   ORYANA  KAUFMAN  reports.   MUSIC,  it  is  said,  has  the   power  to  cross  cultural  barriers  and  communi  cate  without  words.   And  Sydney  musician  Judy  Campbell  understands  the  power  of  music  as  well  as  anybody.   A  singer-songwriter  and  direc  tor  of  the  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel  choir,  Campbell  together  with  saxophonist  husband  Mark  Ginsburg  formed  world-music  jazz  band  Mosaic  as  a  ""model  for  unity  in  diversity"".  The  group  also  com  prises  guitarist  James  Muller,  per  cussionist  Nicholas  McBride,  vocalist  Justine  Bradley,  Gerard  Masters  on  piano  and  bassist  Brett  Hirst.   This  month  Mosaic  launches  their  debut  CD,  Common  Ground,  following  their  return  from  a   three-week  South  African  tour,  performing  at  the  ""Viva  Madiba""   celebration  of  Nelson  Mandela's  86th  birthday  in  Cape  Town  and  at  the  National  Arts  Festival,  where  they  played  with  an  Indigenous  African  choir.   ""It's  about  drawing  disparate  information  together  into  some  thing  greater  than  the  sum  of  all  parts  and  achieving  that  in  a  space  called  common  ground,""  says  Campbell,  46.   Having  emigrated  from  Cape  Town  to  Sydney  in  1982,  Campbell  says  the  trip  has  rein  forced  her  connection  with  Africa.  Adorned  in  bright  beads  and  African  plaits,  she  sported  a  new  look  to  prove  her  point.   A  highlight  of  the  trip,  says  Campbell,  was  being  able  to  mix   musicians  and  styles  and  find  the  ""common  ground""  she  speaks  of.   ""We  invited  young  South  African  musicians  to  perform  at  the  jazz  and  blues  festival.  Some  of  them  hadn't  played  with  foreigners  before.""   For  Campbell  it  was  a  fine  line  between  ""trying  to  facilitate  a  collective  experience  and  coming  across  as  patronising.   ""You  see  the  village  where  they  come  from  and  then  you  pick  them  up  and  put  them  in  a  glam  orous  club  with  cocktails  and  money  floating  around.  You  have  to  be  sensitive  about  how  you  do   it.   ""But  they  had  a  great  time.  One  14-year-old  boy  from  the  township  of  Langa  [on  the  out  skirts  of  Cape  Town]  was  offered  a   permanent  position  in  a  band.""   Together  with  American  com  poser  Shelley  Olson,  Campbell  co  produced  the  CD  A  Chanuka  Cantata,  dedicated  to  peace  in  Jerusalem  and  around  the  world.  It  led  to  an  invitation  to  perform  at  the  White  House  in  2000.   Next  week,  four  members  of  Mosaic  will  be  joined  by  Muslim  Indonesian  percussionist  Deva  Permana,  for  a  performance  at  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel  called  ""Musicians  speak  their   minds"".   The  event  is  designed  to  bring  together  different  musical,  nation  al  and  ethnic  traditions.   Permana,  31,  from  Java,  will  play  a  traditional  drum  called  a  kendang.   CONTINUED  UFE  4   Music:  the   universal  language   CONTINUED  FROM  UFE1   ""Not  many  Indonesian  artists  or  musicians  have  the  chance  to  play  their  music  and  mix  with  other  kinds  of  Australian  music.  They  are  often  limited  to  only  playing  within  their  community,""  he  says.   ""It's  not  because  they  don't  want  to  mix.  It's  often  because  they  don't  have  the  chance,  or  they  have  the  belief  that  Indonesian  and  western  music  can't  work  together.""   At  the  NSTE  function,  says  Campbell,  ""We  will  be  talking   about  how  we  feel"".   ""Music  acts  as  a  unifying  force  and  it  is  a  good  model  for  unity  and  diversity.  In  our  days,  when  peace  and  harmony  seem  to  be  increasingly  elusive  commodities,  musicians  of  conscience  are  pooling  their  talents  to  promote  peace  and  harmony.""

Photo:  AP/AAP   &amp;  riLiflCAL  BOYCOTTS   ATHENS  2004   For  Israeli  sportsmen,  boycotts  by  Muslim  athletes  are  nothing  new,  reports  DINA  KRAFT.   8  The  first  time  Israel  was   I  I  involved  in  a  political   |  I  boycott  was  in  1956.  |  1  Several  countries,  I  I  including  Syria,   |  I  Lebanon  and  Egypt,   I  I  boycotted  the  Olympic  1  I  Games  in  Melbourne  I  I  that  year  after  Israel  1  1  invaded  Sinai.   THE  refusal  by  Iran’s  world   judo  champion  to  compete  against  Israelis  in  Athens  is  part  of  the  Jewish  State’s  long  tangle  with  political  hostility  on  the  playing  field.   In  ancient  times,  the  period  of  the  Olympic  Games  was  a  time  when  enemies  laid  down  their  arms  and  chose  sportsmanship  over  war.   “If  you  are  looking  at  the  Olympic  ideals,”  said  Yair  Galily,  a  sports  sociol  ogist  at  the  Wingate  Institute,  Israel’s  national  sports  centre,  “the  Iranian  action  in  some  ways  is  a  disgrace  to  the  spirit  of  the  Olympics”.   The  first  time  Israel  was  involved  in  a  political  boycott  was  in  1956.  Sev  eral  countries,  including  Syria,  Lebanon  and  Egypt,  boycotted  the  Olympic  Games  in  Melbourne  that  year  after  Israel  invaded  Sinai.   Israeli  judoka  Arik  Ze’evi   holds  his  bronze  medal  upon  his  return  to  Israel   this  week.  He  became  the  fifth  Israeli  to  win  an   Olympic  medal.  Photo:  Isranet   More  recently,  security  concerns  rather  than  outright  politics  have  badgered  Israeli  sports.  No  interna  tional  soccer  matches  have  been  held  in  Israel  for  the  past  five  years.  Dur  ing  the  European  League  basketball  championships  this  year,  there  was  some  talk  that  the  finals  would  not  be  held  in  Tel  Aviv  as  scheduled  because  of  concerns  over  terrorism  -  although,  in  the  end,  Tel  Aviv  not  only  hosted  the  finals  but  won  the  championship.   After  decades  of  being  regionally  homeless  on  the  sports  field  because  Asian  and  Middle  Eastern  regional  sports  bodies  refused  to  include  Israel,  the  Jewish  State  was  accepted  in  European  soccer  and  basketball  leagues  -  as  well  as  other  sports  like  track  and  field  -  in  the  early  1990s,  Galily  said.   Indonesia  was  banned  from  play  ing  at  the  1964  Olympics  in  Tokyo  for  not  inviting  Israel  to  the  Asia  Games  the  year  before.  The  last  time  Israel  was  invited  to  the  Asia  Games,  held  every  four  years,  was  in  1976  when  the  event  was  hosted  in  Teheran  -  before  the  Islamic  revolution.   Israel  already  had  been  kicked  out  of  other  Asian  sports  federations  by  1973,  following  the  Yom  Kippur  War.   In  the  years  following,  Israel  had  to  travel  all  the  way  to  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  Fiji  to  find  willing  competitors.   The  reason  there  are  not  more  flaps  between  Israeli  athletes  and  their  counterparts  from  Arab  or  Muslim  countries  is  that  they  so  rarely  com  pete  in  the  same  arenas.  It’s  only  in   world  gatherings  like  the  Olympics  or  world  championships  that  their  paths   cross.   “It’s  a  matter  of  luck,  coincidence,  and  the  fact  that  there  are  not  a  lot  of  competitions  where  Arabs  and  Israelis  meet,”  said  Haggai  Harif,  who  teaches  a  popular  course  on  sports  and  politics  at  Bar  Ilan  University.   This  was  not  the  case  before  the  establishment  of  the  State  of  Israel  in  1948,  Harif  said.   Until  the  mid-1940s,  Palestinian  teams  in  the  British  Mandate  era  were   made  up  mostly  of  Jews  and  met  teams  from  local  Arab  countries  in  competition  in  sports  such  as  soccer,  water  polo  and  track  and  field.  But  once  regional  tensions  rose  ahead  of  Israel’s  1948  War  of  Independence,  the  competitions  ended.   Even  since  Israel  signed  peace  treaties  with  Jordan  and  Egypt,  sports  competition  with  those  countries  has  been  limited.   One  exception  was  a  handball  game  in  the  early  1990s  when  the  Israeli  national  team  went  to  play  in  Egypt.  The  Egyptians  apparently  took  their  political  aggression  out  on  the  field,  playing  an  especially  violent  game  which  left  several  of  the  Israeli  players  injured  and  bruised.   “One  came  back  with  a  broken  nose,”  Harif  said.  There  also  was  a  friendly  soccer  match  between  Jordan  and  Israel  in  the  mid-1990s  back   when  hopes  were  high  for  Middle  East  peace.   “But  since  this  most  recent  intifa  da  there  has  been  nothing  to  speak   of,”  Harif  said.

"  WHY  THE  SURPRISE?   MARK  Lathams  comment  on  the   Beslan  tragedy  asked  “what  sort  of  people  target  children?”   Muslim  extremists  have  been   killing  Israeli  women  and  children  for  over  100  years,  so  why  the  surprise?   They  did  it  in  Beersheva  two  weeks  ago,  but  the  disgust  rightly  shown  by  the  world  at  the  Russian  tragedy  was  not  exactly  evident  over  that  tragedy.   No  condemnation  by  the  Security  Council.  Why  not?  The  tragedy  in  Russia  is  the  same  as  that  in  Bali,  9/11,  Israel  and  even  Iraq.  Same  perpetra  tors,  same  motivation  -  destroy  the  West,  achieve  world  domination.   Perhaps  if  there  was  complete  con  demnation  of  Arafat  and  his  Palestin  ian  Authority,  with  withholding  of  all  funds  (including  those  of  the  UN,  to  which  we  contribute)  to  his  corrupt  administration,  the  “Middle  East  problem”  would  long  since  have  been   settled.

"  Mahathir  urges  talk,  not  terror   GUY  SHARETT   KUALA  LUMPUR  -  Former   Malaysian  prime  minister  Mahathir  Mohamad  may  think  the  Muslim  world  should  unite  to  defeat  the  Jews,  but  that  doesn’t  mean  Palestinians  killing  Israelis  is  the  way  to  solve  the  problems  of  the  Middle  East.   Several  months  after  Mahathir   gained  international  headlines  by  say  ing  “Jews  rule  the  world  by  proxy”  and   the  Muslim  world  should  unite  to  defeat  them,  he  agreed  to  sit  down  with  an  Israeli  journalist  to  clarify  his  views.   In  the  unusual  interview,  Mahathir  said  he  doesn’t  think  that   Palestinian  suicide  bombings  “solve  any  problem”.   “It  is  far  better  for  them  to  sit  down  and  think,”  Mahathir  said.  “It  is  a  question  of  revenge.  Because  you  kill  my  people,  I  will  kill  your  people,  and  because  your  people  are  killed,  you  kill  my  people.  And  it  keeps  on  going  like  that.”   But  Mahathir  still  had  plenty  of   criticism  for  the  Israelis.  “Israel  is  not   a  friendly  country  and  we  shouldn’t  do  business  with  Israel,”  he  said.   Mahathir  also  called  Israel’s  killing  of  Hamas  founder  Sheik  Ahmed  Yassin  “an  act  of  terror”.   Mahathir  used  the  interview   opportunity  to  dispute  his  being   labelled  as  antisemitic.   His  seemingly  anti-Jewish  com  ments  made  at  last  year’s  meeting  of   The  front  page  of  the  AIN  of  October  24,   2003.   the  Organisation  of  Islamic  Countries   caused  an  international  stir.   They  were  made  just  before  Mahathir  retired  after  22  years  as  the  leader  of  Malaysia,  a  predominantly  Muslim  country.   “They  must  never  think  they  are  the  chosen  people  who  cannot  be  criticised  at  all,”  Mahathir  said  of  the  Jews.   In  the  interview  with  Israel’s  Channel  10  TV  station,  Mahathir  said:  “I  feel  that  I  have  a  right  to  explain  myself  to  the  world  and  to  the  Israelis  because  I  find  myself  being  misinterpreted  all  the  time,  labelled  as   anti-Jew.   “When  we  talk  about  the  Jews,  principally  we  think  of  those  Jews  who  are  very  supportive  of  Israeli  intransigence,  not  all  Jews.  Because  we  know  there  are  Jews  living  in  Mus  lim  countries  -  even  in  Iran  they  still  have  Jews.  These  people  are  not  sup   porting  the  kind  of  attacks  mounted  by  Israelis.”   Mahathir  said  Israel  should  not  use  the  Holocaust  as  an  excuse  for  aggression  against  others.   “You  cannot  use  that  as  an  excuse   to  attack  other  people  or  to  kill  other  people  or  that  people  should  not  crit  icise  Israel  simply  because  in  the  past   there  had  been  this  Holocaust.”   When  asked  about  trade  between   Malaysia  and  Israel,  which  according  to  Israel  amounted  to  $300  million  during  2003,  Mahathir  said:  “We  don’t  trade  directly  with  Israel.  We  export  a  lot  of  our  products  to  Singa  pore  and  Singapore  then  sells  these  products  to  other  countries.  In  our  figures  of  trade  there  is  not  a  single  dollar  that  is  coming  from  trade  with   Israel.”   Malaysia  and  Israel  do  not  have  diplomatic  ties.  But  Mahathir  said  that  establishing  relations  between  the  two  countries  would  be  possible  once  Israel  resolves  its  problem  with   the  Palestinians.   “Malaysia  is  a  trading  nation  and  we  are  always  looking  for  markets.  Israel  has  got  a  lot  of  knowledge  in  technology  and  agriculture,”  he  said.   At  the  end  of  the  interview,  Mahathir  said:  “We  wish  the  Israeli  people  and  the  Jewish  people  peace,  hopefully  in  their  lifetime,  but  to  have  peace  they  should  also  think  of  the  other  people’s  problems,  not  only   their  own.’   JTA ",2004-04-30

"  Cairo  imam  asks  God  to   ‘strike  the  Jews’   CAIRO  -  Thousands  of  Muslim  worshippers  across  the  Middle  East  last  Friday  demanded  revenge  for  the  assassination  of   Hamas  leader  Sheikh  Ahmed  Yassin  and  denounced  America  for  backing  Israel.   At  prayer  services  from  Iran  to  ^  Bahrain,  protesters  carried  Pales  tinian  flags  to  commemorate  Yassin  -  who  was  killed  last  week  -  and  shouted  angry  slogans  against  “the  Zionist  enemy”.

Teens  wore  green  bandanas  bearing  messages  that  read  “All  of  us  are  Yassin”  in  Arabic  and  English.   Banners  were  hung  around  the  mosque  praising  Yassin  and  promising  to  seek  revenge  for  his  death.  Leaflets  bearing  his  picture  were  handed  out,  reading  “We  are  not  afraid  of  death,  for  it  is  life”.   Thousands  of  men  and   women  then  spilled  out  of  the  mosque,  shouting  “we  will  fight”  and  “a  salute  to  jihad!”   Police  and  soldiers  surrounded  the  area  and  closed  off  roads  lead  ing  to  the  mosque.

"  Sack  Hilaly,  says  journalist   ALANA  ROSENBAUM   HARD-HITTING  columnist  Andrew  Bolt  has  delivered  a  scathing  attack  on  Australia’s  Muslim  leadership  over  its  continued  support  of  Sheikh  Tajed  din  al-Hilaly  -  Australia’s  Islamic  reli  gious  leader  who  has  pilloried  Jews  and  been  filmed  praising  suicide   bombers.   “Get  rid  of  him  or  resign”  was  Bolt’s  blunt  message  to  Yasser  Soli  man,  president  of  the  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria,  during  an  at-times  heated   debate  at  Limmud  Oz  in  Melbourne.   The  Herald  Sun  writer  said  Mus  lim  leaders  should  cease  making  excuses  for  Sheikh  Hilaly  and  disown   him.   “They  are  responsible  for  produc  ing  Islamophobia,  not  the  ones  who  report  on  their  doings,”  he  said,  allud  ing  to  claims  that  Australian  media  promote  hostility  against  Muslims.   Soliman  defended  the  endorse  ment  of  Sheikh  Hilaly  by  the  Aus  tralian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  as  grand  mufti,  saying  he  does  not  speak  for  all  Muslims.

The  image  of  Sheikh  Tajeddin  being  a  [Ayatollah]  Khomeini  figure  is  rubbish,”  he  said.   Also  defending  Sheikh  Hilaly,  Kuranda  Seyit  of  the  Forum  on  Aus  tralia’s  Islamic  Relations  denied  that  the  sheikh  supports  terrorism.  Sheikh  Hilaly  is  frequently  quoted  out  of  con  text  or  misquoted  because  he  does  not  speak  fluent  English,  he  said,  adding   that  the  sheikh  is  not  antisemitic.   Bolt  responded  that  “Sheikh  Hilaly  has  a  remarkable  history  of  people  making  excuses  for  him  and  legitimis  ing  him”.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman  said  the  sheikh’s  remarks  were  the  antithesis  of  multiculturalism.  He  did  not  resile  from  signing  a  statement  with  the  sheikh,  Keysar  Trad  and  Rabbi  Ray  mond  Apple  in  2002,  calling  for  peace.   Sheikh  Hilaly’s  contentious  history  dates  back  to  1988,  when  he  described  Jews  as  “the  underlying  cause  of  all  wars  threatening  the...  earth”. ",2004-06-18
"  Jews,  Muslims  offer  hope  through  harmony   JACQUIGAL   HOPING  to  harness  the  healing  power  of  music,  Israeli-born  Nurit  Ophir  has  brought  together  Jewish  and  Muslim  musicians.   Entitled  ""Matrouz"",  a  Judeo-Arab  word  meaning  ""embroidered  poet  ry"",  the  group  hopes  to  inspire  ""har  mony  and  peace"".  Jewish  musicians  Heather  Lee,  Kim  Cunio  and  Mark  Isaacs  will  perform  with  Muslims  Aysha  Goknur  Shanal,  Hassan  Goskel  Shanal,  narrator  Kuranda  Seyfi  Seyit  and  Kurdish  Iranian  musician  Jamal  Rekabi  this  Saturday  night.   Studying  music  therapy  at  the  University  of  Technology  Sydney  (UTS)  Ophir  was  required  to  create  an  event  in  the  community  that  would  enhance  relationships  through  music.  She  decided  to  focus  on  the  strained  relationship  of  the  Mid-East.  ""I've  been  concerned  about  the  conflict  in  the  Middle  East,""  she  told  the  AJN.   ""I'm  married  to  a  non-Jewish   man,  I  live  in  a  multicultural  society  and  it's  important  to  find  a  bridge  between  cultures,""  said  Ophir,  42,  who  has  lived  in  Australia  since  1989.   Originally  hoping  to  contact  Palestinian  musicians,  Ophir  encoun  tered  difficulties  after  approaching  a  member  of  the  local  community.  ""It  was  a  bad  time.  I  spoke  to  him  just  after  the  assassination  of  Sheikh  [Ahmed]  Yassin.   ""There  was  a  lot  of  hurt  and  anger.  They  couldn't  move  beyond  it.  It  would  be  good  for  the  future,  but  not   now.""   Instead   Ophir  found  musicians   from  Middle  Eastern   backgrounds,   meeting  with   Music  therapist  Nurit  Ophin  “I  wanted  to   celebrate  what  unites  us  rather  than  what  divides  us.  I  wanted  to  celebrate  our  music.”   them  for  five  rehearsals  over  a  six  month  period.   With  diverse  musical  interests  -  from  classical  to  jazz  and  world  music  -  Matrouz  performs  lullabies  in  Arabic  and  Hebrew,  Iraqi  and  Turkish  folkloric  songs  and  improvisations.   ""I  wanted  to  celebrate  what  unites  us  rather  than  what  divides  us.  I  wanted  to  celebrate  our  music.   ""Music  is  not  only  for  entertain  ment,  but  a  connection  tool.  My  goal  is  to  make  people  think  of  music  on  a  deeper  level.""   Proceeds  from  the  performance  will  be  donated  to  the  Australian  Refugee  Association.

The  Muslim  cleric,  who  was  once  accused  by  the  Prime  Minister  of  condoning  terror,  has  outraged  Hezbollah  officials  with  his  recent  calls  for  reconciliation.  ""We  take  our  eyes  off  him  for  a  second  and  he's   furtively  slinking  back  home  to  promote  peace,""  said  Hezbollah  leader  Sheik  Nasrallah.  ""There  is  simply  no  excuse  for  such  deeply  non-  divisive  language  at  a  time  like  this.""  But  al-Hilaly  has  defended  himself,  noting  that  he  was  speaking  in  ""an  unpoetic  Australian  fashion,""  in  which  phrases  like  ""terrorism  is  an  act  of  stupidity,  recklessness  and  madness""  can  easily  be  mistranslated  from  ""we  will  jihad  until  every  day  is  September  11"".

"  Osama   Directed  by  Siddiq  Barmak  LB  Jeffries  saw  Osama  at  Electric  Shadows  in  Civic   Osama  is  the  first  film  to  have  been  made  post  Taliban  in  Afghanistan.  The  small  body  of  work  produced  by  the  Afghani  film  industry  before  that  Muslim  extremist  movement  came  to  power  was  destroyed  during  the  Taliban's  reign,  and  so  Osama  appears  to  be  the  only  film  of  its  type  in  existence.  Its  appearance  on  the  world  film  scene  has  been  widely  greeted  with  commendation,  but  it's  easy  to  concentrate  too  much  on  how  'important'  a  film  is  (and  this  one  is  given  its  subject  matter)  and  ignore  its  quality,  or  lack  of,  as  a  work  of  cinema.  Part  of  making  a  great  movie  is,  after  all,  making  it  good  to  watch.  Osama  is  a  difficult  film  to  watch,  but  in  the  end  I  think  very  worthwhile.  Worthwhile  because  it   takes  us  into  the  complexities  and  everyday  experience  of  a  world  that  the  news  could  never  hope  to  capture.  The  film  begins  with  a  march  through  the  streets  of  an  anonymous  Afghani  town,  completely  veiled  women  protest  at  not  being  allowed  to  work,  and  earn  money  to  live,  under  the  Taliban's  laws.  It  doesn't  last  long,  the  trademark  4WD  utes  laden  with  armed  Taliban  fighters  arrive  and  turn  on  the  women  with  their  firearms.  Desperate  for  income,  a  mother  sends  out  her  young  daughter  into  the  town  ship  dressed  as  a  boy  to  gain  work  and  earn  money  to  keep  the  family  alive.  She  uses  the  appropriately  patriotic  name  of  Osama  to  deflect  suspicion.  The  film  is  about  her  journey  into  the  world  of  men,  or  more  accurately,  young  boys  being  taught  how  to  be  men  in  a  country  under  the  tight  control  of  a  radical  religious  movement.  It's  an  effort  to  watch  at  times  due  to  the  slow  pace,  but  probably  necessary  to   realist  feet.  Director  Siddiq  Barmak  definitely  has  a  lot  of  room  to  improve  on  his  technique  as  a  filmmaker,  but  Osama  is  still  undoubtedly  a  film  worth  seeing. ",2004-05-31

"  A  tale  of  interfaith  dialogue  in  two  cities   VIEWPOINT   PETA  JONES  PELLACH   Interfaith  dialogue  is  just  one  means  of  creating  greater  understanding,  but  it  is  possibly  the  most  potent   THE  concept  of  the  common   “Abrahamic”  heritage  of  Chris  tians,  Muslims  and  Jews  may  be  more  important  to  promote  in  Aus  tralia  today  than  at  any  time  past.   As  the  Muslim  population  grows   in  influence  at  the  same  time  as  mis   trust  of  Muslims  among  Christians  reaches  a  zenith,  the  interests  of  the  Jewish  community  lie  in  communica  tion  and  co-operation  with  moderate  sections  of  that  community.   As  the  influence  of  Mel  Gibson  and  other  fundamentalist  Christians  pene  trates  secular  Australian  suburbia,  we  need  strong  bonds  with  those  in  the  Christian  world  who  respect  our  tra   dition  and  value  our  differences.   I  have  been  involved  in  interfaith  dialogue  conducted  under  the  aus  pices  of  the  Executive  Council  of  Aus  tralian  Jewry,  forging  links  with  churches  and  Muslim  organisations.   It  is  not  always  easy.  Consider  the  question  of  “Covenant”.   Considering  that  Christians  have  a  different  take  and  that  Muslims  use   different  terminology  for  their  rela  tionship  with  the  Divine,  and  acknowledging  that  there  is  diver  gence  within  Jewish  thought,  suggest  ing  there  is  a  Jewish  understanding  of  “Covenant”  may  be  disingenuous.  That  is  the  type  of  discussion  inter  faith  dialogue  demands.   We  also  participate  in  responses  to  political  or  social  issues.  While  we  are   happy  to  condemn  injustice,  it  can  become  sticky  if  the  intention  is  to  vilify  Israel.   When  it  comes  to  matters  of  bioethics,  it  is  not  unusual  to  find  that  the  intention  is  to  present  the  faith  groups  as  united  in  a  conservative  position  which  in  no  way  resembles  the  complexity  of  the  Jewish  approach.   Despite  the  problems,  the  benefits  of  dialogue  outweigh  the  difficulties.   The  opportunity  to  participate  in  two  interfaith  conferences  in  succes  sive  weeks  presented  itself  when  the  Jewish  communities  of  Melbourne  and  Sydney  respectively  joined  Mus  lim  and  Christian  groups  to  host  scholars  in  an  exploration  of  our  heritage  as  “Children  of  Abraham”.   The  first,  in  Melbourne,  was  billed  as  “International  Inter-Religion:  Abra  ham  Conference”.  Dr  Devorah  Weiss  man,  The  Shalom  Institutes  scholar-in-residence,  featured  in  the  opening  panel.  Kosher  food  was  pro  vided.  Topics  were  crafted  to  avoid  offence.  The  feeling  was  one  of  joint  ownership  and  shared  legitimacy.   It  was  interesting  to  compare  the  Muslim  participants  in  Melbourne  with  the  Islamic  community  with  whom  we  work  in  Sydney.   Melbourne’s  Muslims  appeared  to  be  less  confident.  There  seemed  to  be  more  first-generation  Australians  and  few  from  outside  the  friendly  Turkish  community.  Even  my  controversial   topic  of  “Zionism”  drew  no  observ  able  hostility  and  elicited  interest.   The  Turkish-Muslim  organisation  Affinity  is  committed  to  interfaith  dia  logue.  As  the  sponsors  of  the  Sydney  conference,  they  were  interested  in  learning  the  Jewish  perspective  about  issues.  In  Sydney  the  Muslim  contin  gent  was  bolstered  by  second-genera   tion  Australians  and  a  number  from   Arab  countries.  Their  questions  were  more  aggressive,  although  no-one  deviated  from  respectful  interaction.   In  Sydney  there  was  less  considera  tion  for  the  Jewish  perspective  or  cul  tural  needs.  There  was  no  kosher  food.   The  topic  “Zionism”  was  listed  alongside  “Jihad”  and  “Crusades”  on  the  program  -  creating  the  impression  that  the  topics  were  linked  and  that  this,  too,  was  an  attempt  to  dominate   “non-believers”.   There  was  a  smaller  Jewish  contin  gent  than  in  Melbourne,  where  it  was  empowering  to  represent  the  Jewish  community.   Although  we  are  perceived  as  pow  erful  by  Christians  and  Muslims  in  both  cities,  the  sense  of  our  impor  tance  differs  between  the  Sydney  and   Melbourne  communities.   In  Melbourne  Jews  number  more  and  count  more.  Muslims  are  a  small  er  and  less  strident  community.  In  Sydney  we  have  a  strong  awareness  of  our  vulnerability  in  comparison  with  our  Muslim  counterparts.   Interfaith  dialogue  between  Mus  lims  and  Jews  is  more  sophisticated  in  Sydney  than  in  Melbourne.  It  is  when  we  become  aware  of  our  comparative  powerlessness  that  we  become  more  open  to  understanding  and  allies.   It  is  more  challenging  to  talk  to  Muslims  who  begin  with  concerns  about  us,  who  question  our  beliefs,  practices  and  links  with  Israel  than  with  those  who  hardly  know  us.   Many  Christians,  too,  are  suspi  cious  and  believe  we  have  power  beyond  our  numbers.  The  challenge  for  our  continuing  harmonious  acceptance  in  the  Australian  commu  nity  lies  in  forging  bonds  with  the  increasing  numbers  of  non-Jewish  Australians  who  might  be  our  oppo   nents  or  even  our  enemies.   Interfaith  dialogue  is  just  one  means  of  creating  greater  understand  ing,  but  it  is  possibly  the  most  potent.   Muslims  and  Christian  believers  respect  people  of  faith  and  those  who  are  loyal  to  their  own  traditions  more  than  they  respect  the  secular  and  potentially  value-less  society.   Those  who  have  the  commitment  to  our  traditions  that  enables  us  to   share  our  values  will  find  that  respect  and  friendship  can  be  earned  through  dialogue.

"  A  penny  for  your   AVIVA  BARD   DESPITE  the  unfortunate  fact  that  we  need  money  to  promote  acts  of  goodness  and  kindness,  it's  still  a  good  thing  when  it  comes  our   way.   A  Living  in  Harmony  grant  worth  $50,000  was  presented  by  Federal  Minister  for  Education,  Science  and  Training  Dr  Brendan  Nelson  to  North  Shore  Chabad  House  Rabbi  Nochum  Schapiro  for   the  Goodness  and  Kindness  Campaign  which  has  brought  together  leaders  of  the  Jewish,  Christian  and  Muslim  faiths.   An  initiative  of  North  Shore  Chabad  in  co-operation  with  the  Forum  on  Australia  Islamic   Relations  (FAIR),  the  campaign  has  been  introduced  into  schools  to  promote  positive  deeds  and  inter  faith  harmony.   ""The  main  objective  is  for  chil  dren  to  make  the  world  a  better   place  through  specific  acts  of  kind   ness,""  school  campaign  project  director  Rabbi  Zalman  Kastel  said.   ""This  government  support  will  enable  us  to  involve  thousands  more  children  in  kindness  and  har  mony,""  he  added.   The  campaign  competed  against  592  other  applicants  Australia-wide  for  the  grant.   Applauding  Rabbi  Kastel,  Christian  director  Ray  Corbin  and  Muslim  director  Seyfi  Seyit  for  the  ""steps  you  are  taking  in  affirming  core  Australian  values"",  Dr  Nelson  stressed  the  importance  of  educat  ing  youth  in  light  of  the  war  on  ter   ror.   Developed  in  2002,  the  Goodness  and  Kindness  Campaign  has  been  hosted  in  41  schools  and  a  museum  to  date.   ""We  recently  got  our  4000th  commitment  from  a  child  to  make  the  world  a  better  place""  Rabbi   Kastel  said.   Wide  media  coverage  of  the  campaign  has  created  a  momen   turn  for  the  program  in  Jewish,  Muslim  and  Christian  communities  with  stories  appearing  regularly  in  the  North  Shore  Times,  Australian  Jewish  News,  Australia  Fair  and  regional  papers  in  Newcastle  and   the  Central  Coast.   Attesting  to  the  campaign's  pop  ularity,  ABC  TV's  Compass  program  has  produced  an  hour-long  program  dedicated  to  its  success,  to  be  screened  early  this  year,  and  Channel  Ten's  Cheez  TV  has  screened  three  segments  on  the  topic.   ""Based  on  the  expressions  of  interest  we  have  received  from  schools,  we  anticipate  that  by  2004  we-  should  reach  at  least  10,000  students.

"  Living  in  harmony  in  the  City  of  Churches   MELISSA  SINGER   IT’S  rare  to  see  kosher  and  halal  after  noon  tea  at  the  same  function,  but  300   people  recently  attended  the  first  of  a  six-part  seminar  series  in  Adelaide  aimed  at  increasing  dialogue  between  Muslims  and  Jews.   Speakers  at  the  Project  Abraham  seminar  included  rabbis  from  the  local  Jewish  communities  -  both  Orthodox  and  Progressive  -  as  they  and  representatives  of  South  Aus  tralia’s  Muslim  community  discussed  the  common  heritages  of  Jews  and   Muslims.   Project  Abraham  is  a  joint  venture  between  the  Jewish  Community  Council  of  South  Australia  (JCCSA)  and  the  Muslim  community  of  South   Australia.   Rabbi  David  Kopstein  of  Adelaide’s  Beit  Shalom  Synagogue  said  that  while  the  atmosphere  was  initially  “tense”,  the  seminar  had  a  positive   outcome.   “Most  of  the  rhetoric  between  the  Muslim  and  Jewish  communities  has  been  harsh  and  hateful.  Hopefully,  these  conferences  will  be  soft  and  ten  der,”  he  told  the  Australian  Jewish   News.   JCCSA  president  Norman  Schuel  er  is  confident  the  project  will  “achieve  an  understanding  and  therefore  an  acceptance  of  each  other’s  beliefs,  tra  ditions  and  ways  of  life”.   “If  we  build  up  a  trust  and  close  relationship,  we  hope  that  could  translate  into  educating  people  imme  diately  involved  in  the  conflict  in  the   Middle  East.”   SBS  Hebrew  radio  journalist  Yehu  da  Kaplan  —  who  attended  the  semi  nar  -  hopes  Project  Abraham  sets  a   precedent  for  other  Jewish  and  Mus   lim  communities  to  “discuss  issues  other  than  politics”   “This  [project]  is  government  endorsed.  It’s  forcing  people  to  come  and  meet,”  said  Kaplan.   Project  founder  Katherine  Goode  described  the  lead-up  to  the  inaugural  seminar  had  been  “a  dream  run”  as  she  paid  tribute  to  her  co-organisers.   Named  after  the  Jewish  patriarch,  the  project  was  conceived  by  Goode  in  2003  and  received  a  $40,000  Federal  Government  Living  in  Harmony  grant   “Most  of  the  rhetoric  between  the  Muslim  and  Jewish   communities  has  been  harsh  and  hateful.

"  European  leaders  tackle  antisemitism   TOBY  AXELROD   BERLIN  —  As  Jewish  leaders  from  around  Europe  gathered  to  assess  the  past  and  plan  for  the  future,  the  fight  against  antisemitism  remained  their  number-one  priority.   “In  the  last  year  our  efforts  were  concentrated  on  issues  of  anti  semitism,  which  have  been  very  seri  ous  again  in  Europe.  It  is  a  serious  issue  everywhere,”  said  Cobi  Benatoff  of  Italy,  president  of  the  European  Jewish  Congress  (EJC).   Also  on  the  agenda  were  issues  related  to  the  enlargement  of  the  Euro  pean  Union,  the  EU  constitution,  the  proposed  admission  of  Turkey  into  the  union  and  the  ELPs  relationship  with  Israel.  Representatives  of  some  25  countries,  including  several  new  EU  members,  attended  the  conference,  which  was  held  at  a  Jewish  communi  ty  centre  here.   Speaking  last  Sunday  at  the  group’s  annual  meeting,  Benatoff  said  the  EJC  is  planning  to  meet  with  EU  education  ministers  to  “find  ways  of  introducing  into  the  curricula  in  Europe  subjects  that  will  act  as  a  vaccine  against  preju  dice  in  our  younger  generations”.   Also  essential  in  the  struggle  against  antisemitism  is  a  dialogue  with  Euro  pean  Christian  and  Muslim  leaders.   Roger  Culderman,  an  EJC  vice  president  and  head  of  the  French  Jew  ish  communal  organisation  CRIF,  said  his  group  has  been  actively  involved  in   such  dialogue  with  moderate  and  less  moderate  Muslim  groups.   Perhaps  as  a  result,  the  leader  of  one  Muslim  group  issued  a  statement  this  year  saying  that  attacks  on  Jews  are  like  attacks  on  the  Koran.   “While  Muslim  antisemitism  is  a  source  of  great  concern,  there  recently  has  been  a  rise  of  the  more  traditional  antisemitism  from  right-wing  extrem  ist  groups,”  said  Serge  Cwajgenbaum  of  France,  the  EJC  s  general  secretary.  “We  can  imagine  it  will  continue  and   even  increase.”   “There  recently  has  been  a  rise  of  the  more   traditional  antisemitism  from  right-wing   extremist  groups.”   I  SERGE  CWAJGENBAUM   European  Jewish  Congress   general  secretary   He  suggested  that  the  increase  is  directly  related  to  the  opening  of  Euro  pean  borders.  Recent  vandalism  against  Jewish,  Christian  and  Muslim  cemeteries  in  France’s  Alsace  region  has  been  attributed  to  German  and  French  right-wing  extremists.   “The  more  we  see  the  integration  of  new  countries  into  Europe,  the  more  nationalistic  issues  will  appear,”  Cwaj  genbaum  said.

But  there  is  hope  for  a  united  front  against  antisemitism,  said  Henry  Grunwald,  an  EJC  vice-president  and  head  of  the  Board  of  Deputies  of  British  Jews.   Grunwald  praised  meetings  on  antisemitism  this  past  year  with  the  European  Commission  and  the  Organisation  for  Security  and  Co  operation  in  Europe  (OSCE),  and  sug  gested  it  was  time  to  follow  through  on   the  “Berlin  Declaration”  a  commit  ment  from  the  OSCE  meeting  in  April  to  improve  monitoring  and  combat  ing  of  antisemitism  across  Europe.   “We  feel  that  both  European  and  national  authorities  have  become  pro  active  in  the  fight  against  anti  semitism”  Benatoff  said,  “although  they  are  not  acting  as  fast  as  we  would   wish”.   Despite  concerns  about  anti  semitism,  several  Jewish  communal  leaders  stressed  in  their  reports  to  the  EJC  that  relations  with  government  leaders  are  positive.   Representatives  of  Ukraine  and  Lithuania  said  recent  political  cam  paigns  there  seemed  relatively  devoid   of  antisemitic  content   ITA ",2004-11-19

"  Gene  Simmons  as  the  Kiss  bass  guitarist.   Kiss  and  makeup  for  Gene   STAFF  REPORTER   KISS  bass  guitarist  Gene  Simmons  has  backtracked  from  statements  he  made  during  a  tour  of  Australia  last  month  that  were  criticised  as  being  anti-Muslim.   The  son  of  Auschwitz  survivors,  Simmons  said  he  was  referring  to  extremists  when  he  told  Radio  3AW  that  Islam  “is  a  vile  culture”.   The  Israeli-born  American  musi   cian  said  “they  want  to  come  and  live  right  where  you  live  and  they  think  that  you’re  evil”.   “Extremism  believes  that  it’s  okay  to  strap  bombs  onto  your  children   and  send  them  to  paradise  and  what  ever  else  and  behead  people,”  he  said.   Simmons  said  the  United  Nations   approach  did  not  work  and  the  West  had  to  “speak  softly  and  carry  a  big  stick.  This  is  a  vile  culture  and  if  you  think  for  a  second  that  it’s  going  to  just  live  in  the  sands  of  God’s  armpit,  you’ve  got  another  think  coming.”   After  members  of  Australia’s  Mus  lim  community  flooded  the  station  with  protests,  Simmons  told  Aus   tralian  Associated  Press  that  his  com  ments  had  been  taken  out  of  context   “I  was  asked  about  extremists,”  he  said,  “and  that’s  what  I  was  talking  about  -  only  extremists.”   Simmons  also  criticised  Islam  as   sexist,  saying  Muslim  women  had  to   walk  behind  their  men  and  were  not  allowed  to  be  educated  or  to  own  houses.   Islamic  Council  of  Victoria  presi  dent  Yasser  Soliman  said  Simmons’  comments  were  “very  unfortunate”.   “He’s  famous  and  popular  and,  as  a  result,  influential.  Mixing  the  enter  tainment  world  with  the  political  and  religious  world  is  a  minefield.”   Simmons,  54,  was  bom  Chaim  Witz  in  Haifa  in  1949.

"  Muslims,  Jews  meet  in  France   PHILIP  CARMEL   PARIS  -  It’s  not  every  day  that  a  radical  Islamic  organisation  whose  spiritual  mentor  backs  suicide  bombings  meets  with  a  leading  Jewish  group.   But  in  a  highly  publicised  visit  on  September  9,  the  Union  of  French  Islamic  Organisations,  the  country’s  largest  Islamic  group,   met  with  the  CRIF  umbrella  organisation  of  French  Jews  at   CRIF’s  offices  here.   The  event  was  not  a  first   because  officials  from  both  organ  isations  met  secretly  last  year  in  the  offices  of  former  interior  minister  Nicolas  Sarkozy.  CRIF’s  president,  Roger  Cukierman,  and  the  Islamic  group’s  general  secretary,  Fouad  Alaoui,  also  recently  engaged  in  a   debate  on  national  radio.   The  radio  debate  was  largely  friendly,  leading  Cukierman  to  invite  the  union  for  further  talks.  That  invitation,  according  to  CRIF,  was  followed  up  by  a  formal  letter,  which,  after  lengthy  internal  debate  within  the  union,  was  accepted  this  month.   The  publicity  given  to  the  meeting  and  the  pride  taken  by  the   union  at  the  invitation  have  accen   tuated  a  growing  perception  that  the  movement  is  moving  firmly  into  the  political  mainstream.   But  several  groups,  Jewish  and  not,  expressed  concerns  about  the  meeting,  worrying  publicly  that  CRIF  was  being  used  by  the  union,  and  that  by  taking  part  in  the  meeting,  CRIF  was  offering  the  Muslim  group  unwarranted  legitimacy.   As  part  of  a  delegation  from  France’s  Muslim  Council,  Alaoui  recently  returned  from  Iraq,  where  he  had  travelled  to  plead  for  the  release  of  two  French  hostages  currently  held  by  an  Iraqi  terror  group  demanding  that  France  repeal  its  new  law  banning  the   Muslim  veil  in  state  schools.   That  trip  -  and  the  sudden  dilution  of  the  union’s  fervent  opposition  to  the  legislation  -  have  won  the  group  plaudits  from  many  who  see  it  as  finally  accept  ing  the  basic  tenets  of  France’s  sec   ular  republic.

"  Outlook   Hilaly  should  be  pulled  into  line   THE  most  positive  aspect  of  the  latest  storm  to  break  around  Sheikh   Tajeddin  al  Hilaly  has  been  the  number  of  calls  to  talkback  radio  from  Australian  Muslims  anxious  to  distance  themselves  from  him.  They  were  keen  to  impress  upon  the  public  that  Sheikh  Hilaly  -  Grand  Mufti  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand  —  does  not  speak  for  them.   Indeed,  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria  president  Yasser  Soliman  made  that  dear  to  a  Jewish  audience  last  year.  Sheikh  Hilaly  “does  not  represent  —  and  shouldn’t  be  seen  as  representing  -  anybody  except  himself’,  he  declared.  “He  has  no  binding  say  on  the  Muslim  community  in  Australia.”   It  is  a  matter  for  any  community  whom  it  appoints  as  its  lay  and  spiritu  ’  al  leaders,  but  Soliman’s  observation  serves  to  confirm  that  it  is  high  time  the   roof  body  of  Australia’s  300,000-strong  Muslim  community  did  something  about  the  fact  that  the  man  who  claims  to  be  its  spiritual  leader  consistent  ly  does  it  -  and  Australian  society  at  large  -  a  serious  disservice.   The  most  recent  controversy  centres  on  allegations  that  Sheikh  Hilaly  last  month  called  for  a  jihad  against  Israel,  defended  suicide  bombings,  expressed  support  for  the  Hezbollah  terrorist  organisation  and  described  September  11  as  “God’s  work  against  oppressors”.   His  spokesmen  deny  the  allegations,  claiming  variously  that  the  remarks  were  inaccurately  translated  or  taken  out  of  context.   Whether  or  not  the  sheikh  made  the  precise  remarks  attributed  to  him,  his  record  on  interfaith  relations  is  not  only  shameful,  but  the  antithesis  of  what  it  should  be  as  the  spiritual  leader  of  a  proud  and  self-respecting  community.   Apart  from  his  inappropriate  involvement  in  a  street  rally,  when  he  carried  a  photograph  of  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  defaced  with  a  Hitler  moustache,  the  sheikh  has  a  litany  of  racist  comments  to  his  name,  dating  back  to  1988,  when  he  accused  Jews  of  being  “the  underlying  cause  of  all  wars  threatening  the  peace  and  security  of  the  whole  inhabited  earth”.   When  caught  on  camera  or  reported  in  the  media,  his  defence  is  invariably  that  he  has  been  misquoted  -  yet  on  that  occasion  the  translation  was  verified  by  the  NSW  Ethnic  Affairs  Commission,  while  his  latest  remarks  about  Sep  tember  11  were  reportedly  confirmed  by  the  Australian  Embassy  in  Beirut   IT  is  time  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  (AFIC)  -  which   conferred  the  title  of  sheikh  on  Hilaly  and  reportedly  pays  his  salary  -  pulled  him  into  line.   It  is  time  that  Australia’s  peak  Muslim  body  acknowledges  that  the  sheikh’s  record  of  vitriol  reflects  poorly  on  his  community  in  the  context  of  a  multi  cultural  society  which  sets  store  by  tolerance  and  acceptance  of  difference.   It  is  noteworthy  that  the  issue  has  been  taken  up  at  the  highest  level.  The  Prime  Minister  said  that  if  the  latest  remarks  were  accurately  reported,  the  sheikh  “deserves  to  be  condemned  in  the  strongest  possible  terms”.   The  Foreign  Minister  and  Opposition  Leader  have  both  slammed  the  alleged  comments,  while  Federal  MP  Christopher  Pyne  said  that  the  Attorney-General  should  investigate  what  action  could  be  taken  and  that  the  Muslim  community  should  find  a  new  mufti.   And  this  week,  Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  Gary  Hardgrave  called  on  .  Australia’s  Islamic  leaders  to  assert  their  authority  and  ensure  that  their   members  are  not  “tarnished”  by  the  sheikh’s  views.   Sheikh  Hilaly  “is  not  the  person  many  Muslims  would  regard  as  a  leader  of  their  community”,  Hardrgave  said.  “It’s  important  that  AFIC  be  encouraged  to  be  out  there  and  assert  their  greater  authority.”   It  should  not  be  the  case  that  the  government  has  to  call  on  one  of  Australia’s  major  faith  communities  to  curb  the  language  of  its  so-called  spiritual  leader.   Yet  time  and  again,  the  sheikh  has  been  condemned  by  his  own  words.  It  is  time  that  the  elected  leadership  of  the  Australian  Muslim  community   drew  a  line  in  the  sand.

"  Outlook   Liberty  looking   tarnished  in  France   THE  destruction  of  a  Jewish  community  centre  in  Paris  on  Sunday,   hard  on  the  heels  of  the  desecration  of  60  Jewish  graves  in  the  French  city  of  Lyon  last  week,  would  be  serious  enough  if  these  were   isolated  incidents.   Unfortunately,  the  reverse  is  true.  They  were  but  the  latest  in  an  escalating  tide  of  attacks  on  France’s  Jewish  community,  which  sustained  135  recorded  incidents  in  the  first  six  months  of  2004,  potentially  doubling   the  125  which  occurred  in  all  of  2003.   It  is  a  tide  which  has  seen  a  swastika  cut  into  the  face  of  a  12-year-old  Jewish  girl;  a  14-year-old  kippa-wearing  youth  called  a  “dirty  Jew”,  knocked  down  and  robbed  in  front  of  a  large  crowd  outside  a  metro  underground;  a  '  Jewish  dayschool  teacher  assaulted,  her  Magen  David  ripped  from  her  neck   and  her  hair  set  alight;  and  yellow  Stars  of  David  painted  in  Paris’  Jewish  Quarter,  accompanied  by  the  slogan  “Don’t  forget  the  showers  of  Zyklon”,  referring  to  the  gas  used  in  the  Nazi  camps  -  and  all  of  this  within  a  few  weeks.   The  majority  of  the  crimes  are  being  committed  by  French  Muslim  Arabs  -  descendants  of  immigrants  from  Algeria  and  other  former  French  colonies   in  North  Africa.   Relations  between  the  second-largest  Jewish  population  outside  Israel  (the  600,000  Jews  of  France)  and  the  largest  Muslim  population  in  Europe  (six  mil  lion  Muslim  Arabs)  have  been  deteriorating  since  the  intifada  was  lit  four  years  ago.  As  is  the  case  with  communities  worldwide,  the  tension  is  fuelled  by  erup  tions  along  the  Israeli-Palestinian  divide  and  the  way  they  are  portrayed  in  the  media  -  invariably  with  minimal  context  and  often  with  rank  distortion.   According  to  some  historians,  the  situation  is  the  latest  manifestation  of  the  uneasy  relationship  which  stems  from  the  Algerian  origins  of  French  Jews  and  French  Muslims  -  a  relationship  which  is  now  coloured  by  the  post-9/11  anti  Israel  and  antisemitic  epidemic.   While  Algerian  Jews  were  regarded  as  inferior  to  Algerian  Muslims  for  many  years,  the  situation  was  reversed  in  1870,  when  France  -  which  had  colonised  the  North  African  country  -  granted  French  citizenship  to  Algeria’s  Jews,  but  not  to  their  Muslim  compatriots,  creating  enormous  resentment.   LAST  December,  President  Jacques  Chirac  announced  his  intention  to   ban  religious  symbols  and  clothing  -  Muslim  headscarves,  Jewish  skull  caps  and  large  Christian  crosses  -  at  state  schools  and  hospitals.   Such  symbols  threaten  the  separation  of  Church  and  State  and  the  cohesion  of  the  French  people,  he  declared.  “Secularity  is  one  of  the  republic’s  great  achievements.  It  plays  a  crucial  role  in  social  harmony  and  national   cohesion.  We  must  not  allow  it  to  be  weakened.”   While  Muslims  around  the  world  objected,  most  French  people  supported  the  ban.  Even  though  it  was  directed  at  three  religions,  it  was  interpreted  as  an  attempt  to  curb  Islamic  fundamentalism.   Although  some  Jewish  and  Christian  leaders  also  objected  -  for  reasons  of  human  rights,  freedom  of  expression  and  because  it  could  alienate  Muslims  and  drive  fundamentalism  underground  -  many  French  Jews  did  not,  reflecting  the  general  concern  at  the  rise  in  fundamentalism.   Last  month  Chirac  pointedly  visited  the  village  of  Chambon-sur-Lignon  -  the  scene  of  one  of  the  inspiring  stories  of  the  Holocaust,  when  5000  Protestants  hid  5000  Jews  -  and  called  for  antisemitic  violence  to  cease  and  for  perpetrators  to  face  tougher  punishments.   Adding  to  the  volatile  mix  is  the  recent  call  by  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  for  all  French  Jews  to  emigrate  to  Israel,  prompting  a  furious  Chirac  to  respond  that  Sharon  was  unwelcome  in  France.   There  is  a  delicate  balancing  act  between  a  country  remaining  a  multicultural  society  -  which  Chirac  cites  as  a  priority  -  and  defusing  a  rising   tide  of  fundamentalism  and  antisemitism.   In  the  meantime,  France’s  motto,  “Liberty,  Equality,  Fraternity”,  is  looking  decidedly  tarnished. ",2004-08-27
"  Downer  rejects  claims  of  racism  over  Sheikh  Hilaly   MICHAEL  CAVANAGH   FOREIGN  Affairs  Minister  Alexan  der  Downer  has  rejected  allegations  that  he  is  being  racist  following  his  decision  to  exclude  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly  from  an  Australian  delega   tion  to  an  inter-faith  conference  being  staged  in  Indonesia  next  week.   Downer  preferred  to  take  along  the  elected  president  of  the  Aus  tralian  Federation  of  Islamic  Coun   cils,  Dr  Ameer  Ah.  Sheikh  Hilaly  responded  by  accusing  Downer  of  racism,  with  his  spokesman,  Keysar  Trad,  explaining  that  “again,  Mr  Downer  has  not  shown  enough  respect  to  the  Muslim  faith  by  not  sending  a  member  of  the  Muslim  clergy.”   Sheikh  Hilaly  is  the  self-described  grand  mufti  of  Australia  who  has  met  with  Hezbollah  leaders  in  Lebanon  and  been  accused  of  supporting  Pales   tinian  suicide  bombers.  He  describes  himself  as  the  “spiritual  leader”  of  Australia’s  300,000  Muslims.

A  spokesperson  for  Downer  told  the  AJN  that  there  were  no  plans  to  change  the  make-up  of  the  group.  And  in  a  swipe  at  the  hardline  stance  often  taken  by  Sheikh  Hilaly,  Downer  indicated  his  selection  of  the  delega  tion  members  was  also  influenced  by  the  ability  of  the  representatives  to  listen  to  all  sides  of  the  argument.   “We  have  chosen  people  of  mod  eration  and  it’s  very  important  that  we  have  the  right  sort  of  people   involved.  I  mean  we  don’t  want  to  have  a  provocative  forum,  we  want  to  have  a  conciliatory  and  consensus  building  forum,”  Downer  said.   Fourteen  countries  will  attend  the  two-day  conference,  which  is  co  funded  by  Australia.  The  Australian  delegation  will  include  10  people:  six  Christians,  as  well  as  one  each  from  the  Jewish,  Muslim,  Hindu  and  Buddhist  faiths. ",2004-12-03

The  166-page  report  documented  more  than  1300  religion-based  hate  incidents  in  2003.

"  Costello  warns  Sheikh  Hilaly   DAN  GOLDBERG   EXTREMISTS  are  not  welcome  in  Australia,  Treasurer  Peter  Costello  has  warned  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly.   Addressing  1600  guests  at  the  Unit  ed  Israel  Appeal’s  campaign  launch  in  Melbourne,  Costello  said  the  Federal  Government  had  “noted  with  con  cern”  recent  statements  by  the  63-year  old  spiritual  leader  of  Australia’s  300,000-strong  Muslim  community.   “Suggestions  of  extremism,  giving  succour  to  fanaticism,  have  no  place  in  Australian  society,  and  our  govern  ment  will  not  allow  it,”  Costello  said.   He  was  referring  to  a  speech  by  Sheikh  Hilaly,  imam  of  Lakemba  Mosque,  at  Sidon  Mosque  in  Lebanon  on  February  13  in  which  he  called  for  a  jihad  against  Israel,  suggested  that  9/11  was  “God’s  work  against  oppres  sors”,  praised  “the  bones  of  shaheeds  [martyrs]”  and  predicted  that  the  muezzin’s  call  for  prayer  will  one  day  be  sounded  from  the  top  of  the  White   House.   “There  is  no  place  in  Australia  to  give  comfort  or  succour  to  extremists  or  terrorists,”  Costello  said.  “This  is  why  the  government  has  noted  with   concern  some  of  the  recent  statements  of  the  mufti  of  the  Lakemba  Mosque.”   Urged  to  investigate  Sheikh  Hilaly  -  who  visited  the  spiritual  leader  of   Hezbollah,  Sheikh  Hassan  Nasrallah,  whose  militant  wing  is  outlawed  in  Australia  -  the  Australian  Federal  Police  examined  his  conduct  overseas  and  ruled  out  criminal  charges  because  he  did  not  breach  Australia’s  terrorism  laws.   “There  is  no  place  in  Australia  to  give   comfort  or  succour  to  extremists.  This  is  why  the  government  has  noted  with   concern  some  of  the  recent  statements  of  the  mufti  of  the  Lakemba  Mosque.”   Sheikh  Hilaly  received  Australian  citizenship  in  1990,  following  his  arrival  from  Egypt  in  1982.   After  a  failed  attempt  to  deport  him  in  1986  for  “incitement  to  racial  hatred”  by  then-immigration  minister  Chris  Hurford,  the  tide  of  Grand  Mufti  of  Australia  was  bestowed  on  him  by  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  (AFIC)  in  1988  -  the  same  year  the  sheikh  told  a  University  of  Sydney  audience  that  the  Jews  were  “the  underlying  cause  of  all  wars  threatening  the  peace  and  security  of   the  whole  inhabited  earth”   A  spokesperson  from  the  Depart  ment  of  Citizenship  and  Multicultural  Affairs  told  the  Australian  Jewish  News   that  there  were  specific  conditions  under  which  a  person’s  citizenship  could  be  revoked  under  the  Citizen   ship  Act  (1948):  if  a  person  has  been  convicted  of  an  offence  for  knowingly  making  a  statement  that  is  false  or  mis  leading  in  the  application  for  citizen   PETER  COSTELLO   Federal  Treasurer   ship;  if,  after  applying  for  citizenship,  a  person  has  been  convicted  and  sen  tenced  to  imprisonment  for  not  less  than  12  months  for  an  offence  that  was  committed  before  the  approval  of  the  application;  if  he/she  obtained  citizen  ship  as  a  result  of  migration-related  fraud;  or  if  a  person  serves  in  an  army  of  a  country  at  war  with  Australia.   Costello,  who  last  week  ruled  out  a  leadership  challenge  against  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  prior  to  the  election,  barely  touched  on  the  econo  my,  focusing  on  the  war  on  terror  and   Israel’s  and  Australia’s  shared  values.   His  warning  to  Sheikh  Hilaly  fol  lowed  condemnation  by  Howard,  For  eign  Minister  Alexander  Downer  and   Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  Gary  Hardgrave,  who  has  urged  Muslim   eaders  to  rein  in  the  sheikh.   Criticism  has  also  come  from  Mus  lim  ranks.  One  of  Australia’s  longest  serving  Muslim  leaders,  Melbourne  Sheikh  Fehmi  Naji,  told  ABC  Radio  the  sheikh  should  be  stripped  of  his  tide  as  mufti  and  Muslim  leaders  were   urging  AFIC  to  assert  its  authority.   Costello:  “If  you  feed  people  lies,  you  incite  them  to  violence.  If  you  jus  tify  violence,  you  will  never  stop  it”   He  criticised  the  “moral  equiva  lence”  promoted  by  sections  of  the  media  in  coverage  of  the  Middle  East   “One  of  the  frustrations  I  have  is  the  view  that  there’s  moral  equivalence  between  somebody  who  has  targeted  innocents  and  a  defence  which  targets  the  organisers  of  lolling.   “Australia  will  defend  its  people  igainst  the  threat  of  terror  in  this  region,  the  US  will  defend  its  people  igainst  the  organisers  of  September  11  md  Israel  has  every  right  to  defend  its  people  against  the  threat  of  terror.

"  European  report  finds  rise  in   antisemitism  but  avoids  cause   JONATHAN  FISK   STRASBOURG  -  A  long-awaited  report  on  European  antisemitism  con  firms  that  it  is  a  growing  problem   across  the  continent  -  but  dances  around  the  politically  sensitive  ques  tion  of  who  is  responsible.   The  344-page  report  by  the  Euro  pean  Monitoring  Centre  on  Racism  and  Xenophobia  (EUMC)  details  a   rise  in  antisemitic  incidents  in  Bel   gium,  France,  Germany,  the  Nether  lands  and  England.   Physical  assaults  are  absent  or  rare  in  Greece,  Austria,  Italy  and  Spain,  the  report  found,  but  antisemitic  dis   course  is  virulent  there  as  well.   Those  findings  are  unlikely  to  sur  prise  observers  who  have  watched  a  rash  of  antisemitic  outbursts  spread  across  Europe  since  the  Palestinian  intifada  began  in  September  2000.   More  surprising  was  the  almost  passing  reference  made  to  the  perpe   trators.  Newer  actors  such  as  immi   grant  Muslim  youth  are  mentioned  in  the  report,  but  an  EUMC  press  release  accompanying  the  report  sought  to  highlight  the  role  of  more  traditional  sources  of  antisemitism,  such  as  far  right  groups  and  skinheads.   That  came  as  a  shock  to  Jewish  groups,  who  were  furious  when  the  EUMC  quashed  an  earlier  report  last   year  identifying  Muslims  and  pro  Palestinian  left-wingers  as  the  main   sources  of  the  “new  antisemitism”  in  Europe.   The  EUMC  said  that  report  was  withheld  because  of  methodological  shortcomings  -  it  eventually  was  released  under  pressure  from  Jewish  groups  -  but  many  suspected  the  find  ings  simply  had  proven  politically  unpalatable  given  Europe’s  huge  Mus  lim  immigrant  community.   I  “The  EU  still  appears   unwilling  to   acknowledge  its  own  findings  that  Muslim  immigrant  youth  are   increasingly  responsible  for  antisemitic  violence”   STATEMENT  BY  THE  ANTI-DEFAMATION  LEAGUE   “After  the  scandal  of  the  previous  report,  the  EUMC  has  compiled  an  impressive  quantitative  analysis  that  shows  an  unprecedented  wave  of  anti  semitism  in  Europe,”  Elan  Steinberg,  executive  vice-president  of  the  World  Jewish  Congress,  told  JTA.  “But  they  studiously  avoid  going  into  the  causes  of  the  antisemitism;  you’re  almost  left   with  the  impression  that  it  occurred  from  outer  space.  It’s  an  intellectual   whitewash  and  an  instance  of  moral  cowardice.”   Serge  Cwajgenbaum,  secretary  general  of  the  European  Jewish  Con  gress,  said:  “It’s  contradictory  that  the  EUMC  puts  an  emphasis  on  [white,  right-wing  perpetrators],  whereas  the  report  reveals  that  the  majority  of   attacks  in  most  countries  are  commit   ted  by  young  Muslims  or  [people  of]  North  African  origin.”   “The  EU  still  appears  unwilling  to  acknowledge  its  own  findings  that  Muslim  immigrant  youth  are  increas  ingly  responsible  for  antisemitic  vio  lence  motivated  by  the  conflict  in  the  Middle  East,”  the  Anti-  Defamation  League  noted  in  a  statement.   According  to  the  study,  “racist  inci  dents  decrease  when  political  leader  ship  makes  it  publicly  clear  that  there  is  zero  tolerance  for  xenophobia”,  she   said.   The  report  marks  the  first  time  that   data  on  antisemitism  has  been  collect   ed  systematically  across  all  15  EU  member  states  under  common  guide  lines  set  down  by  the  EUMC.   “[The  report]  confirms  our  worst  fears:  the  level  of  antisemitism  is  such  that  we  can  describe  it  as  the  most  seri  ous  since  the  end  of  World  War  II,”   Steinberg  said.

If  we  scan  the  world  news  each  day  we  can  easily  find  reasons  why  relationships   between  our  two  communities  are  dis  tant,  distrustful  and  even  fearful.   “But  it  is  important,  I  think,  to  recognise  that  most  of  the  trouble  spots  are  elsewhere,”  Dr  Gardner  said.   Funded  by  the  Department  of  Immigration,  Multicultural  and  Indigenous  Affairs,  “Building  Bridges:  Becoming  friends,  Jews  and  Muslims”  is  a  collaboration  of  the  ADC  and  the  Australian  Intercultural  Society  (AIS).

AIS  director  Ergun  Kirmaci  said  the  program  would  bring  Jewish  and  Muslim  communities  closer  together  and  combat  prejudice  that  exists  between  the  two  groups.   “All  participants  will  have  the  abil  ity  to  learn  about  the  values  and  beliefs  of  the  other  faith  groups  and  under  stand  why  it  is  they  are  different”   The  event  was  attended  by  US  Con  sul-General  David  Hopper,  Indone  sian  Consul-General  Wahid  Supriyadi  and  Turkish  Vice-Consul  Kagan  Yil  maz  as  well  as  Mount  Scopus’  Rabbi  Ralph  Genende  and  Temple  Beth  Israel’s  Emeritus  Rabbi  John  Levi.

"  TAPESTRY   DANIHASKI   The  late  Screaming  Lord  Sutch  was  one  of  Britain’s  longest-serving  political  leaders  as   head  of  the  Official  Monster  Raving  Loony  Party.  Sutch  was  famous  for  his  unusual  views,  dress  sense,  and  a  strong  supporter  of  individualism.   FOR  any  religious  community   with  a  distinct  sartorial  flavour,  a  recent  French  policy  initiative  must  seem  like  the  thin  end  of  the  wedgie  for  the  proponents  of  radi   cal  secularism.   As  has  been  widely  reported  in  the  media,  the  French  Government,  supported  by  President  Jacques  Chirac,  has  recently  passed  legislation  that  will  ""explicitly  ban  the  ostentatious  wearing  of  any  political  or  religious  sign"",  mostly  from  public  work  places  and  schools.   They  have  defined  religious  signs  as  headscarves,  skullcaps  and  large  crosses  (although  how  large  is  not  clear).   If  we  take  the  ban  to  its  natural  conclusion,  in  the  land  of  Liberte,  Egalite,  Fraternite,  there  is  no  room  for  kufis,  kippot,  turbans,  crowns,  headbands,  sheitels,  scarves,  hijabs  or  burkhas  walking  the  streets;  no  more  dog  collars  or  flowing  bro  cade  robes  (perhaps  Jean  Paul  Gaultier  could  design  the  Pope  a  fetching  new  pointy  bra  for  his   next  visit  to  France  so  as  to  not  offend  non-Catholics).   There  would  be  no  more  cruci  fixes,  crescent  moons  or  chais  on  chains  worn  around  the  neck  and  no  more  ""Jesus  is  coming!  Look  busy""  T-shirts  either,  for  fear  of  offending  practising  Christians  and  people  with  no  sense  of  humour.   A  group  of  prominent  French  women  have  supported  the  ban,  signing  a  letter  stating  that  they  find  the  hijab,  traditional  head  scarves  worn  by  some  Muslim  women,  offensive  and  a  symbol  of  the  Islamic  subjugation  of  women.   If  we  focus  on  apparel  that  offends  and  subjugates  women,  the  French  should  look  in  their  own  yard  posterieur.  Many  secular  women  find  the  Paris  catwalk  fash  ions  a  serious  affront.  Whether  we  have  the  body  for  it  or  not,  who  in  their  right  mind  would  wear  a  chif   fon  blouse  to  work  with  no  bra?   Isn't  a  radical  secularism  that  coerces  woman  not  to  wear  the  veil  the  same  as  religious  funda   mentalism  that  forces  them  to  cover  themselves  for  the  sake  of  their  virtue?  Are  women  of  faith  not  capable  of  picking  out  their   own  clothes?   Many  young  Muslim  women  are  choosing  to  adopt  the  veil,  cit  ing  traditional  feminist  argument  as  their  justification  -  wearing  the  veil  they  feel  that  they  are  judged  on  their  performance  not  on  their  appearance.  And  that's  the  point,   isn't  it?   In  Western  culture  everybody  is  judged  by  his  or  her  appearance.   Whether  you're  a  young  Muslim  woman  at  a  French  public  school  trying  to  get  a  decent  edu  cation  or  a  pierced  and  tattooed  teenager  trying  to  look  all  tough  and  anti-establishment  or  a  corpo  rate  kingpin  in  designer  duds  walk  ing  the  walk,  everyone  dresses  in  a  way  that  says  something  about  who  they  are  or,  more  often,  who  they  want  to  be.   People  of  strong  religious  faith  often  express  their  faith  through  their  attire.  If  people  are  offended  by  others'  clothing,  shouldn't  they  be  examining  the  reasons  for  their  views?  Why  do  headscarves  or  kip  pot  make  them  uncomfortable?   Banning  ostentatious  religious  symbolism  will  not  solve  the  prob  lem  of  a  growing  unassimilated,  radicalised  Muslim  community.   Experience  has  shown  that  pro  hibition  doesn't  work.  Trying  to  ease  social  tensions  by  playing  fashion  police  will  only  encourage  tyrannical  patriarchs  to  send  their  little  girls  to  fundamentalist  schools  where  they  won't  be  exposed  to  evil  liberal  Western  democratic  thinking  that  will  allow  them  to   make  their  own  choices.   After  all,  in  a  free,  open  and  secular  society  isn't  it  all  about  the   freedom  to  choose?  As  the  French  say,  Vive  la  Difference!

"  France  unscarved   The  French  Government  tries  to  spin  a  progressive  image.  It  stands  up  to  the  US.  Its  resident  extremist  politician,  Jean-Marie  Le  Pen,  has  been  voted  down.  But  its  current  president,  Jacques  Chirac,  is  the  same  man  who  led  the  country  in  nuclear  testing  in  the  South  Pacific  in  the  90s.  His  policies  were  scorned  then  for  their  stubborn  disregard  of  others'  interests.  His  integrity  is  still  tainted,  which  brings  into  question  his  Government's  recent  ban  on  Muslim  headscarfs  (known  as  hijabs)  in  public  schools.  The  ban  wraps  the  gamut  of  French  impressions  into  one;  it  is  held  to  proudly  by  the  Government,  regardless  of  opposition,  but  also  has  inflamed  fervent  protests,  and  it  has  that  undeniably  French  preoccupation  with  clothes.  Many  French  people  cling  to  the  Revolution  as  if  they  invented  egalitarian  ideas.  Like  a  good  French  suit,  this  proud  history  hides  all  manner  of  current  injustices.  France  today  holds  assimilation  as  the  basic  aim  of  migration.  ""French  policy  has  encouraged,  perhaps  coerced,  new  immigrants  to  assimilate  by  adopting  French  tradition,  laws  and  language.  Thus,  anything  that  emphasizes  cultural  and  religious  differences,  such  as  the  Muslim  hijab,  is  seen  as  opposition  to  the  French  model  of  integration  and  cultural  homogeneity,""  says  the  academic  Cynthia  DeBula  Baines.  Among  everyday  French  people,  |  distaste  for  Arab  cultures  is  as  widespread  as  distaste  for  bad  coffee.  And  France  today  expels  Muslim  girls  who  wear  hijabs  to  school.  France  prides  itself  on  constitutional  secularity.  It  is  the  only  European  ,  State  that  legally  removes  the  Church  from  State  institutions.  Yet  under  this  egalitarian  stance,  minorities  feel  a  festering  intolerance.  Protests  march  with  banners  asking,  ""A  ban  against  headscarves  or  a  ban  against  Islam?""  The  ban  certainly  represents  \  an  unusual  approach  to  protect  citizen's  rights.  This  is  simply  put  by  Nihad  Awad,  executive  director  of  the  Council  on  American-Islamic  Relations:  ""A  nation  cannot  claim  to  uphold  principles  of  liberty  and  equality  while  denying  the  religious  rights  of  its  citizens.""  One  Muslim  student  accuses  her  country  of  ""hiding  behind  the  principle  of  secularism  because  Islam  is  new,  and  frightening...  It's  as  if,  as  soon  as  we're  Muslims,  we  don't  belong  here.""  The  problem  is  public  education.  In  their  constitution,  the  French  are  guaranteed  a  right  to  education  without  a  religious  bent.  Once,  this  meant  acceptance  of  all  beliefs,  with  preference  given  to  none.  But  in  the  last  decade,  the  croissant  has  bent  the  other  way.  Policies  have  become  more  and  more  hardline.  And  this  year,  an  outright  prohibition  on  hijabs  was  announced.  Hijabs  are  'ostentatious',  'excessively  large',  and  stop  other  students  from  enjoying  their  secular  education,  claim  Chirac's  government.  The  ban  equates  the  hijab  with  an  offensive  desire  to  provoke  or  proselytise.  To  be  fair,  the  ban  could  also  cover   signs  of  other  religions.  Minister  Luc  Ferry  has  clarified  that  ""big  crucifixes,  kippas,  Muslim  scarves""  are  all  covered.  But  only  if  they  fall  within  the  definition  of  ostensibly  and  offensively  religious.  Unfortunately,  in  practice,  the  first  two  don't  seem  to  be.  The  Government  has  tried  to  placate  the  opposition,  squawking  that  the  ban  applies  to  all  religions.  But  as  the  Government  well  knows,  'excessively  large'  crosses  haven't  been  worn  since  Jesus  shouldered  his  on  the  road  to  Jerusalem.  And  no  Jewish  student  has  been  expelled  for  wearing  a  yarmulke.  Perhaps  the  ban  is  just  forward  thinking,  preparing  for  a  day  when  a  twist  of  fashion  sees  skull  caps  the  size  of  sombreros.  A  range  of  religious  groups  have  criticised  the  law  as  unjust.  ""Everyone  knows  that  people  no  longer  wear  huge  crosses  so  it's  a  kind  of  hypocrisy  to  say  that,  of  course,  we  are  not  against  Jews  or  Muslims  but  against  all  'conspicuous'  signs,""  notes  the  president  of  the  Protestant  Federation  of  France,  Jean-Arnold  de  Clermont.  The  current  policy  seems  to  rely  on  a  judgement  based  arbitrarily  on  size.  Under  the  ban,  and  the  policy  from  which  it  flowed,  over  120  girls  have  been  expelled  for  wearing  a  hijab,  and  no-one  else  has.  The  government's  position  is  that  something  ostensibly  religious  cannot  co-exist  with  secularism.  On  its  face,  reaching  such  an  absolute  seems  unnecessary.  The  wearing  of  the  scarf  does  not  have  any  impact  on  basic  tenents  of  the  secular  system,  including  the  ability  of  a  State  school  to  hire  staff  of  any  faith,  to  refrain  from  promoting  any  one  religion  in  lessons,  or  to  allow  students  the  freedom  to  develop  their  own  beliefs.  The  State  claims  that  hijabs  offend  secular  teachers.  One  has  to  ask,  even  if  the  professors  are  put  out,  is  that  a  good  enough  reason  to  outlaw  religious  expression?  Or  is  it  that  ""a  lot  of  these  girls  are  pressured  into  wearing  the  scarf  by  their  fathers"",  as  one  French  woman  confided  to  this  reporter.  Since  when  did  it  become  the  State's  role  to  step  so  far  into  family  politics?  In  most  states  the  Minister  for  National  Education  is  not  employed  to  dictate  religious  views  within  a  household.  Putting  ourselves  in  Chirac's  position,  we  see  that  he  is  attempting  to  change  these  fathers'  views.  However,  the  Government  analysis  fails  to  respond  to  the  critique  that  the  more  probable  result  will  be  that  the  daughters  will  just  avoid  school,  or  arrive  in  their  hijabs  and  be  expelled.  These  girls  won't  end  up  empowered  at  all  by  the  ban,  but  disadvantaged  and  without  adequate  schooling.  For  many,  the  goal  of  a  secular  State  is  to  create  a  general  acceptance  of  all  religions.  The  French  ban  questions  whether  the  goal  should  actually  be  suppression  of  religions,  to  create  an  a-religious  society.  It  suggests  that  a  façade  of  homogeneity  is  a  worthwhile  achievement.  The  ban  certainly  isn't  about  celebrating  diversity.  The  State  claims  it's  all  about  public  order.  According  to  French  newspapers,  the  Government  wishes   It's  the  beret  that  represents  France  to  most  of  us,  but  there's  an  uglier  side  to  headwear  that  the  French  have  been  keeping  under  their  hat.  Until  now.  These  days,  protestors  say  their  Government  is  just  brazenly  discriminatory.  Alexandra  Grey  explains  why  the  Muslim  headscarf,  recently  banned  in  France,  brings  to  the  fore  the  retigious  tension  brewing  in  many  countries,  j  to  protect  a  frightened  community  to  whom  headscarves  suggest  support  for  fundamentalist  Muslim  terrorists.  If  headscarf-wearers  are  terrorist  sympathisers,  then  the  Government  is  feeding  them  hate  and  ire.  This  isn't  an  empty  projection;  the  Economist  did  report  that  shady  Muslim  groups  made  threats  in  response  to  the  prohibition.  And  if  these  girls  aren't  terrorist  sympathisers,  the  government  is  denying  the  public  a  chance  to  grow  up,  and  to  accept  that  the  Islamic  faith  does  not  have  to  be  synonymous  with  jihad-driven  psychos.  And  the  legality  of  the  ban?  Sure,  the  Government  is  protecting  a  constitutional  right  to  secularism.  But  it  also  appears  to  breach  a  constitutional  right  to  freedom  of  religious  expression.  Under  international  human  rights  conventions,  the  legitimacy  of  the  prohibition  is  also  dubious.  Articles  18  and  19  of  the  International  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Politics  Rights,  to  which  France  is  a  foundational  party,  are  designed  to  promote  freedom  of  religion  and  religious  expression.  And  when  the  EU  Constitution  finally  gets  up  and  running,  this  ban  will  be  in  conflict  with  it.  However,  applying  most  constitutional  and  international  law  relies  on  a  degree  of  interpretation.  A  right  to  religious  expression  can  be  curbed  if  it  undermines  other  people's  rights.  !  An  obligation  not  to  discriminate  can  be  overborne  by  the  State's  right  to  keep  public  order.  So  the  French  Government  implies  that  headscarves  prevent  a  right  to  secular  education,  and  threaten  security.  The  position  has  not  been  thoroughly  developed  by  Government  spokespeople.  If  you  pull  your  headscarf  up  one  inch,  it  becomes  a  bandana,  and  that's  allowed.  (After  all,  a  bandana  only  offends  fashionistas.)  Then  after  school,  the  girls  pull  the  fabric  down  over  their  hair-line.  Voilà!  They  walk  home  in  a  hijab.  This  is  the  appeasement  designed  by  Interior  Minister  M.  Sarkozy,  who  is  against  the  ban.  It  is  a  convenient  compromise.  But  it's  also  one  which  doesn't  actually  face  up  to  the  fundamental  controversy.  It  makes  the  ban  look  ridiculously  pedantic.  It  certainly  doesn't  give  an  image  lift  to  the  French  administration,  which  is  already  ridiculed  for  an  inflexibility  borne  of  incompetence  and  selfinflation.  France  is  not  alone  in  its  'crusade'.  Certain  German  states  have  begun  similar  bans.  Even  Melbourne,  the  most-European  of  our  cities,  is  once  again  following  the  fashion.  In  April  ,a  potential  Olympian  was  sent  off  a  Melbourne  soccer  field  for  wearing  her  hijab.  Happily,  some  sense  prevailed  in  Australia;  the  referee  was  yellow-carded,  not  the  player.  But  in  France,  assimilation  is  Government  policy.  This  is  the  background  to  the  headscarf  law,  designed  on  paper  to  achieve  equality  and  secularity.  But  the  ban's  operation  in  the  real  social  climate,  off  paper,  is  less  simple,  so  it's  easy  to  doubt  whether  this  game  plan  will  ever  create  a  level  playing  field.

"  Gutnick,  Israeli  aircraft,  were  considered  targets   MICHAEL  CAVANAGH   THE  destruction  of  an  Israeli  aircraft   flying  into  Australia  and  the  assassina  tion  of  Joseph  Gutnick  were  among  the  schemes  canvassed  by  the  man  charged  with  conspiring  to  bomb  the  Israeli  Embassy  in  Canberra.   Week  two  of  the  Perth  trial  of  Jack  Roche  heard  how  the  Muslim  convert  met  al-Qaeda’s  Pakistan  leader  Mukhtar,  who  discussed  possible  targets  for  a  terrorist  attack  in   Australia  with  the  accused.   Roche,  50,  who  denies  the  charges,  was  arrested  in  2002  after  raids  were   conducted  by  the  Australian  Security  Intelligence  Organisation  (ASIO).   Excerpts  of  a  nine-hour  taped   interview  between  Roche  and  the  Aus  tralian  Federal  Police  (AFP)  prior  to  his  arrest  were  played  to  the  court   Roche  detailed  meeting  Mukhtar  and  Hambali,  the  man  believed  to  have  masterminded  the  Bali  bombing.   The  police  asked  him  about  his  dis  cussion  with  Mukhtar,  who  expressed   interest  in  Israeli  and  US  business  and   government  operations  in  Australia.   “The  idea  was  to  destroy  these  targets  or  get  rid  of  a  person  consid  ered  to  be  high  up  in  the  organisation  or  administration  of  US  or  Israeli  interests  in  Australia,”  Roche  replied.   “Mukhtar  was  thinking  about  air  lines  that  came  to  Australia  from  US  or  Israel...  but  he  mainly  was  interest  ed  in  the  American  airlines  that  flew  into  Australia  and  people  who  could  be  targeted.”  The  meeting  occurred  at   a  safe  house  in  Pakistan  in  2000.   One  of  those  named  by  Mukhtar  as  a  possible  target  for  assassination  was  Melbourne  identity  Joseph  Gutnick.  “I  believe  Mukhtar  had  heard  of  Gut  nick,  Joe  Gutnick,  and  he  was  asking  who  he  was,”  Roche  told  the  police.   He  told  Mukhtar  (alleged  to  have  masterminded  9/11)  that  Gutnick  had  backed  former  Israeli  prime  minister  Binyamin  Netanyahu’s  campaigns.   Mukthar  was  arrested  in  2003.   Roche:  “I  don’t  think  I  was  seen  as   the  person  to  be  doing  explosives  work   or  assassination  work  in  Australia;  just   basically  a  surveillance  man.”   He  said  Abu  Bakar  Bashir  headed  the  Jemaah  Islamiah  terrorist  organi  sation,  which  had  15  men  in  Australia.   He  met  Bashir  when  he  “popped  around”  to  have  tea  with  the  Indone  sian  Muslim  cleric.  “He  [Bashir]’s  the  one  who  makes  decisions  regarding  JI  in  South  East-Asia,”  he  said.   The  Muslim  cleric,  who  has  denied  links  to  terrorism  or  heading  JI.  is  in  prison  for  immigration  violations.  Indonesian  authorities  say  he  could  face  charges  related  to  JI  terror  attacks.   Roche  claimed  that  he  cut  his  links  with  JI  in  2000.  “We  didn’t  see  eye-to  eye  on  certain  issues  and  I  didn’t  see  any  benefit  in  continuing  my  associa  tion  with  them,”  Roche  told  the  police  in  the  taped  interview.   He  also  spoke  of  meeting  Osama  bin  Laden  in  a  camp  in  Afghanistan.   The  trial  is  expected  to  continue   for  another  week.   With  wire  reports. ",2004-05-28

"  After  fake  attack,  sympathy  turns  to  criticism   PHILIP  CARMEL   PARIS  -  It  took  24  hours  for  demon   strations  in  solidarity  with  France’s  Jewish  community  to  turn  to  oppro  brium  against  it.   The  change  came  on  Tuesday  when  a  23-year-old  non-Jewish  woman  who  claimed  she  had  been  the  victim  of  a   violent  antisemitic  act  admitted  stag  ing  the  incident.   French  Jews  are  hoping  the  incident  won’t  damage  the  fight  against  anti   semitism  in  France.   Given  the  surge  in  antisemitic  inci  dents,  reports  that  the  woman  and  her  baby  had  been  attacked  on  a  Paris  train  sent  shockwaves  through  the  political  establishment  and  the  Jewish  commu  nity.   The  woman  told  police  that  six   men  armed  with  knives  attacked  her   after  .believing,  eironeoiisly  that  she   was  Jewish.  She  said  they  cut  her  hair,  ripped  her  clothing  and  scrawled  three   swastikas  on  her  stomach  with  a  black   pen.  They  then  overturned  a  carriage  containing  her  13-month-old  baby.   Reports  of  the  incident  -  particu  larly  the  woman’s  claim  that  it  occurred  in  view  of  20  witnesses  who  did  nothing  -  drew  swift  condemna  tion,  with  President  Jacques  Chirac  expressing  “horror”.   But  it  soon  became  apparent  that  there  were  holes  in  the  woman’s  story.  With  no  witnesses  coming  forward,  the  woman  -  who  has  a  history  of  making  false  complaints  -  was  placed  in  custody  pending  charges  for  provid  ing  false  information.  She  later  admit  ted  drawing  the  swastikas  herself  with  the  aid  of  a  companion.   Jewish  leaders  initially  focused  their  comments  on  rising  antisemitism  among  Muslim  youth,  particularly  as   the  woman  said  her  attackers  were  “four  Arabs  and  two  Africans”.   Such  remarks  have  led  Muslim  leaders  to  object  to  what  they  see  as  overkill  in  dealing  with  antisemitism.  They  also  charge  that  the  government  has  largely  ignored  racism  targeted  at   Arabs  and  Muslims.   While  Muslim  leaders  initially  expressed  solidarity  with  the  Jewish  community,  the  womans  detention  provoked  a  sharp  change  in  tone.   The  Movement  Against  Racism  and  for  Friendship  Between  Peoples  -   which  has  had  sour  relations  with  the  Jewish  community  -  blasted  “irre  sponsible  statements  used  by  people  who  profited  from  this  fabrication  to  instrumentalise  antisemitism  against  a  specific  population”.   The  remarks  appeared  aimed  at  Jewish  leaders  and  groups,  some  of  whom  -  like  Interior  Minister   Dominique  de  ViUepin  -  issued  state  ments  without  checking  with  the  police.   Despite  the  polemic,  most  racially  inspired  attacks  in  France  do  target  Jews.  Only  hours  before  the  woman’s  claim,  the  government  published  fig  ures  showing  that  of  230  racist  attacks  in  the  first  half  of  2004,  135  were  against  Jewish  targets.   After  the  embarrassment  of  this   incident,  the  Jewish  community  must  face  the  possibility  that  government   ministers  will  be  more  reticent  in  the   future  to  immediately  condemn  anti  semitic  acts.  But  government  spokesman  Jean-Fran&amp;lt;;ois  Cope  said  it  was  necessary  to  “see  that  beyond  the  emotion  engendered  by  this  act  there  is  a  reality  -  the  explosion  of  antise   •  mitic  acts  in  France”.

"  France  bans  kippas,  headscarves  in  schools   PARIS  -  The  French  parliament  voted  overwhelmingly  this  week  to  ban  stu  dents  from  wearing  religious  apparel  such  as  yarmulkes  and  Islamic  head  scarves  in  public  schools.   The  measure  -  which  would  out  law  conspicuous  religious  clothing  and  symbols  in  classrooms  -  goes  to  the  Senate,  where  little  opposition  is  expected.  Its  implementation  is  expected  in  September  at  the  begin  ning  of  the  new  school  year.   The  bill  states:  “In  schools,  junior  high  schools  and  high  schools,  signs   and  dress  that  conspicuously  show  the  religious  affiliation  of  students  are   forbidden.”   It  would  not  apply  to  students  in  private  schools  or  to  French  schools   in  other  countries.  Sanctions  for   refusing  to  remove  conspicuous  reli  gious  signs  and  clothing  would  range  from  a  warning  to  temporary  suspen  sion  from  school  to  expulsion.   French  leaders  hope  a  law  will  quell  the  debate  over  headscarves  that  has  divided  France  since  1989,  when  two  young  girls  were  expelled  from   their  school  in  Creil,  outside  Paris,  for  wearing  headscarves.  Scores  more  have  been  expelled  since  then.   The  government  argues  that  a  law  is  needed  to  protect  France’s  secular  traditions  and  to  ward  off  rising  Islamic  fundamentalism.   The  ban  applies  to  kippas  and  large  Christian  crosses  as  well  as  the   headscarf.  French  leaders  view  the  ban  as  a  vital  antidote  to  rising  Mus  lim  fundamentalism  and  growing  risks  to  France’s  secular  underpin  nings.   “It  is  time  for  the  republic  to  set  clear,  practical  and  operational  lim  its,”  said  French  Prime  Minister  Jean  Pierre  Raffarin  as  he  opened  the   debate  on  the  bill.   However,  critics  of  the  new  law  warn  of  a  possible  backlash.  Centrist  leader  Francois  Bayrou  said  the  law  would  be  a  “magnificent  present”  for  Muslim  fundamentalists,  while  soci  ologist  Farhad  Khosrokhavar  said  it  will  be  “the  beginning  of  the  problem”.

"  Faith,  fundamentalism  and  antisemitism   VIEWPOINT   DAVID  KNOLL   There  is  no  engagement   to  be  had  with   fundamentalists,   whether  Christian  or   Muslim,  because  their   approach  to  religion  and  problem-solving  admits  only  of  absolutes.  For  such  fundamentalists  Jewish  precepts  are  necessarily  wrong.   Fundamentalism  and  anti   semitism  are  both  getting  a  lot  of  press  lately,  but  not  together.  They  should  be.  Here’s  why.   First,  Islamic  fundamentalism  needs  to  be  understood  in  order  to  be  dealt  with  effectively.  Last  month,  at  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  plenum,  Professor  Clive  Kessler  out  lined  the  differences  between  “gentle”  and  “ungentle  Islam”.   One  of  the  themes  that  Professor   Kessler  developed  was  that  only  a  minority  of  Muslims  engage  inclusive  ly  with  modernity.  For  with  moderni  ty  often  comes  a  commitment  to  respectful  pluralism  (also  known  as  multiculturalism),  which  allows  no  religion  or  race  any  mastery  over  any  other.  Ungentle  Islam  however  sees  itself  as  superseding  -  indeed  having  mastery  over  -  both  Judaism  and  Christianity.   To  much  of  the  Islamic  world,  Christianity  is  seen  as  a  compromised  monotheism,  and  the  persistence  of  Judaism,  having  been  once  superseded  by  Christ  and  then  superseded  by  Mohammed,  is  puzzling.  The  idea  that  in  a  pluralistic  world  each  religious   people  can  have  autonomy  but  not  mastery  over  the  others  is  a  concept  with  which  most  of  the  Islamic  world  is  ill  at  ease.   Meanwhile  “gentle  Islam”,  the  minority  version,  struggles  to  come  to  grips  with  the  concept  of  modernity  and  pluralism.  This  struggle  was  suc  cinctly  explained  by  Irshad  Manji  who  toured  Australia  recently  presenting   her  new  book  The  Trouble  with  Islam.  One  of  her  themes  was  that  Muslims  who  live  in  western  democracies  are   able  to  pursue  the  concept  of  jihad  and  survive  very  well  in  a  pluralistic,  dem  ocratic  environment.  Her  faith,  she  felt,  was  not  compromised  by  acknowledging  the  right  of  other  faiths  to  live  alongside  hers.  Manji  is  an  out  standing  intellect,  and  a  welcome  exponent  of  what  Professor  Kessler  would  call  “gentle  Islam”.   It  was,  however,  at  the  AGM  of  the  NSW  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  where  some  of  these  concepts  were  taken  beyond  any  particular  religion.  Dr  Simon  Longstaff  of  the  St  James  Ethics  Centre  was  the  keynote  speaker.  His  topic  was  “Faith  and  fundamental  ism”.  If  I  understood  Dr  Longstaff  cor   rectly,  his  thesis  was  that  people  of  faith  are  prepared  to  live  with  ambiguity  and  uncertainty,  and  therefore  are  willing  to  respect   human  difference  while   being  strengthened  in  their  particular  faith.  By  con  trast,  fundamentalists  allow  for  no  uncertainty  or  ambi  guity.  For  them  their  reli  gion  provided  absolute   answers  which  removed  uncertainties,  and  discon  nected  troubling  questions   from  their  lives.  For  a  fundamentalist   there  is  no  room  for  any  “other”  answer  to  life’s  most  difficult  questions.   If  faith  is  a  tool  for  managing  ambi  guity  and  uncertainty,  then  funda  mentalists  are  not  necessarily  people  of  faith.  Dr  Longstaff  thus  posed  a  chal  lenge  which  must  be  taken  up  by  all  faith  communities.  And  the  more  per  plexing  we  are,  the  more  it  is  essential  that  we  encourage  people  of  faith  to  engage  with  us.  In  Dr  Longstaff’s  model,  and  according  to  Professor  Kessler’s  prescription,  the  people  we  can  and  need  to  engage  with  are  those  who  are  comfortable  with  ambiguity  and  uncertainty  and  therefore  respect  ful  of  pluralism  and  modernity.   There  is  no  engagement  to  be  had  with  fundamentalists,  whether  Christ  ian  or  Muslim,  because  their  approach  to  religion  and  problem-solving  admits  only  of  absolutes.  For  such  fun  damentalists  Jewish  precepts  are  nec  essarilywrong.   Even  as  Christian  fundamentalists  and  Muslim  fundamentalists  will  not  agree  with  each  other,  because  each  of  them  will  not  admit  the  possibility  that   the  other’s  fundamentalism  warrants  respect,  both  will  agree  on  the  percep  tion  of  the  error  of  the  Jewish  way.   And  fundamentalists  do  not  have  to  be  labelled  religious  at  all.   The  anti-globalisation  movement  is  a  good  example  of  secular  funda  mentalism.  Mark  Strauss,  writing  in  Foreign  Policy  (November  2003),  wrote  an  outstanding  article  entitled  “Anti  globalism’s  Jewish  problem”.  He  reminds  us  that  deregulation  of  inter  national  economic  links  took  place  in  the  1980s  and  1990s,  and  resulted  in  selective  economic  growth.  Nations  that  deregulated  prospered  more  than   those  that  did  not.  Israel,  and  Jewish  business  interests  in  the  deregulated  new  world,  prospered.  The  Islamic  world  did  not.  Europe’s  economies  did  not  progress  or  prosper  as  quickly  as   the  United  States.   The  anti-globalisation  movement  asks  itself  rhetorically  “Where  are  Jews  the  strongest?”  They  answer:  “In  the   United  States  and  Israel.”  Then  anti  globalisation  activists  draw  a  correla  tion  and  indeed  a  causative  difference   between  nations  that  give  Jews  free  dom,  and  nations  which  have  pros  pered  “at  the  expense  of  others”.   Argues  Strauss:  “Throughout  the  Middle  East,  where  economic  growth  remains  stagnant  everywhere  but  Israel,  Islamists  and  secular  national  ists  alike  portray  globalisation  as  the  latest  in  a  series  of  US-Zionist  plots  to  subjugate  the  Arab  world  under  west   ern  economic  control  and  erase  its  cul  tural  borders.”   Anti-globalisation  activists  thus  engage  in  an  antisemitism  as  virile  and  fundamentalist  as  the  antisemitism  practised  by  Christian  and  Muslim  fundamentalists.  Thus  one  can  draw  out  that  a  great  threat  to  Jewish  free  dom  is  the  growth  of  fundamentalism.  There  is  no  such  threat  inherent  in  the  growth  of  respectful  faiths.   The  policy  lessons  are:  (i)  that  we  must  be  active  in  our  pursuit  of  plural  ist  western  democratic  values,  with  its  inherent  uncertainties,  and  (ii)  that  we  must  actively  build  our  alliances  with  serious  faith  communities,  while  care  fully  distinguishing  the  ungentle  from  the  gentle,  the  people  of  faith  from  the  purveyors  of  fundamentalism.

"  THE  RADICAL  LIFE  OF  SHEIKH  YASSIN   1936:  Ahmed  Yassin  is  born  in  a  village  near  Ashkelon.   1948:  He  and  his  family  are  uprooted  to  Gaza  along  with  thousands  of  other   Arab  refugees.  Following  a  sports  acci  dent  aged  12  (some  say  aged  16)  Yassin  is  confined  to  a  wheelchair.   1950s:  The  man  Israeli  officials  dubbed  ""the  Palestinian  Osama  bin  Laden”  joins  the  Muslim  Brotherhood  while  studying  at  Cairo’s  Al-Azhar  Uni  versity.  In  his  early  20s,  Yassin  begins  speaking  out  against  plans  to  impose  international  supervision  of  the  Gaza  Strip.   1965:  His  fierce  speeches  lead  Egypt  ian  authorities  to  jail  him  for  a  month.   Post-1967f  After  the  Six-Day  War,  Yassin  delivers  speeches  calling  on  Arabs  and  Muslims  to  resist  Israel's  occupation.   1979:  Yassin  founds  the  Islamic  Organ  isation,  a  body  Israeli  military  authori  ties  initially  hoped  would  reduce  the  political  influence  of  Fatah.   1984:  Yassin  is  jailed  for  13  years  for  leading  a  hostile  organisation  and  stockpiling  weapons.  He  is  freed  just  a  year  later  in  a  prisoner  exchange.   1987:  Yassin  founds  his  own  Muslim  Brotherhood-inspired  movement,  Hamas,  which  rivals  the  Palestinian  Authority.  Hamas’  purpose  was  (and  remains)  to  wage  jihad  against  Israel  and  replace  it  with  a  single  Palestinian  state  from  the  Jordan  River  to  the  Mediterranean  Sea.   1989:  Israel  arrests  Yassin  along  with  some  200  Hamas  members  in  a  major  round-up.  He  is  sentenced  to  life  in  prison  by  a  military  court  after  pleading  guilty  to  manslaughter  charges  in  the  slayings  of  four  Palestinians  accused  of  collaborating  with  Israel.   1997:  Israel  frees  Yassin  in  exchange  for  two  Mossad  agents  held  by  Jordan  after  a  botched  attempt  on  fellow  Hamas  leader  Khaled  Mashaal.   2000:  Hamas  leads  the  intifada  in  the  use  of  bus  bombings.  Its  highest-profile  attack  was  the  Pesach  massacre  at  the  Park  Hotel  in  Netanya  in  2002,  the  deadliest  single  terror  attack  in  Israel  in  three  decades,  killing  29  Israelis.   2003:  Yassin  survives  an  IAF  bombing  of  a  building  where  several  Hamas  lead  ers  were  meeting,  with  only  a  small  wound  on  his  hand.   2004:  Three  IAF  missiles  kill  Yassin  as  he  leaves  a  Gaza  mosque.

"  Ushering  in  Chanukah,  tolerance  in  Indonesia   ALANA  ROSENBAUM   A  MAJOR  regional  conference  for  religious  leaders  held  in  Indonesia  began  with  a  plea  for  ethnic  and  religious  tolerance  by  the  country’s  leader,  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoy   ono,  and  concluded  with  a   Chanukah  prayer.   Peta  Pellach,  the  only  Jewish  member  of  the  Australian  delega  tion,  wrapped  up  the  Dialogue  on  Inter-faith  Co-operation  last  week  at  the  Yogyakarta  palace  of  Sultan  Hamengkubuwono  X  with  a  prayer  to  usher  in  the  Festival  of  Lights.   Pellach  said  the  sultan  denied  permission  for  the  chanukiah  to  be  lit  at  his  home,  but  agreed  to  the  Chanukah  prayer  on  the  condition  that  it  was  recited  in  English.   Pellach  was  one  of  10  Australian  delegates  -  six  Christians  (includ  ing  Archbishop  George  Pell),  a  Muslim,  a  Buddhist,  a  Hindu  and  a  Jew  -  to  take  part  in  the  conference  for  members  of  the  Association  of  South  East  Asian  Nations  ASEAN  as  well  as  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  Papua  New  Guinea.

The  only  other  Jewish  represen  tative  was  Progressive  Rabbi  Michael  Weisser,  who  was  part  of  the  New  Zealand  delegation.   Pellach  said  that  many  of  the  delegates  told  her  they  had  never  even  met  a  Jew  prior  to  thp   conference.   “I  felt  very  welcome  even  though  I  felt  at  times  like  an  oddi  ty,”  she  told  the  AJN  on  her  return.   “The  Catholic  representative  of  Indonesia  called  me  ‘daughter  of   Zion’.”   Pellach  was  frustrated  that  the  issue  of  worldwide  conflict  between  Muslims  and  Jews  was  not  even  broached  at  the  conference,   Peta  PeBacfc  “Jusi  (he  veiy  fad  that   delegates  were  exposed  to  a  couple  of  lews  was  a  step  in  the  ri$rt  (erection.”   but  said  that  her  very  presence  at  a  predominantly  Muslim,  male  dominated  forum  was  a  sign  of   progress.   “Just  the  very  fact  that  delegates  were  exposed  to  a  couple  of  Jews  was  a  step  in  the  right  direction.

"  Belgian  right-wing   political  party  banned   PHILIP  CARMEL   PARIS  -  Belgian  Jews  are  worried  that  a  court  decision  to  criminalise  one  of   Europe’s  strongest  far-right  parties  might  see  it  bounce  back  stronger   than  ever.   The  decision  by  the  High  Court  in   Brussels  last  week  to  convict  the  Vlaams  Blok  came  after  the  court   found  that  the  group  had  infringed  upon  Belgian  law  by  continuing  to  advocate  a  racist  and  xenophobic  platform.   The  ruling  means  that  under  its  current  structure,  the  Vlaams  Blok   could  be  stripped  of  its  rights  to  state  funding  and  television  access,  thereby  forcing  it  to  disband.   The  racist  policy  in  question  con  cerns  the  party’s  advocacy  of  compul  sory  repatriation  for  “large  groups  of  non-European  immigrants”,  a  plat  form  seen  as  targeting  principally  Muslim  migrants  in  Belgium.   As  the  largest  political  group  on  the  Antwerp  City  Council,  the  party  has  only  been  kept  from  political  power  by  an  unofficial  agreement  between  all  major  parties  to  refuse  to  co-operate  with  it.   Nevertheless,  even  after  the  lower  court  ruling,  the  party  polled  close  to  a  quarter  of  the  votes  in  Flanders  in  European  elections  in  June,  and  opin   ion  polls  regularly  show  it  to  be  the  leading  party  in  the  region.   The  party  is  also  expected  to  change  its  name,  a  tactic  which,  at  least  in  the  short  term,  will  enable  it  to  avoid  the  ban.   Jewish  groups  though  are  not  con  vinced  by  such  changes,  citing  long  standing  links  between  fascist  elements  during  World  War  II  and  extreme  Flemish  nationalist  groups,  the  precursors  of  the  Vlaams  Blok.   According  to  Claude  Marinower,  a  Jewish  member  of  parliament  from  Antwerp,  the  court  ruling  would  make  the  Vlaams  Blok  “change  their  wrapping  but  not  their  ideology”.   Marinower  praised  the  court  deci  sion  because  it  established  that  “free  dom  of  speech  has  its  limits”,  although  he  said  “it  remains  to  be  seen  whether  they’re  really  going  to  change  their  behaviour”.   The  party’s  strong  anti-Muslim  line  has  worried  community  leaders  in  Antwerp  with  persistent  rumours  that  members  of  Antwerp’s  fervently  Ortho  dox  community  have  voted  for  the  Vlaams  Blok  in  recent  local  elections.   About  40,000  Jews  live  in  Belgium  -  most  of  them  in  Antwerp  and  Brus  sels.  and  national  elections.   “The  danger  is  that  they’re  very  careful  not  to  do  anything  openly   antisemitic,  Keeser  said.

"  Claim  of  Israeli  involvement   in  Sudan  outrageous,  says  MP   MICHAEL  CAVANAGH   A  SUPPORTER  of  the  Palestinian   cause  has  sprung  to  Israel’s  defence  over  attempts  to  link  it  with  the  humanitarian  crisis  in  Sudan.   Labor’s  Multicultural  Affairs   spokesperson  Laurie  Ferguson,  whose  Sydney  seat  of  Reid  includes  the  coun  try’s  largest  Muslim  electorate,  con   demned  Sudanese  President  Omar  al-Bashir  in  Federal  Parliament   Supporting  a  motion  by  MP  Michael  Danby,  he  described  the  Sudanese  leader  as  “responsible  for  more  deaths  than  Slobodan  Milosevic,  Saddam  Hussein  and  Pol  Pot”.   Danby’s  motion  urged  the  govern  ment  to  commit  personnel  to  a  United  Nations  peacekeeping  force  and  to  assist  the  prosecution  of  perpetrators   of  war  crimes  in  the  devastated  nation.   Ferguson  took  the  Sudanese  to  task  over  “outrageous  allegations”  that  For  eign  Minister  Mustafa  Osman  Ismail  told  the  Arab  League  that  “Israel  is  behind  this  insurgency”.   Rebel  leaders  have  dismissed  the   Laurie  Ferguson   allegations  that  there  was  contact  with  Israel,  claiming  it  was  an  attempt  to  stir  up  Muslim  public  opinion.   The  Arab  League  has  opposed  UN  intervention  in  Sudan,  arguing  that  it   should  be  allowed  to  resolve  the  catas   trophe,  which  has  seen  50,000  killed   and  one  million  homeless.   “The  notion  that  the  UN  has  no   right  to  push  for  action  to  disarm  mili  tias  is  preposterous,”  Ferguson  said.   Ferguson  has  also  been  critical  of  attempts  by  Sudanese  officials  to  por  tray  the  country  as  a  friend  of  the  US  after  September  11  by  “rushing”  to  sign  a  condolence  book  at  the  US  Embassy.   “It  was  a  typical  attempt  by  the  gov  ernment  to  change  its  pariah  status  from  when  it  harboured  Bin  Laden   and  [was]  attacked  by  the  US  in  regard  to  alleged  chemical  weapons  work.  That  attempt  by  Sudan  to  change  its  spots  has  been  unsuccessful”   In  moving  the  motion,  Danby  said  firm  action  has  to  be  taken  immediate  ly  if  a  disaster  similar  to  that  which  occurred  in  Rwanda  10  years  ago,  when  800,000  people  were  massacred,   is  to  be  avoided.   “What  is  happening  in  Darfur  is  not  a  natural  disaster,  it  is  an  entirely  man-made  catastrophe,  brought  about  by  the  Islamist  military  dictator  ship  of  General  Omar  Bashir  in  Sudan,”  he  stated.

"  TOO  PRO-ISRAEL   WASHINGTON  -  The  Bush  administra  tion’s  support  for  Israel  boosts  al  Qaeda,  a  former  CIA  official  said.

"  Danby,  King:  Hicks  deserves  justice  -  despite  his  antisemitic  remarks   MICHAEL  CAVANAGH   IN  letters  to  his  family  written  before  being  captured  by  US  troops  in  Afghanistan,  Australian  David  Hicks  accuses  the  “Jews’  propaganda  war  machine”  of  attempting  to  divide  the  Muslim  world  and  having  them  “think  bad  things”  about  Osama  bin   Laden  and  the  Taliban.   “If  the  thinking  and  training  spread  throughout  the  Muslim  world,  the  Western  Jewish  domination  is  finished,”  wrote  Hicks,  who  is  incar  cerated  at  Guantanamo  Bay,  Cuba.   He  also  writes  about  spending   time  at  different  centres  where  he  learned  about  the  Koran  and  how  to  preach  it,  while  also  being  instructed  in  fighting.   Despite  being  “no  naive  innocent”,  Hicks  and  fellow-Australian  inmate  Mamdouh  Habib  are  entitled  to  jus  tice,  Member  for  Melbourne  Ports  Michael  Danby  told  Federal  Parlia   ment  last  week.   He  and  Liberal  Member  for  Went   worth  Peter  King  told  parliament  in  separate  speaking  slots  that  there  must  be  a  response  in  light  of  claims  that  Hicks  and  Habib  have  been  tor  tured.   Several  former  Guantanamo  Bay  inmates  who  recendy  returned  to   Michael   Danby   Britain  allege  that  the  pair  have  been  abused  while  being  held  by  the  US  military.   Danby  and  King  represent  the  two  largest  Jewish  electorates  in  the  coun  try.  During  debate  on  proposed  anti  terror  laws,  Danby  argued  that  the  trials  of  both  men  be  brought  for  ward  as  soon  as  possible.   “We  must  ensure  that  the  Aus   tralian  Government  sees  that  they  are  treated  in  a  humane  way,”  he  said.  “However,  no  Australian  who  values  the  pluralist  tolerant  democracy  that  we  have  built  in  this  country,  which  al-Qaeda  would  like  to  destroy,  should  have  any  sympathy  for  them.”   He  based  this  on  attempts  to  “glamorise”  the  former  South  Aus  tralian,  who  turned  29  last  week,  in  the  documentary  The  President  versus  David  Hicks,  which  was  screened  ear   Peter  King   lier  this  year  on  SBS.   In  the  film  Hicks’  father  Terry  Hicks  retraces  his  son’s  journey  through  Pakistan  and  Afghanistan,  while  letters  from  the  detainee  to  his  family,  written  in  August  2000  prior  to  his  capture,  are  read  -  including  the  derogatory  remarks  against  the  Jews.   King,  who  will  not  represent  the  Liberals  at  the  next  election  after  los  ing  a  preselection  battle  to  investment  banker  Malcolm  Turnbull,  urged  that  an  Australian  be  involved  in  any  US  investigation  into  the  torture  claims.   “It  is  high  time  these  men  were  charged  and  brought  to  trial,  not  just   a  trial  but  a  fair  trial.  It  has  been  too  long  since  they  have  been  incarcerat  ed  without  charge  and  as  Australian  citizens  their  trial  ought  to  occur,”  he  told  parliament.

"  Protest  mars  lecture  on  terror   MELISSA  SINGER   PROTESTORS  representing  a  student  socialist  movement  threatened  to  dis  rupt  a  lecture  by  American  political  scientist  Dr  Daniel  Pipes  at  the  Uni  versity  of  Melbourne  last  week.   About  30  protestors  from  the  Mel  bourne  University  Peace  Group  wielded  placards  bearing  anti-US  slo  gans  such  as  “Bush  is  a  murderer”  and  “Free  Palestine”,  and  caused  disrup  tions  throughout  Dr  Pipes’  lecture  on  “Militant  Islam  and  the  war  on  terror”   When  the  outbursts  escalated,  sev  eral  protestors  were  escorted  from  the  venue  by  security  staff.   Dr  Pipes  is  director  of  the  Philadel  phia-based  Middle  East  Forum,  an  independent  think-tank  that  pro   motes  US  interests  in  the  Middle  East.   He  declared  that  the  “war  on  ter   ror”  is  a  misnomer  which  is  effectively  “handicapping”  the  West.  Rather,  he  said,  it  is  a  war  on  “militant  Islam”.   “Terrorism  cannot  be  an  enemy;  terrorism  is  a  pattern.  One  cannot  make  war  on  a  military  pattern.  One   can  only  make  war  on  an  enemy”   “The  goal  in  this  war  must  be,  first,  the  reduction,  marginalisation  and  crushing  of  this  totalitarian  ideology.  Secondly,  it  must  be  the  rehabilitation  of  anti-Islamism...  what  must  replace   this  radical  form  of  Islam  is  a  moder  ate,  modem  and  good-neighbourly   form  of  Islam  ...  and  that  must  come  from  within.”   j  “Tiie  ‘war  on  terror1  is  a  1  misnomer  which  is   effectively   ‘handicapping’the  West.  It  is  a  war  on  ‘militant  Islam'.”   DR  DANIEL  PIPES   I  Director,  Middle  East  Forum   While  Dr  Pipes  acknowledged  the  role  of  the  West  in  guiding  the  Muslim  world  towards  moderation,  he  stressed  the  need  for  the  non-Muslim  world  to  acknowledge  the  latent  dan   gers  in  everyday  Islam.   “Terrorism  is  the  symptom  of  something  greater.  The  threat  to  our  selves  lies  less  in  terrorism,  against   which  we  have  institutions.  We  know  how  to  deal  with  violence  and  crimi  nality  and  warfare  ...  but  there  is  another  side,  a  non-terrorist  side,  a  non-violent  side  ...  which  is  political,  against  which  we  have  few  defences.”   The  author  of  14  books  on  topics  including  the  Middle  East  and  Islam,  Dr  Pipes  is  a  respected  authority  on  Middle  Eastern  history  and  security  and  a  columnist  for  the  Jerusalem  Post  and  New  York  Post  He  was  appointed  to   the  board  of  the  US  Institute  of  Peace  in   April  by  US  President  George  Bush.

"  UNDERSTANDING  OTHERS   I  WRIIb  in  regard  to  a  speech  by  Central  Synagogue  Rabbi  Levi  Wolff  in  which  he  referred  to  Iran’s  rejection  of  Israel’s  offer  of  help  following  the  devastating  earthquake  in  Bam.   He  said  the  rejection  illustrated   how  deeply  Jews  are  hated  by  Mus  lims,  and  that  Muslims  would  rather  lose  their  women  and  children  than  have  them  saved  by  a  Jew.   Iran’s  decision  was  obviously  polit  ical.  Nowhere  in  the  Koran  does  it  say  that  Muslims  hate  Jews.   I  love  going  to  Central  on  Friday  nights,  but  as  a  Jew,  I  expect  the  rabbi  to  teach  tolerance  and  peace,  not  incite  racial  distrust.  If  such  a  speech  was  made  by  a  Muslim  about  Jews,  there  would  be  an  enormous  outcry.  Surely  it’s  time  to  understand,  not  undermine,  “the  other”.

"  Historic  UN  resolution  condemns   antisemitism   URIEL  HEILMAN   NEW  YORK  -  The  Third  Committee  of  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  has  for  the  first  time  passed  a  resolution  on  Monday  condemning  antisemitism  as  part  of  a  broader  res  olution  against  religious  intolerance.   Israeli  officials  said  the  inclusion  of  a  reference  to  antisemitism  in  what  has  become  an  annual  UN  resolution   on  religious  intolerance  constitutes  a  historic  breakthrough.   The  resolution  will  now  go  to  the  plenum  of  the  General  Assembly,  where  it  is  expected  to  be  ratified.   The  resolution  passed  despite  efforts  by  Arab  countries  to  omit  any  references  to  anti-Jewish  bigotry  amid  references  to  Islamophobia  and  Christianophobia.  In  years  past,  the   resolution  made  no  mention  of  anti  semitism.   In  the  resolution,  the  Third  Com  mittee  of  the  UN  General  Assembly  said  it  “recognises  with  deep  concern   the  overall  rise  in  instances  of  intoler   ance  and  violence  directed  against  members  of  many  religious  commu  nities  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  including  cases  motivated  by  Islamo  phobia,  antisemitism  and  Chris  tianophobia”.   In  previous  years,  Israel  had  abstained  from  supporting  the  reso   lution  due  to  its  failure  to  mention   antisemitism.  Many  pointed  to  the  omission  as  one  of  many  signs  that  the  United  Nations  is  hostile  toward   Israel  and  the  Jewish  people.   However,  in  2004  UN  Secretary  General  Kofi  Annan  spearheaded  a  new  willingness  on  the  part  of  the  international  body  to  confront  anti   semitism.  In  two  landmark  speeches  given  by  Annan,  in  January  and  June  of  this  year,  he  has  spoken  out  force  fully  against  worldwide  antisemitism  and  has  urged  supporters  of  the  Palestinians  not  to  use  their  ideology  as  a  platform  for  promoting  the  hatred  of  Jews.   Against  this  background,  Israel  mounted  a  concerted  campaign  to   have  antisemitism  included  in  the  annual  resolution,  and  officials  said  they  were  pleased  with  the  inclusive  resolution’s  unanimous  passage.  American  Jewish  organisations  were  also  actively  engaged  in  the  effort.   “This  was  a  historic  breakthrough  for  Israel  in  this  organisation  which  very  often  does  not  do  what  is  right,”   said  Israel’s  ambassador  to  the  United  Nations,  Dan  Gillerman.  “It’s  been  a  very,  very  uphill  battle.”   Gillerman  credited  the  European  Union  (EU)  and  the  Dutch  president  of  the  EU,  Jan  Peter  Balkenende,  for  pushing  for  the  antisemitism  clause  in  the  face  of  strong  opposition  from   Arab  and  Muslim  countries.  Other   officials  said  that  Germany  was  also  very  forceful  in  its  talks  with  Arab  and  Muslim  diplomats.   Diplomatic  observers  at  the  UN   said  that  the  Arab  states  decided  to   back  the  resolution  for  fear  of  being  depicted  as  refusing  to  condemn  reli  gious  intolerance  and  xenophobia.   Gillerman  also  said  Israeli  mobili  sation  on  the  issue,  which  made  it  a  top  priority  at  the  Foreign  Ministry,  helped  overcome  Arab  efforts  to  “dilute  and  poison”  the  resolution.

Production  of  the  film  has  been  postponed  to  June  2005.

Sheikh  Hilaly,  most  of  the  time,  he  goes  overboard  in  his  statements  and   sometimes  there  are  a  lot  of  contradic  tions  and  outrageous  declarations...   “Not  many  Muslims  in  Australia  agree  with  him...  because  this  is  not  proper,  particularly  in  the  multicultur  alism  we  live  in,  in  Australia.”   He  went  on  to  say  that  Sheikh  Hilaly  was  divisive  and  should  not  be  the  Mufti  representing  the  Australian  Muslim  community.

"  Life  in   Baghdad  was  deceptively  idyllic  -  a   child-oriented  society  on  one  hand,  but   harsh  on  the  other,  with  public  executions  commonplace.   MAY  STEIN  reflects  on  life  as  an  Iraqi  Jew.   |  Murder  was  part  of  life.  |  Executed  bodies  were  !  left  hanging  in  the  City  |  Square  for  everyone  to  I  gloat  over.  A  Muslim   j  father  would  kill  his  own   |  daughter  for  arriving   I  home  late,  rather  than   take  the  chance  of  being  disgraced  by  her   presumed  action.   iWAS  the  middle  child  of  a  fami   ly  of  five.  Our  house  was  in  the  old  part  of  Baghdad,  where  cars  couldn’t  negotiate  the  lanes.   Our  home  consisted  of  a  court  yard  with  access  to  a  cellar  which  served  as  a  refuge  from  the  fierce  dry   heat  of  summer  and  the  sand-storms.   The  rooms  had  stone  floors  cov   ered  with  Persian  carpets  which  were  removed  during  the  hot  months.  The  roof  was  a  terrace  in  which  the  family  slept  during  summer.  I  remember  the  magic  of  the  moonlit,  starry  nights.   We  kept  a  kosher  house.  Friday  nights  were  special.  Our  Friday  night  prayer  was  Eshet  Chayil  in  honour  of  Mother.  We  lined  up  and  respectfully  kissed  our  parents’  hands.   The  chicken  was  taken  to  the  shochet.  From  the  one  chicken,  Moth  er  provided  soup  and  okra,  which  was  believed  to  be  an  aphrodisiac  -  maybe  to  help  for  the  Shabbes  mitzvah!   She  stuffed  the  chicken  with  rice,  sultanas  and  almonds  and  left  it   cooking  the  whole  night  on  a  low  flame  with  a  dozen  eggs  in  readiness  for  Shabbat.  The  eggs  became  brown.   For  the  seder  we  ate  rice  -  for  us  it   is  permitted  -  and  baked  our  own   matzah.   Rosh  Hashanah  and  Yom  Kippur  were  celebrated  with  passion.  We  dressed  European-style  (all  home  made),  but  my  mother’s  generation  wore  fancy  brocade  shawls  with  veils.  When  shopping  at  the  souk,  a  black  abbaya  with  veil  was  worn  by  older   women.  The  men  wore  a  Turkish   style  fez.  That  later  changed  to  straight  black  hats,  sidaras.   I  attended  a  Jewish  school  -  the  Laura  Kadoorie  Alliance  Israelite  Uni   verselle,  separate  for  boys  and  girls.  We  learned  French,  Arabic,  Hebrew  and  English.  We  studied  Moliere,  Shakespeare  and  Omar  Khayyam.   We  conversed  in  our  dialect  of  Jew  ish  Arabic,  with  French  words  inte  grated  into  the  jargon.  There  were  sayings  to  fit  every  occasion,  such  as  “A  father  cared  for  1000  children,  but  1000  children  could  not  take  care  of  one  father”.   It  was  the  norm  to  have  lots  of  children.  Boys  were  favoured.  It  was  Siman  Tov  when  a  boy  was  bom,  while  for  a  girl  Mazal  Tov  and  “Bet   ter  luck  next  time”.   Boys  were  potential  earners  and  perpetuated  the  family  name,  while  girls  were  a  risk  and  needed  dowries.  The  fairer  the  skin,  the  better  the  odds.  Husbands-to-be  paid  the  dowry  for  what  was  considered  a  beautiful  girl.   My  mother  was  born  in  1902.  Her   father  died  when  she  was  two.  She  lived  with  the  whole  clan.  Friends  and  arch  enemies  were  all  from  within.   Her  older  sister  married  a  man   who  became  Chief  Rabbi  of  Baghdad.  Her  other  sister  married  a  religious  man  who  took  his  family  to  Palestine   -  unusual  at  the  time.   My  father  came  from  India  with  the  British  Army  during  World  War  I.  He  was  of  Iraqi  origin;  many  Jews  had  left  Iraq  in  search  of  trade  and  settled  in  India,  Singapore  and  China.   They  established  a  Jewish  life  while  enjoying  the  privileges  of  the  Euro  peans.  Among  these  were  Sir  Albert  David  Sassoon  and  Sir  Elly  Kadoorie.   Superstition  was  prevalent,  partic  ularly  fear  of  the  “evil  eye”.  Sacrificial  offerings  for  births,  bar  mitzvahs  and  recovery  from  illness  was  common.  Kapparot  was  performed  and  the  sac   rificial  lamb  or  chicken  was  distrib  uted  to  the  needy.   Another  ritual  was  the  nuptial  night  after  seven  nights  of  feasting,  one  of  which  was  Henna  Night,  when  the  bride’s  fingers  were  painted  and  imprinted  chamsa-style  as  a  precau  tion  against  the  “evil  eye”.   On  the  seventh  night,  they  put  the  bride  and  groom  in  the  bedroom,  usually  at  the  home  of  the  groom’s  parents.  When  the  evidence  on  the  sheet  emerged,  the  women  made  a  customary  noise  to  indicate  that  the   simcha  had  been  consummated.   For  bereavements,  the  men  hired  chest-beaters  and  moaners  to  help  with  the  proceedings.   The  family  of  Lord  Maurice  Saatchi  of  the  famed  Saatchi  &amp;  Saatchi  Advertising  Agency  were  our  neighbours  in  Baghdad.   We  wanted  to  be  part  of  the  real  world.  I  recall  my  brother  -  who  later  acquired  a  Ph.D  at  MIT  in  Boston  -  gathering  the  neighbourhood  to  tell   us  about  Hiroshima  in  1945.   At  certain  levels,  Jews  and  Muslims  seemed  to  live  well  together.  There   May  Stein’s  mother  Naima  Ezekiel  (seated),  father  David  Ezekiel,  grandmother  Farah  Toeg,  brother  Fred  and  sister  Clairette.   was  a  certain  understanding  anu  uie   atrical  show  of  solidarity.   It  even  fooled  my  unde,  Chief  Rabbi  of  Baghdad,  who  assured  us  that  all  would  be  well  for  Jews  in  Iraq,  in  order  to  stop  us  leaving  in  1948.   He  said  he  had  the  assurance  of  Crown  Prince  Abd  El-Ilah.  Little  did  the  Crown  Prince  know  that  10  years  later,  he  and  King  Faisal  would  be  murdered  by  their  own  people.   Murder  was  part  of  life.  Executed  bodies  were  left  hanging  in  the  City  Square  for  everyone  to  witness.  A  Muslim  father  would  kill  his  own   daughter  for  arriving  home  late,  rather  than  take  the  chance  of  being  disgraced  by  her  presumed  action.

During  the  British  occupation  after  World  War  I  the  Jews  of  Iraq  enjoyed  freedom  and  thrived  They  were  affluent  and  held  key  positions  in  government,  finance,  banking,  medicine  and  the  judiciary.   This  antagonised  many  Arabs  and  they  executed  many  innocent  indi  viduals  without  trial.  They  picked  their  victims  at  random  and  accused  them  of  being  Zionist  spies.   Our  Zionist  teaching  was  strictiy  underground  for  fear  of  being  arrest  ed  or  shot  They  made  life  so  intoler  able  that  in  1952  the  vast  majority  of  Iraq’s  Jews,  120,400,  left  for  Israel.   They  travelled  on  the  air-lifts  called  “Ezra  and  Nehemia”,  symbolis  ing  the  return  of  the  Jews  from  the  Babylonian  Exile  and  leaving  their  homes  and  possessions  behind.   They  became  denationalised,  giv  ing  up  their  claim  to  be  Iraqi,  but  were  gready  relieved  to  be  free.   In  1982,  300  Jews  were  still  living  in  Iraq,  and  that  number  continued  dwindling.  The  remaining  Jews  -  including  those  with  Muslim  spouses  -  have  been  airlifted  to  Israel  during  the  past  nine  months.  The  Babylon  ian  Jewish  era  is  finally  extinct.   May  Stein  (nee  Ezekiel)  settled  in  London   in  1948,  then  moved  to  Israel,  before  coming  to  Sydney  in  1959,  where  she   married  Fred  Stein.

"  WORST  FORM  OF  GOVERNMENT   THE  ICJ  decision  on  Israel’s  security  fence  can  only  be  understood  by  refer  ence  to  Mahathir’s  comments  at  last  year’s  Organisation  of  Islamic  Coun  tries  conference,  that  1.3  billion  Mus   lims  and  56  countries  could  “make  or   break  international  organisations”.   The  ICJ  gave  the  judgement  it  had  been  instructed  to  give  by  a  UN  Gen  eral  Assembly  resolution  in  which  101  nations  either  voted  against  or  abstained.  The  Muslim  bloc  got  it  through,  as  it  gets  every  other  anti  Israel  resolution  through  the  General  Assembly,  which  is  little  more  than  a  glorified  opinion  poll.   If  “democracy  is  the  worst  possible  form  of  government  except  every  other  alternative  that’s  ever  been  tried”,  then  the  “democratic”  UN  is  the  worst   possible  form  of  world  government.   Democracy  doesn’t  guarantee  human  rights;  it  only  provides  a  better  soil  for  human  rights  to  flourish.  Until  the  majority  of  its  members  renounce   racism  the  UN  will  remain  one  of  the   world’s  foremost  proponents  of  anti   semitism.   JUDITH  RONA  j   Bondi,  NSW  ! ",2004-07-23
"  Christmas  displays  spark  ideological  debate   PETER  KOHN   CHRISTIANS  in  Australia  must  be  allowed  to  celebrate  Christmas  in  public  and  in  their  own  traditional  ways  -  according  to  many  leading   Jewish  authorities.   The  Jewish  leaders  are  thus  weigh  ing  in  behind  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  and  NSW  Premier  Bob  Carr  who  have  criticised  reported  munici  pal  and  corporate  attempts  to  conceal  overtly  Christian  manifestations  dur  ing  the  Christmas  season.   “Freedom  of  expression  is  some  thing  that  should  be  cherished  and  preserved  in  Australia  -  and  that  means  recognising  and  accepting  all  religions’  rights  to  publicly  display  symbols,”  the  Great  Synagogue’s  Rabbi  Mendel  Kastel  told  the  AJN.  “That’s  what’s  so  fantastic  about   Australia.”   Newly-elected  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  deputy  president  Rabbi  John  Levi  concurred.   “Religious  freedom  is  one  of  our  most  precious  gifts  and  nobody  forces   me  to  observe  Christmas.”   And  Rabbinical  Council  of  Victo  ria  president  Rabbi  Gidon  Fox  said:  ""We  live  in  a  non-Jewish  society,  in  feet,  one  that  to  all  intents  and  pur  poses  is  a  Christian  society.  If  we  want  our  own  freedom  of  expression,  we  have  to  allow  it  for  others.  As  long  as  what’s  said  is  not  against  us.”   The  controversy  flared  after  reports  in  Sydney’s  Daily  Telegraph  about  a  plan  to  curtail  the  public  displays  of  Christmas  in  the  NSW  capital  -  reports  which  have  subsequently  been  strenuously  denied  and  legally  chal  lenged.

Jeff  Fisher,  chief  executive  of  the  Oporto  group  said  that  the  chain  had  been  “guilty  of  being  over-sensitive  by  wanting  to  keep  the  decorations  to  a  general  nature.  We  tried  to  be  politi  cally  correct,  and  that  was   overzealous.”   Prime  Minister  John  Howard  also   waded  into  the  controversy,  telling  ABC  Radio  that  the  muffling  of  Christmas  displays  was  “political  cor  rectness  from  central  casting”.   “I  have  never  met  a  Jewish  person  or  a  Muslim  Australian  who  wants  us  to  stop  celebrating  Christmas.  You  see,  this  is  the  ridiculous  thing  about  this  blanding  out  of  any  kind  of  distinctive  identity  that  we  might  have,”  Howard   said.   “Christmas  is  not  only  a  religious  festival,  but  it’s  also  part  of  the  history  and  the  culture  of  this  country...

"  Jewish,  Muslim  tea  for  two   ORYANA  KAUFMAN   THE  friendship  that  grew  between  a  Jewish  refugee  advocate  and  an  Iraqi  Shi'ite  Muslim  is  so  strong  it  caught  the  eye  of  film  producers.   Hassan  Sabbagh,  with  the  help  of  Judy  Mdallen  applied  for  a  Metroscreen  and  Australian  Film  and  Television  Office  grant  to  make  a  short  film  -  and  they  won.   This  was  not  something  Sabbagh  could  have  imagined  doing  a  year  ago  when  he  met  his  only  visitor  during  the  four  years  and  three  months  he  spent   in  Australian  detention  centres.   The  five-minute  docu-drama,  Tea  for  Two,  tells  the  story  of  the  friendship  between  the  outgoing  Jewish  mother  and  the  middle-aged  Iraqi  who  had  fled  Saddam  Hussein's  regime  some  15  years  ago.   ""Our  friendship  is  based  on  mutual  admiration.  He  has  transformed  my  life.  I  see  the  world  through  his  eyes  and  he  makes  me  more  appreciative  of  my  world,""  said  Mdallen.   ""We  talk  about  religion,  history,  lit  erature,  life  in  general.  I  tried  to  take  him  away  from  his  suffering.""   With  her  help,  he  is  now  getting  his  life  back  together.  He  studies  at  night  and  works  as  a  bookkeeper.   But  the  most  important  thing  for  Sabbagh  is  reuniting  with  his  family,  and  it  is  often  Mdallen  who  has  kept  him  going  through  his  daily  life.   ""She  believes  everything  is  possible  which  fills  me  with  hope  that  there  is  a  future.  This  is  a  very  huge  gift.  Being  a  refugee  is  very  difficult;  everything  and  everyone  is  new,""  said  Sabbagh.   Actors  Lex  Marinos  and  Amanda  Bishop  play  Hassan  Sabbagh  and  Judy  Mclallen  in  a  scene   from  Tea  for  Two.   “She  has  also  shown  me  the  joy  of  eating  a  light  and  fluffy  matzah  ball,  not  high  on  the  list  of  traditional   Arab  foods.”  hassan  sabbagh   Former  Iraqi  refugee   ""She  has  taught  me  how  to  get  around  the  city,  how  to  do  the  most  seemingly-simple  tasks  that  are  foreign  to  me,  like  talking  to  an  automated  voice  on  the  phone  and  using  an  ATM  machine.

"  Muslim  party  ‘a  crank  attempt’   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   A  PROPOSAL  to  establish  a  national   Muslim  political  party  “appears  to  be  a  crank  attempt  by  a  failed  candidate  to  exploit  the  Muslim  community”,  a   Federal  MP  has  warned.   Michael  Danby,  deputy  chair  of  federal  parliament’s  joint  standing  committee  on  electoral  matters,  was  commenting  on  the  application  of  a  Vietnamese  Muslim  convert  in  Can  berra  to  register  Australia’s  first  Mus  lim  political  party.   The  party’s  founder,  Kurt  Kennedy,  an  unsuccessful  independent  candi  date  in  Canberra’s  ACT  Legislative   Assembly  elections  last  year,  believes   that  Australians  should  live  under  Islamic  law.   “If  they  read  through  the  Koran  there’s  nothing  there  that  will  threaten  them,”  he  said.

"  Muslim  contractor  crafts   outh  African  shul   AMIR  MIZROCH   CAPE  TOWN  -  While  Jewish  places  of  worship  were  being  destroyed,  looted  and  burned  by  Muslims  in  the  Gaza  Strip,  gentler  Muslim  hands  were  carefully  crafting  a  new  syna  gogue  in  the  picturesque  South   African  town  of  Somerset  West.   Waleed  Arnolds,  a  respected  Mus  lim  building  contractor  in  the  Helde  berg  area  of  the  Western  Cape  and  his   Muslim  construction  crew  toiled  for  three  months  to  get  the  new  Strand  Somerset  West  Hebrew  Congrega  tion  Synagogue  ready  in  time  for  Rosh  Hashanah,  so  that  his  Jewish  clients  would  have  a  place  of  worship  for  the  high  holy  days.   A  few  years  ago,  community  lead  ers  realised  they  would  eventually  have  to  move  out  of  their  city-center  shul,  situated  right  next  to  a  large  taxi  rank  and  shopping  mall,  as  the  area   became  busier.  Working  out  that  they  could  not  afford  to  build  a  new  shul,  the  Jewish  community  leaders  found  some  property  in  a  quieter  area  of  Somerset  West,  and  started  making  plans  to  convert  the  building  into  a   synagogue.   Last  week,  the  14  Jewish  families  and  their  guests  in  this  comer  of  the  Cape  of  Good  Hope  inaugurated  their  new  synagogue  at  a  ceremony  which  brought  pride,  and  not  a  few  tears  of  joy,  to  this  tiny  community.   Waleed  also  took  pride  in  this  par  ticular  project.  The  Muslim  commu  nity  in  this  part  of  the  Western  Cape  (Bo-Kaap)  numbers  in  the  hundreds  of  thousands,  and  relations  with  the  Jewish  community  have  traditionally  been  very  strong.  Waleed  himself  grew  up  with  some  of  the  people  for  whom  he  was  building  a  synagogue.   That  shared  history,  says  Cedric  Miller,  one  of  the  Strand-Somerset   West  Jewish  community  leaders,  is  the  secret  to  the  coexistence  between   Muslims  and  Jews  in  the  Heldeberg  area.  A  coexistence,  Miller  feels,  may  eventually  be  threatened  by  the  absence  of  a  shared  upbringing,  and  tight  community  relations,  as  increasingly,  Muslims  and  Jews  become  polarised  the  world  over.   Miller  grew  up  in  the  Strand  area,  “playing  with  them  [the  Muslims],  working  with  them,  eating  in  their  homes.  The  respect  to  one  another  has  been  shown  through  all  the  years.”   Despite  the  warm  relations,  Jewish  community  leaders  here  were  not  taking  any  chances,  and  decided,  after  consulting  the  Community  Security  Organisation,  not  to  place  a  Star  of  David,  or  any  Hebrew  writing,  on  the  outside  of  the  building  on   Lorensford  Road.   Going  back  100  years,  the  majori   ty  of  businesses  in  the  Strand-Somer  set  West  area  were  Jewish-owned,  a  testament  to  the  large  and  thriving  Jewish  presence  in  South  Africa  at  the  turn  of  the  century,  many  of  whom   came  from  Lithuania.   “When  it  came  to  Rosh  Hashanah  and  Yom  Kippur,  the  town  kind  of  died,  all  the  stores  were  closed,”  Miller  says,  retelling  the  story  from  personal  memory  and  family  tradi  tion.  “Even  during  the  dark  apartheid  years  when  the  colored  community  was  urged  to  boycott  white  business  es,  leaders  of  the  Muslim  community  never  stood  up  against  the  Jewish  owned  businesses,”  Miller  recalls.  “Their  attitude  was  that  when  they  were  in  need  for  things  during  their  religious  festivals,  there  were  Jewish  businesses  that  supported  them,”   adds  Miller.

"  MUSLIM  TURKISH  LEADER  AT  YAD  VASHEM   TURKISH  Prime  Minister  Recep  Tayyip  Erdogan  refused  to  conform  to  protocol  and  to  wear  a  kippah  while  visiting  Yad  Vashem  and  laying  a  wreath  on  the  Holo  caust  memorial.  Nonetheless,  the  Muslim  Erdogan  -  pictured  at  Yad  Vashem’s  Hall  of  Names  together  with  his  wife  Emine  and  Yad  Vashem  chairman  Avner  Shalev  -  broke  new  ground  by  visiting  Israel  to   cement  the  strong  military  and  trade  ties  between  the  two  east  Mediterranean  coun  tries.  The  two  countries  signed  a  deal  that  would  see  Israel  upgrading  30  Turkish  Phantom  jetfighters  for  around  $A650  mil  lion.  Trade  between  the  two  countries  reached  about  $A2.6  billion  in  2004,  of  which  $A400  million  are  spent  by  tens  of  thousands  of  Israeli  tourists  in  Turkey.   Endogan's  visit  comes  after  an  extend  ed  period  of  tension  between  Jerusalem  and  Ankara  in  the  wake  of  the  assassina  tion  of  several  Hamas  leadens.  Endogan  said  in  Israel  that  he  would  like  to  see  warmer  ties  and  to  have  his  country  serve  as  a  catalyst  for  improving  relations  between  Israel  and  its  Arab  neighbours.

"  Students  from  Noor  Al  Houda  Islamic  College  and  Moriah  College,  role-playing  to  breakdown  stereotypes.   Jewish,  Muslim  and  Catholic   students  find  common  around   SV1ARK  FRANKLIN   BRING  together  a  bunch  of  teenagers  from  an  Islamic,  a  Jewish  and  two  Catholic   schools,  and  what  do  you  get?  An  ordinary  bunch  of  teenagers,  socialising  wildly  like  any  group  of  adolescents  invariably  does.   But  the  25  students  from  Kincoppal  High  School,  Moriah  College,  Gilroy  College,  and  Noor  Al  Houda  Islamic  College  were  particu  larly  enthusiastic  when  they  met  this  week,  because  they  had  a  rare  opportunity.   It's  not  often  they  get  to  hang  out  with  other  kids  their  own  age,  who  think  in  similar  ways  to  themselves  and  face  similar  challenges  in  life,  yet  who  come  from  completely  different  backgrounds.   ""Never  in  my  whole  life  had  I  spoken  to  a  girl  with  a  headscarf  on,""  said  Natalie  Wicks,  a  Year  11  student  at  Moriah  College,  which  hosted  the  student  inter-faith  event.   After  giving  goodbye  hugs  to  three  Islamic  girls  who  she  spent  the  last  two  days  with  -  sharing  deeply-felt  opinions  and  exchanging  stories  from  their  different  lives  -  she  reflected,  ""For  me  it  just  broke  down  all  of  the  stereo  types.  I  didn't  think  they'd  be   so  cool.""   ""That's  the  point  of  this  program,""  said  Michelle  Brenner,  a  conflict-resolution  consultant  who  teamed  up  with  Forum  on  Australia's  Islamic  Relations  (FAIR)  direc  tor  Kuranda  Seyfi  Seyit  to  organise  the  event.   ""Just  through  meeting  each  other  and  through  talk  ing  they've  broken  down  a  lot  of  cultural  barriers.""   The  two-day  event  -  the  first  student  inter-faith  meet  ing  on  such  a  scale  in  NSW  -  was  funded  by  the  Department  of  Immigration,  Multiculturalism  and  Indigenous  Affairs  as  part  of  its  Living  in  Harmony  initia   tive.   It  was  designed  to  break  down  cultural  stereotypes  and  establish  more  intimate  connections  between  stu   dents  of  different  religions.  Utilising  role-play,  open  forums,  and  storytelling,  the  meeting  also  aimed  to  devel  op  the  students'  conflict  resolutions  skills.   ""Each  person  makes  assumptions  about  people  based  on  what  they  know  through  the  media  and  else  where,""  Seyit  said.  ""It's  not  until  you  start  looking  at  other  people's  individual  sto  ries  that  you  begin  to  under  stand  them  properly.""   While  moderating  the  final   session  on  Monday  after  noon,  which  addressed  media  narratives  about  reli  gion,  guest  presenter  Ben  Weiss  said:  ""Your  cultural  identity  gives  you  a  lens  through  which  you  see  the  world,  but  in  a  society  which  has  lots  of  cultures,  you   sometimes  need  a  different  lens.""   Year  9  Muslim  student  Mahmoud  Kamaledine  said:  ""Before  I  came  here  I  didn't  really  know  much  about  Jewish  people.  You  hear  a  lot  of  negative  stuff  about  Jews,  but  the  Jewish  people  I  have  met  here  seem  really  great.""   Year  11  Moriah  student   Carly  Fenton  said:  ""It's  really  important  when  we  go  back   to  our  different  areas  and   hear  people  talking  ignorant  ly  about  other  religions  or  other  cultures,  that  we  make  sure  to  correct  them  or  maybe  show  them  a  different  point  of  view.""   Seyit  said  he  hopes  the  event  will  lead  to  other  larger  initiatives:  ""We  need  to  start  building  a  movement,  not  just  leave  it  as  a  one-off  event.  And  the  best  people  in  society  to  do  this  are  the  youth  because  they  don't  have  any  of  the  baggage  that  so  many  other  people  in  society  have."" ",2005-09-23
"  Maccabiah  mix-up  sees   Iranian  Muslim  win  gold   AARON  KAPLOWI1Z   TEL  AVIV  -  You  don’t  have  to  be  Jewish  (or  even  an  Israeli  Arab)  to  win  at  the  Maccabiah.  Even  natives  of  countries  at  war  with  Israel  can   win  the  gold  -  almost.   Mohammad  Babulfath  went  undefeated  on  his  way  to  taking  first  place  in  the  84-kilogram  weight   class  of  the  Maccabiah’s  Greco  Roman  wrestling  competition  on  Sunday,  but  nobody  seems  to  know  how  he  got  into  the  competition  in  the  first  place.   The  Iranian-born  Muslim,  who  represents  Sweden  at  inter  national  competitions,  came  to  the   Maccabiah  with  his  team-mate   Jimmy  Samuellson  and  coach  Richard  Swierad,  neither  of  whom  are  Jewish.   The  three  had  no  idea  that  the  Maccabiah  was  only  open  to  Jews  and  Israelis,  and  came  to  participate  as  a  result  of  a  long  line  of  mix-ups.   “I  don’t  know  exacdy  how,”  said  Swierad,  laughing,  “but  we  are   here.”   Apparently,  the  Swedes  weren’t  the  only  ones  who  didn’t  know  exactly  how  they  ended  up  at  the  Maccabiah.  The  Israel  Wrestling  Federation  (IWF)  officials  and  the  Maccabiah  have  ducked  responsi  bility  for  the  Swedes’  presence,  but  slowly,  the  mess  on  the  mats  is  being  unravelled.   Last  month,  the  website  of  the  International  Federation  of  Associ   ated  Wrestling  carried  an  “invita  tion”  to  compete  at  the  Maccabiah  Games,  signed  by  IWF  president  Dr   Solomon  Stolar.   The  “invitation”  also  included  a   schedule  for  the  weigh-in  and  the  competitions.   However,  last  week  Dr  Stolar  denied  that  the  website  information  was  an  “open  invitation”.   IWF  treasurer  Beni  Megretishvili  only  found  out  “days  ago”  that  Bab  ulfath,  Samuellson  and  Swierad  were  coming  to  Israel.   “We  didn’t  want  a  situation   where  we  had  to  tell  a  country  that  it  can’t  participate.  So  we  let  them,”   he  said.   Dr  Stolar  said  that  the   Maccabiah  officials  invited  the  *  Swedish  men.   “The  Maccabiah,  according  to  its  criteria,  invited  participants.  I’m  not  qualified  to  decide  who  is  a  Jew   and  who  isn’t.  I  didn’t  check  them.  We  don’t  decide  who  to  accept  and  who  not  to.  We  only  organise  the  event,”  he  said.   Members  of  the  Maccabiah   sports  department,  however,  denied  that  they  had  anything  to  do  with   the  Swedish  men’s  involvement.   “They  were  invited  as  a  mistake  by  the  [wrestling]  committee,”  said  sports  department  director  Asaf   Stolarz.

"  Muslim  leader  refuses  to  discuss  facts  about  the  fax   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   QUEENSLAND  Islamic  leader  Hajji  Abdul  Rahman  Deen  refused  to  talk  when  reporters  in  Canberra  this  week  tried  to  question  him  about  a  fax  sug  gesting  a  Jewish  conspiracy  linked  to  the  September  11  terrorist  attacks.   Emerging  from  Prime  Minister  John  Howard’s  Islamic  summit  in  Parliament  House  on  Tuesday,  he  pushed  his  way  through  a  scrum  of  reporters,  photographers  and  televi  sion  cameramen  saying  he  had  noth   ing  to  add  to  an  earlier  statement  in  which  he  denied  holding  the  views   included  in  the  fax.   Widely-published  news  reports  on  Tuesday  said  that  the  fax  from  Deen’s  office  to  executive  members  of  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Council  (AFIC)  on  July  27  referred  to  a  western  connection  with  the  Sep  tember  11  New  York  terror  attack.   The  fax  said:  “September  11  is  def  initely  pursuant  to  the  West  and  yet  to  be  proven  in  any  court  of  law,  coro  ner’s  inquest  or  other.   “Where  are  the  black  boxes,  flight  recorders,  why  did  4000  Jews  not  show  up  for  work,  the  list  goes  on.  You  are  basically  condemning  every  Mus   lim”   AFIC  chief  executive  Amjad   Mehboob  said  he  was  concerned  that   Deen  had  said  similar  things  before.   But  Minister  Assisting  the  Prime  Minister  Gary  Hardgrave  defended  Deen,  a  Liberal  Party  member,  saying   he  had  been  the  victim  of  internal   AFIC  politics  and  “the  victim  of  a  hor  rible  misunderstanding”.   Deen  has  been  described  as  an  Islamic  moderate.  He  was  one  of  13   hand-picked  Muslim  leaders  who   attended  the  summit  at  which  most   agreed  afterwards  there  was  unanimi  ty  and  goodwill  all  round.   At  a  post-summit  press  conference,  Howard  described  the  participants  as  “a  representative”  group,  saying  he  made  no  apology  for  not  inviting  “people  with  extreme  views”.   “They  would  have  dominated  dis  cussion,”  he  said.   The  meeting  produced  a  statement   of  principles  committing  all  Aus  tralians  to  reject  all  forms  of  violence  or  terrorism  and  acts  or  language  pro  moting  hatred,  violence  or  terrorism.   It  emphasised  the  responsibility  of  Muslims,  particularly  their  leaders,  to  challenge  and  counteract  those  seek  ing  to  encourage  violence  and  terror   ism  in  the  name  of  Islam.   It  said  the  Federal  Government   would  seek  state  and  territory  cooper  ation  to  develop  a  national  strategy  to  address  intolerance  and  the  promo   tion  of  violence.

"  One  former  Muslim,  one  Buddhist,  two  Jews  and  a  newborn  Australian   MARK  FRANKLIN   HIS  father  is  an  Iranian  Muslim  who  converted  to  Christianity;  his  mother  is  a  Burmese  Buddhist  who  fled  to  Thailand;  his  adopted  grandmother  is  a  Hungarian-born  Jew;  and  his  god  father  is  the  senior  rabbi  at  Temple   Emanuel  Woollahra.   So  for  three-month-old  Alexander  Poorvadi,  whose  parents  are  recover  ing  from  the  trauma  of  several  years  inside  Villawood  Detention  Centre,  the  light  of  religion  is  likely  to  be  somewhat  kaleidoscopic.   Rabbi  Jeffrey  Kamins,  who  hosted  a  naming  ceremony  and  Kiddush  last  Friday  night  at  the  Woollahra  temple,  says  the  baby’s  parentage  is  a  lesson  in  tolerance  and  harmony.   “It  shows  that  we  can  have  differ  ent  families,  different  communities,  different  practices,  and  yet  we  are  all  part  of  humanity,  connected  to  the   same  source  of  life.”   Alexander’s  parents  Morteza  and  Jojo  met  in  Villawood  and  married  last  year.   Morteza  converted  from  Islam  to   Christianity  after  fleeing  Iran  with  his  family  in  2000.  His  parents  and  sib  lings  have  since  been  deported.   His  wife  Jojo  is  a  devout  Buddhist   who  fled  Burma  to  Thailand  before  immigrating  to  Australia  in  2002.   Both  have  been  released  from  immigration  detention  on  temporary  protection  visas,  but  their  status  as   Australian  residents  remains  uncer  tain.   Temple  Emanuel’s  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Kamins  (right),  pictured  at  the  naming  ceremony  at  shut  last  week  with  (from  left)  Anne-Marie  Kingston,  Morteza  Poorvadi  and  his  wife  Jojo  holding  baby  Alexander.   Rabbi  Kamins  befriended  Morteza   during  regular  visits  to  Villawood  over  the  past  three  years.  “The  Jewish  people,  who  themselves  have  suffered  so  terribly  from  a  lack  of  this  type  of  loving-kindness,  should  be  the  first,  I  feel,  to  visit  people  in  detention  cen   ters”   Meanwhile,  another  member  of  the  Jewish  community,  Anne  Marie  Kingston,  befriended  Jojo  during  her   own  visits  to  Villawood.  After  a  10  month  stint  in  detention,  Jojo  went  to  live  in  Kingston’s  home,  while   Morteza  remained  behind  the  razor   wire  where  the  couple  had  met.  But  separation  didn’t  end  their  courtship.   “She  could  hardly  speak  any  Eng  lish,”  Kingston  said.  “I  couldn’t  understand  it,  but  obviously  love  is   more  easily  understood  because  they  would  spend  hours  talking  on  the  phone.  She  loves  him  dearly  and  they’re  thrilled  with  Alexander.”   Jojo  affectionately  calls  Kingston  “mum”,  and  now  her  adopted  mother  is  a  very  proud  grandmother.  She  believes  Alexander’s  mixed  back   ground  will  be  a  blessing  rather  than   an  obstacle.   “I  think  Alexander  is  going  to  grow  up  with  a  lot  of  love  and  he’s  going  to  go  to  a  school  where  he’ll   meet  15  other  children  from  mixed  backgrounds.   His  parents  will  encourage  him  to  make  up  his  own  mind  about  reli  gion,  and  I’m  sure  it  will  be  very  enriching  for  him.” ",2005-06-03
"  Putting  our  own  house  in  order   KALEIDOSCOPE   JULIE  SZEGO   The  justified  need  to  examine  the  curricula  of  Muslim  schools  will  necessitate  some  introspection  at  Jewish  schools  as  well.   Y  Muslim  friend  is  pretty  anxious  these  days.  She  feels  like  a  specimen  under  a  microscope:   Isn’t  naming  sporting   houses  after  West  Bank  settlements,  as  one   Melbourne  school  has   been  known  to  do,  just  a  little  too  provocative?   picked-apart,  analysed,  labelled.  The  politics  of  the  hijab,  arranged  mar  riages,  the  preaching  of  imams,  the  street-talk  of  ethnic  gangs  in  the  sub  urbs,  the  contents  of  books  in  Islamic  shops  -  all  these  used  to  be  considered  either  private  matters  of  faith  or  cul  tural  norms  tolerated  in  the  interests  of   “diversity”.  Those  days  are  long  gone  and  they  won’t  be  back  any  time  soon.  I  feel  for  my  friend,  and  share  her  unease,  even  as  I  firmly  believe  that  this  new,  tougher  approach  is  absolutely  necessary.   The  world  certainly  changed  on  September  11,  2001  but  it  took  the  philosophical  aftershocks  of  the  Lon  don  bombings  -  the  angst  unleashed  by  the  sight  of  home-grown,  cricket  loving  lads  turning  against  the  country  that  reared  them  -  to  shake  things  up  closer  to  home.  The  reality  is  that  the  live-and-let-live  multicultural  pact  that  has  existed  in  this  country  since  the  early  1970s  is  now  coming  up  for  renewal.  And  anyone  who  thinks  the  Jewish  community  can  remain  immune  from  the  consequences  of  this  profound  shift  is,  frankly,  kidding   themselves.   Consider  the  controversy  over  Islamic  schools.  Talk  to  prominent  Muslims  about  how  they  feel  about  the  state  opening  their  schools  to  greater  scrutiny  (a  subject  discussed  at  the  prime  minister’s  recent  summit  with  Muslim  leaders)  and  they  tend  to  respond:  “Sure,  but  why  just  Muslim  schools?  How  about  other  religious  schools  -  such  as  Jewish  schools  for  instance?”   On  the  one  hand  this  is  a  cheeky  attempt  on  their  part  to  deflect  some  of  the  heat.  After  all,  it’s  not  Jews  blow  ing  themselves  up  on  trains  in  western  capitals.  But  as  a  matter  of  law  and  principle,  any  attempt  to  make  Mus  lim  schools  more  accountable  would  need  to  apply  equally  across  the  reli  gious-education  sector,  which,  after  all,  enjoys  increasingly-high  levels  of  gov  ernment  funding.   I  know  the  more-secular  Jewish  schools  which  foster  ties  with  their   Muslim  counterparts  are  beyond  reproach  when  it  comes  to  promoting  tolerance.  I  don’t  know  precisely  what  is  taught  at  the  more-religious  schools,  but  if  it’s  anything  like  it  was  in  my  childhood,  there  is  little  to  fear.  I  came  away  from  an  Orthodox  school  valu  ing  the  sanctity  of  life,  intellectual  inquiry  and  the  idea  of  justice.  Of  course,  I  can’t  remember  too  much  being  said  about  Simpson  and  his  donkey,  the  iconic  figures  from  the  battlefields  of  Gallipoli  who,  according   to  Education  Minister  Brendan  Nel   son,  should  be  held  up  to  all  students   as  the  embodiment  of  “Australian  val  ues”.   And  yet,  certain  things  would  not  have  been  too  flattering  had  they  come  to  the  general  community’s  attention.  All  schools  need  to  dispassionately  assess  how  they  tackle  the  Arab-Israeli  conflict.  I  remember  playing  a  game  of  night  manoeuvres  at  a  school  camp   once  in  which  the  two  teams  were  named  “Israelis”  and  “Arabs”.  This   might  seem  harmless,  but  in  today’s  edgy  climate  I  think  outsiders  would  consider  it  inflammatory.  And  isn’t  naming  sporting  houses  after  West  Bank  settlements,  as  one  Melbourne  school  has  been  known  to  do,  just  a  lit  tle  too  provocative?  I  think  so.   (A  slight  digression:  the  feminist  undercurrent  to  the  debate  about  the  hijab  prompted  a  recollection  from  my  primary  school  days.  The  girls  in  our  year  were  rehearsing  our  bat-mitz  vah  ceremonies  in  costumes  that  com  prised  skimpy  leotards.  Some  male  rabbis  in  the  school  later  demanded  the  costumes  be  changed  on  the  grounds  they  were  “immodest”.  It  was  years  before  I  considered  the  unsavoury  implications  of  middle  aged  men  seeing  our  clumsy,  border  line-pubescent  bodies  as  “dangerous”  enough  to  cover  up.  So  it  isn’t  only  Muslim  men  who  prefer  to  control   their  women  rather  than  their  own  desires.)   All  this  is  a  confronting  prospect  in  one  sense,  but  looked  at  another  way  it’s  also  an  opportunity  to  get  some  moral  clarity.  The  community  would   be  wise  to  initiate  a  “values  audit”  of  our  own.  In  calling  for  a  crackdown  on   antisemitic  incitement  in  Islamic   schools,  it’s  surely  absolutely  essential  that  our  house  be  in  perfect  order.  And  given  the  recent  schism  over  the  disen  gagement  from  Gaza,  we  probably   could  use  some  reassurance  that  a  con  sensus  about  “values”  does  exist.  I   would  include  as  ground  rules  the  fol  lowing:  tolerance,  equality  of  the  sexes,  the  supremacy  of  liberal,  secular  democracy  and  respect  for  the  rule  of  law  -  and  I  don’t  mean  just  here.   Let’s  nail  this  on  our  own  before   others  get  the  opportunity  to  do  it  for   us.   Julie  Szego  is  a  journalist  at  the  Age.   Her  column  appears  monthly. ",2005-09-09

On  the  contrary,  history  has  shown  us   that  Jews  and  Muslims  lived  in  peace,  harmony  and  friendship  for  many  years  in  the  past.  This  should  be  the  aim  for  the  future.   ALMOST  20  years  have  passed   since  the  day  the  world  started  to  change,  following  the  end  of  the  Cold  War.  Enemies  of  yester   aay  nave  become  mends,  me  threats   of  the  past  have  transformed  into  agreements  of  economic,  cultural  and  scientific  cooperation.   This  process  has  not  excluded  the  Middle  East.  Israel’s  relations  with   Arab  and  Muslim  states  are  growing.  Relations  with  major  Muslim  states  such  as  Turkey  are  flourishing.  And  these,  in  addition  to  the  full  diplo  matic  and  peaceful  relations  that  Israel  has  with  Egypt  and  Jordan.   A  few  days  ago,  Israel  completed  the  evacuation  of  all  Israeli  settle  ments  in  the  Gaza  Strip.  The  deci   sion  of  the  Israeli  Government  to  evacuate  Israeli  citizens  from  that   region  was  anything  but  an  easy  one.   Thousands  of  families  were  forced  to  leave  their  homes.  Children  had  to   leave  their  kindergartens  and  schools,  and  many  people  lost  their  means  of  livelihood.  Despite  all  these  difficulties,  Israel  has  implemented  its  disengagement  plan  in  order  to  break  the  political  stalemate  in  the  region  and  to  restart  the  peace  process.  This  historic  decision  reflects  Israel’s  yearning  for  peace  with  all  its  Arab  neighbours.   Today  there  are  no  more  Israelis  in  Gaza.  Israeli  military  rule  in  that  area  has  ended.  Responsibility  for  the   affairs  .of  Gaza  and  its  residents  is  in  Palestinian  hands.  The  Palestinians  now  have  the  chance  to  take  their  fate  into  their  own  hands.  Gaza,  we  hope,  will  serve  as  a  model  of  how   the  Palestinian  Authority  (PA)  is  able  to  build  a  functioning,  democratic  and  peaceful  society.   This  requires  ending  the  anarchy   and  violence  which  have  charac   terised  Palestinian  governance  in  the  past,  and  establishing  the  effective  rule  of  law.  The  PA  must  act  as  demanded  by  the  international  com  munity-  to  dismantle  the  armed  ter  rorist  organisations  which  continue  to  use  their  violence  as  a  political  weapon  against  Israel’s  civilians  and  against  the  Palestinians  themselves.   The  PA,  with  the  help  of  the  inter  national  community,  must  ensure  that  there  is  only  one  source  of  authority  for  the  use  of  force  in  Palestinian  society,  and,  together  with  the  international  community,   must  work  to  rehabilitate  the  Pales   tinian  economy  and  provide  eco  nomic  opportunities  to  their  people.   Israel  stands  ready  to  assist  where  possible  in  these  processes.  Israel  has  expressed  its  strong  support  for   international  aid  and  assistance  for   the  social  and  economic  develop  ment  of  Gaza,  and  we  are  committed  to  facilitating  these  efforts.  We  seek   to  ensure  conditions  that  will  benefit   ordinary  Palestinians,  without  pos  ing  a  security  threat  to  Israel.   Israel’s  drive  for  peace  and  good   relations  does  not  end  with  its   immediate  neighbours.  We  seek  good  relations  with  all  nations.  At  this  time  of  renewed  hope  for  progress  towards  peace  in  the  Middle  East,  we  believe  that  the  time  is  ripe  to  promote  dialogue  with  all   countries.   This  is  particularly  true  regarding   the  Muslim  world.  Israel  does  not  see  Islam  as  an  enemy  and  has  never  seen  it  as  such.  On  the  contrary,  his  tory  has  shown  us  that  Jews  and  Muslims  lived  in  peace,  harmony  and  friendship  for  many  years  in  the  past.  This  should  be  the  aim  for  the   future.   I  have  just  returned  from  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  in  New  York,  where  I  met  with  many  of  my  Arab  and  Muslim  counterparts  to  discuss  bilateral  ties  and  regional  cooperation  for  the  benefit  of  all  our   citizens.   We  all  agreed  that  there  is  much  to  be  gained  for  all  by  increasing  our  efforts  to  promote  understanding  and  cooperation  between  us.   The  ability  to  speak,  to  exchange   views,  and  to  listen  to  each  other   does  not  of  course  require  that  we  all  automatically  agree.  On  the  con  trary,  open  dialogue  enables  a  possi  bility  of  exchanging  views,  consulting,  and  resolving  differences  if  and  when  they  arise,  all  within  the  context  of  mutual  respect,  sincerity,  honesty,  openness  and  transparency.   Nor  should  the  Palestinian  issue  serve  as  an  obstacle  to  such  contact.   Indeed,  at  a  time  when  Israel  enjoys  peaceful  relations  with  Egypt  and  Jordan,  and  open  contacts  with  the   Palestinians  and  many  others  of  our  Arab  and  Muslim  neighbours,  there   is  no  reason  for  other  Islamic  coun   tries  to  persist  with  the  boycotts  of  the  past.   One  of  the  central  challenges  we  face  in  building  such  dialogue  is  the  fact  that  in  certain  parts  of  the  world,  information  and  knowledge  about  Israel  has  been  deliberately  biased  and  one-sided  for  many  decades.  This  “knowledge”  is  often  designed   to  foster  hatred  and  to  incite  violence   and  hostility  against  us.   The  true  picture  of  Israel  is  less  well  known.  Many  people  are  unaware,  for  example,  that  the  mod  em  state  of  Israel  is  an  open,  demo  cratic  and  pluralistic  society  in  which  multiculturalism  is  an  inherent  part  of  daily  life.   There  is  also  a  broad  lack  of  knowledge  about  Israel’s  far-reach  ing  achievements  in  the  fields  of  high-tech,  medicine  and  scientific  research,  and  the  fact  that  Israel  shares  its  know-how  with  many   countries  around  the  world.   We  are  happy  to  do  the  same  with   Indonesia.   For  such  mutually-beneficial  cooperation  to  develop,  we  need  to  be  able  to  talk  to  each  other.  We  need  to  understand  each  other  better,  and  to  remove  the  barriers  of  the  past,  so  that  we  may  build  cooperation  and  friendship  for  the  future.  Now  is  the  time  to  begin  this  dialogue.   Silvan  Shalom  is  Israel’s  deputy  prime  minister  and  minister  of  foreign  affairs.   I ",2005-10-07
"  LA  CONSULATE  TARGETED?   LOS  ANGELES  -  FBI  counterterrorism  agents  are  investigating  whether  two  American  Muslim  converts  planned  to  attack  the  Israeli  consulate,  two  syna  gogues  and  other  targets  in  Los  Angeles.

"  ANTISEMITIC  RELATIVITY   IN  singling  out  Britain,  France  and  Canada  as  countries  where  large  Muslim  populations  have  not  destroyed  the  “relatively  peaceful”  relations  between  Jews  and  others,  could  Mark  Pritchard  (AJN  11/3)  please  explain  relative  to  what?   In  the  first  five  years  of  this  century  over  100  synagogues  were  vandalised  or  firebombed  in  the  UK  alone.  In  fact  the  2003/4  Antisemitism  Worldwide  Report  from  the  Stephen  Rothman  Institute  at  Tel  Aviv  University  explic  itly  states,  “The  five  countries  with  the  highest  levels  of  antisemitic  incidents  were  France,  the  United  Kingdom,  Russia,  Germany  and  Canada”  and  the   violence  was  “perpetrated  mainly  by  Muslim  immigrants  in  Europe”  (www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/  asw2003-4/general-analysis.htm).   Dr  Daniel  Pipes  has  good  reason  for  warning  of  renewed  anti  semitism.  The  problem  has  grown  so  bad  in  the  last  few  years  that  even  the  EU,  the  OSCE  nations  and  the  UN  have  held  conferences  or  seminars  on  combating  it.

The  Youth  Encounters  Forum,  an  initiative  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  along  with  Affinity  Intercultural  Foundation,  brings  students  of  different  religions  together  to  promote  harmony.  In  its  second  year,  the  conference  has  dou  bled  in  size,  uniting  120  students  from  six  faith-based  high  schools  in  NSW,  compared  to  60  students  from  three  schools  at  last  year’s  confer   ence.   “Today  was  a  great  success,  espe  cially  in  the  political  climate  of  today.  It  is  inspiring  to  see  120  high  school  students  coming  together  and  talking  about  religion  in  Aus  tralia,”  project  pioneer  and  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  Commu  nity,  Youth  and  Education  officer  Josh  Levin  said.   Terrorism,  Jews  for  Jesus  and  reli   gious  stereotyping  were  among  the  topics  addressed  during  workshops  held  throughout  the  day.  There  was   also  a  focus  on  conflict  resolution.   Students  were  divided  into  groups  with  members  of  each  faith  and  a  group  facilitator.  Each  group  was  encouraged  to  discuss  the  pre  conceptions  they  had  about  other  religious  groups.  The  sessions  aimed  to  break  down  stereotypes  held  through  discussion  and  debate.   “At  the  end  of  the  day,  we  under  stood  each  other’s  religions  a  bit  bet  ter;  I  don’t  blame  them  anymore  for  what  is  happening  in  the  Middle  East,”  Khaled  Jaben,  a  Muslim  stu  dent,  told  the  AJN.   Students  spent  the  six  weeks  pre  ceding  the  forum  studying  religious  groups,  as  well  as  their  own.  The  day  afforded  an  opportunity  to  test  and  expand  that  knowledge.   “The  most  incredible  part  of  the  day  was  that  we  could  actually  meet  people  of  other  religions.  We  never  would  have  met  these  people  if  it   hadn’t  been  for  this  program,”   Emanuel  School  student  Daniella  Cohen  said.   “It  allowed  us  to  fight  against  the  stereotypes  and  realise  that  they  are  not  all  terrorists,”  added  Victoria  Fridman.   NSW  Premier  Morris  lemma   addressed  the  students  at  the  closing  ceremony  and  commended  the  ini   tiative.   “In  these  times,  we  must  do  everything  possible  to  nurture  and  promote  greater  understanding  between  cultural  groups.  It  is  an  essential  building  block  in  a  truly  tolerant  society.  This  is  a  clear  sign  that  our  youth  is  committed  to  tak  ing  a  leadership  role  in  promoting  interfaith  harmony,”  lemma  said.

"  ASIO  liaising  with  Jews  over  terrorist  threat   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   THE  Australian  Security  Intelligence  Organisation  (ASIO)  is  closely  liaising  with  Jewish  and  Muslim  community  leaders  as  it  warns  pub  licly  for  the  first  time  of  a  terrorist  threat  from  Australian-born  extremists.   In  its  annual  report,  released  as  federal  parliament  prepares  to  debate   what  critics  describe  as  “draconian”  anti-terrorist  laws,  ASIO  says  it  is  working  closely  with  police  services   “in  relation  to  threats  to  Israeli  and   Jewish  interests  and  maintains  regu  lar  contact  with  representatives  of  the  Jewish  community”.   Meanwhile,  in  an  urgently  called  press  conference  on  Wednesday,  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  warned  of  an  “imminent”  terrorist  threat  and  said  he  would  be  intro   ducing  special  urgent  legislation  sep   arate  from  the  controversial  counter-terrorism  measures  still  under  consideration.   ASIO  is  also  maintaining  regular  contact  with  Muslim  community  leaders  and  working  closely  with  police  services  “in  connection  with  threats  to  the  Muslim  community”.   But  it  warns  that  a  sense  of  isolation   and  rejection  among  extremists   makes  it  difficult  for  moderate  ele  ments  in  the  Australian  Muslim   community  to  counteract  extremists.   “Extremists  perceive  Islamic  moderates  to  be  part  of  the  prob  lem,”  the  report  says.   Tabling  the  report  in  federal  par  liament,  Attorney-General  Philip   Ruddock  said:  “It  is  clear  the  threat  or  terrorism  is  ongoing  and  Aus   tralians  are  not  immune.”   The  ASIO  report  is  a  public  ver   sion  of  a  classified  secret  document  and  omits  much  detail  about  the  intelligence  agency’s  operations,  but  gives  considerable  emphasis  to  what  the  agency  perceives  as  terrorist  threats  from  overseas  and  from  extremists  in  Australia  who  “come   from  a  variety  of  ethnic  back  grounds”.

A  great  recent  read:  First  Mothers  by  Bonnie  Angelo.  It  is  a  book  most  Jew  ish  mothers  would  appreciate  and  is  about  the  lives  of  the  mothers  of  the  presidents  of  the  United  States  from  Roosevelt  to  Bush  and  the  way  they  shaped  their  son's  lives.   A  favourite  from  childhood:  It  has  to  be  Shel  Silverstein’s  Where  the  Side  walk  Ends,  a  book  of  quirky  poetry  which  I  still  read  to  my  children;  as  well  as  Cunous  George  Goes  to  Hos  pital  and  Madeline.   A  book  that  changed  me:  The  House  on  Garibaldi  Street,  written  by  Isser  Harel.  It  is  the  story  of  the  capture  of   Nazi  leader  Adolf  Eichmann.  I  read  it  years  ago  in  high  school  and  it  made  me  realise  how  such  a  tiny  new  state  as  Israel  could  have  such  powerful  convictions  to  do  the  impossible.  I  think  it  helped  shape  my  love  for  Israel  as  a  homeland  and  haven  for  the  Jewish  people  and  made  me  more  conscious  to  contribute  and  fulfil  my  part  as  a  Jew.   My  favourite  Bible  story:  At  the  moment,  I  am  going  to  a  evening  classes  where  we  are  studying  the  women  of  the  Torah  including  Miriam  who  was  an  inspirational  leader.  I  think  my  son’s  bar  mitzvah  parsha,  the  story  of  Noah  and  the  ark,  defi  nitely  makes  me  feel  in  awe  of  our   creator.

"  THE  REAL  WORLD   DAVID  Bornstein  (AJN  27/5)  expressed  outrage  that  his  sensibilities  as  a  Jew  are  not  catered  for  by  the  Muslim  community.   He  is  doomed  to  disappointment.  Not  only  that  community,  but  a  large  part  of  the  world  in  general  will  con  tinue  to  ignore  our  sensibilities.  We  are  numerically  small.  We  do  not  command  the  titanic  economic  and   hence  diplomatic  and  propaganda  power  that  is  wielded  by  the  nation  of   Islam  and  its  western  collaborators.   Also,  let  us  remember  that  certain  theological  stigmas  that  were  attached  to  us  by  Christians  and  Mus  lims  are  still  deeply  entrenched  in  western  and  Islamic  culture.  Then  there  is  the  element  of  envy  of  Jews’  success.  It  is  clear,  too,  that  many  on  the  political  left  are  still  faithful  to  that  camp’s  traditional  virulent  anti-Jew   ishness.   Paradoxically,  however,  but  most  importantly  of  all,  is  the  very  issue  that  Dr  Bornstein  implicitly  suggests  makes  us  worthy  of  respect  -  namely   the  “norms  and  morals”  which  the   Jewish  people  introduced  into  the  world:  for  this,  many  in  the  world  have  never  forgiven  us.

"  NO  SCHOOL  BAN  ON  RELIGIOUS  SYMBOLS   A  SPOKESPERSON  for  Victorian  Education  Minister  Lynne  Kosky  said  the  State  Govern   ment  has  no  plans  to  outlaw  hijabs  (Muslim  headscarves)  or  other  forms  of  religious  expression  from  state  schools.   The  assurance  came  after  Victorian   independent  MP  Russell  Savage  said  hijabs,  crucifixes  and  yarmulkes  should  be  banned  from  public  schools.   His  call  followed  comments  from  feder   al  Liberals  Bronwyn  Bishop  and  Sophie  Panopoulos  criticising  the  wearing  of  the  hijab  in  government  schools,  which  were  rejected  by  Prime  Minister  John  Howard.   Panopoulos,  however,  has  stepped  up  her  campaign  against  headscarves,  saying  the  Islamic  hijab  curtails  women’s  rights. ",2005-09-09
"  Backlash  over  Pesach  seder  concessions  for  Muslims   ANGIE  FOX   CHANGES  made  to  the  format  of  an  inter-faith  model  seder  in  Melbourne  last  week  to  accommodate  Muslim   guests  have  sparked  a  Jewish  commu  nity  backlash.   The  changes  included  the  serving  of  grape  juice  instead  of  wine,  which  is  banned  under  Muslim  law,  and  the  omission  of  the  spiritual  yearning  “L’shana  haba’ah  b’Yerushalayim”,  which  Jews  have  been  saying  at  the  end   of  the  seder  service  for  centuries.   Around  80  people  attended  the  seder  in  Prahran  on  April  10,  which  was  led  by  Temple  Beth  Israel’s  senior  rabbi,  Fred  Morgan,  as  part  of  Build  ing  Bridges,  a  joint  B’nai  B’rith  Anti  Defamation  Commission-Australian  Intercultural  Society  project   After  reports  of  the  omission  first  appeared,  the  AJN  received  a  number   of  letters  from  members  of  the  com  munity  condemning  the  organising  committee’s  decision  to  edit  the  phrase  out  of  the  abridged  haggadah  used  at   the  function.   In  a  sermon  delivered  at  Caulfield  Hebrew  Congregation  last  Shabbat  afternoon,  Rabbinical  Council  of  Vic  toria  (RCV)  acting  president  Rabbi  Meir  Shlomo  Kluwgant  said:  “In  the  event  that  someone  believes  that  omit   ting  and  hiding  the  truth  will  bring  even  the  smallest  measure  of  peace,  then  this  person  is  sadly  mistaken.   “The  truth  is  that  the  prayer,  the  hope  that  is  entrenched  in  the  deepest  recesses  of  the  soul  of  every  Jew,  is  that  next  year  we  celebrate,  all  together,  in  Jerusalem.”   Rabbi  Mordechai  Gutnick,  presi  dent  of  the  Organisation  of  Rabbis  of  Australasia,  described  the  invocation  as  “a  vital  expression  of  our  historic   A  Muslim  participant  reads  the  Pesach  hagaddah  at  an  Inter-faith  seder   service.  Photo:  Joseph  Feil   Jewish  feelings,  faith  and  hope”   “Any  bridges  that  are  built  between  different  communities  need  to  be  built  on  firm  foundations,  and  in  this  case  this  means  that  there  must  be  honesty  and  forthrightness.”   While  much  of  the  criticism  has  been  levelled  at  Rabbi  Morgan,  Build  ing  Bridges  co-chair  Walter  Rapoport  said  the  rabbi  was  not  responsible  for   the  omission.   He  said  a  five-person  subcommit  tee,  which  did  not  include  Rabbi  Mor  gan,  made  the  decision  prior  to  consultation  with  their  Muslim  coun  terparts.   “The  policy  was  in  keeping  with  the  tenor  of  the  entire  project  and  that  is  to  ensure  that  political  aspects  of  Jewish  Muslim  relations  are  forbidden  in  public  forums,”  he  said.   Building  Bridges,  which  launched  last  year,  brings  10  Muslim  and  10  Jew  ish  families  together  for  various  social  and  educational  activities  throughout  the  year  to  foster  increased  tolerance   between  the  two  communities.

"  RELIGIOUS  LEADERS  SPLIT  OVER  TSUNAMI   ORYANA  KAUFMAN   IN  the  aftermath  of  one  of  the  world’s  worst  natural  disasters,  Jewish,  Christ-  ian  and  Muslim  religious  leaders  are   divided  about  whether  or  not  the   tsunami  was  God’s  punishment.   Either  way,  the  tsunami  was  indis-  criminate.  It  wiped  out  Buddhist,  Hindu,  and  Muslim  villages  in  Sri  Lanka  and  India,  inflicted  enormous  casualties  in  mostly  Islamic  Indonesia,  and  devastated  parts  of  predominant-  ly  Buddhist  Thailand,  where  Christian  and  Jewish  holidaymakers  also  per-   ished.   Sydney’s  Temple  Emanuel  Wool-  lahra  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Kamins  was  one  of  the  Jewish  leaders  “horrified”  by  Anglican  Dean  of  Sydney  Phillip  Jensen’s  searing  comments  last  week  that  the  tsunami  was  a  “warning  that  judgement  is  coming”.   “God  forbid  that  this  was  an  act  of   God.  I’m  horrified  when  I  hear  people  talk  of  this  being  Gods  will  in  a  form  of  judgement  and  punishment.  I  find  that  an  extraordinary  statement  of  human  arrogance  to  say  such  things,”  Rabbi  Kamins  told  the  AJN.   “All  our  scientific  understanding  of   the  universe  teaches  us  that  nature  is   amoral  and  that  life  is  dangerous  and  unfair,”  he  added.   But  Rabbinical  Council  of  Victoria   acting  president  Rabbi  Meir  Shlomo  Kluwgant  said  he  doesn’t  believe  the  tsunami  was  a  freak  act  of  nature;  rather  that  “it  has  a  purpose”.   “God  is  in  control.  There  is  provi-  dence  in  everything  that  occurs.  To  suggest  we  understand  why  God  does  these  things  is  beyond  our  realm,”  Rabbi  Kluwgant  said.   Rabbinical  Council  of  NSW  presi-  dent  Rabbi  Yoram  Ulman  agreed:   “Nothing  in  this  world  happens  as  a  freak  accident;  everything  comes  from   God.”   One  of  Israel’s  chief  rabbis,  howev-  er,  described  the  tsunami  as  divine  ret-  ribution.  “This  is  an  expression  of  God’s  ire  with  the  world,”  Sephardi   chief  Rabbi  Shlomo  Amar  told  Reuters  last  week.   “The  world  is  being  punished  for  wrongdoings  -  be  it  people’s  needless  hatred  of  each  other,  lack  of  charity  and  moral  turpitude.”   But  the  emeritus  rabbi  at  Mel-   bourne’s  Temple  Beth  Israel,  Rabbi  John  Levi,  said  he  was  “embarrassed”  by  such  remarks,  which  he  said  “turn   God  into  the  devil  or  Satan”.   The  chief  executive  of  the  Aus-  tralian  Federation  of  Islamic  Coun-   cils,  Amjad  Mehboob,  also  described  the  tragedy  as  a  warning   from  God. ",2005-01-07
"  Israel  offers  historic  olive  branch  to  Indonesia   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   IN  a  history-making  bid  for  closer  diplomatic  ties  with  Indonesia  and  the  Muslim  world,  Israel’s  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Foreign  Minister  Silvan  Shalom  had  an  article  pub  lished  on  Monday  in  the  Jakarta  Post.   It  was  the  first  time  that  an  article  written  by  an  Israeli  minister  has  appeared  in  the  press  in  Indonesia,  home  to  the  world’s  largest  Muslim  population.   “Israel  does  not  see  Islam  as  an  enemy,”  he  wrote  in  Indonesia’s  most  influential,  English-language  daily.  “We  need  to  be  able  to  talk  to  each  other.   “History  has  shown  us  that  Jews  and  Muslims  lived  in  peace,  harmony  and  friendship  for  many  years  in  the  past.  This  should  be  the  aim  for  the  future,”  Shalom  wrote.   Israel’s  ambassador  to  Singapore,  Ilan  Ben-Dov,  who  helped  arrange  for  the  article  to  appear,  reported  to  the  Israeli  Foreign  Ministry:  “I  believe  we  can  say  that  history  was  made  on  Monday,  with  the  publication  of  the  foreign  minister’s  opinion  piece  in  this  important  newspaper.”   Diplomatic  sources  saw  the  article  as  building  on  what  the  New  York  Jewish  weekly,  the  Forward,  described  as  “a  whirlwind  week  of  diplomatic  breakthroughs”  for  Israel  at  last   month’s  United  Nations  world  lead  ers  summit  where  Islamic  nations   displayed  a  more-friendly  attitude  following  Israel’s  withdrawal  from   Gaza.

Photo:  AP/AAP   applauded,  and  foreign  ministers  of  a  dozen  Arab  and  Muslim  nations,  led  by  Indonesia,  lined  up  to  meet  Sharon  and  Shalom.  They  included  representatives  of  several  states  that  had  not  agreed  previously  to  open   contact  with  Israelis.   Most  significant  was  Sharon’s  meeting  with  Pakistan’s  President  Pervez  Musharraf.  Musharraf  said  Pakistan  had  decided  to  initiate  offK  cial  contact  with  Israel  “in  response  to  the  bold  step  taken  by  Prime  Minister   Sharon  to  withdraw  from  Gaza”.   Shalom  held  separate  discussions  with  counterparts  from  Islamic  nations,  including  Indonesia’s  For  eign  Minister  Hassan  Wirayuda.   In  his  article,  Shalom  wrote:  “Israel’s  drive  for  peace  and  good   relations  does  not  end  with  its  imme   diate  neighbours.  We  seek  good  rela   tions  with  all  nations.   “At  this  time  of  renewed  hope  for  progress  towards  peace  in  the  Middle  East,  we  believe  that  the  time  is  ripe  to  promote  dialogue  with  all  countries.   “This  is  particularly  true  regarding   the  Muslim  world.

Islam  as  an  enemy  and  has  never  seen  it  as  such.  At  a  time  when  Israel  enjoys  peaceful  relations  with  Egypt  and  Jor  dan,  and  open  contacts  with  the  Pales  tinians  and  many  others  of  our  Arab  and  Muslim  neighbours,  there  is  no   reason  for  other  Islamic  countries  to   persist  with  the  boycotts  of  the  past.   “Israel  shares  its  know-how  with  many  countries  around  the  world.  We  are  happy  to  do  the  same  with  Indonesia.  .   “For  such  mutually-beneficial  cooperation  to  develop,  we  need  to  be  able  to  talk  to  each  other.  We  need  to  understand  each  other  better,  and  to  remove  the  barriers  of  the  past,  so  that  we  may  build  cooperation  and  friendship  for  the  future.  Now  is  the  time  to  begin  this  dialogue.”   From  tiie  Indonesian  side,  the  Jakarta  Posts  New  York  correspon  dent,  Komelius  Purba,  reported  that  Indonesian  President  Susilo  Barn   bang  Yudhoyono  sees  opening  diplo  matic  contact  with  Israel  as  a  major  initiative  aimed  at  helping  the  Pales  tinian  Authority  to  improve  the  wel   fare  of  the  Palestinians.   Purba  reports  that  Yudhoyono,  at  the  New  York  summit,  agreed  with  Palestinian  Authority  President  Mah   moud  Abbas  to  act  as  interlocutor  between  the  Palestinians  and  Israelis.   Purba  said  many  Indonesians  oppose  contact  with  Israel  but  do  not  realise  that  several  Arab  countries  maintain  trade  and  diplomatic  rela   tions  with  Israel.

He  recalled  that  President  Yudhoy  ono  is  not  the  country’s  first  president  to  have  considered  initiating  diplo   matic  contacts  with  Israel.   In  1993,  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Yitzhak  Rabin  made  a  surprise  unoffi  cial  visit  to  President  Suharto,  who  received  him  at  his  private  residence.   Eight  years  later,  Abdurrahman  Wahid,  Indonesia’s  president  for  almost  two  years  until  July  2001,  was  talking  of  “ambitious  plans”  to  estab   lish  official  ties  with  Israel.

"  COMPARATIVE  DISGRACE   HOW  interesting  it  is  when  one  com-  pares  the  quantity  of  aid  to  tsunami  victims  given  by  the  West,  in  compar-  ison  to  that  provided  by  the  Muslim  and  Arab  world.  We  have  already  pro-  vided  a  $50  million  aid  package  with  a  promise  of  more  to  come  as  well  as  hardware  and  personnel.   Saudi  Arabia  has  provided  a  stingy  $10  million.  Syria  has  provided  zero.  Given  the  fact  that  Indonesia  is  78  per  cent  Muslim,  and  has  lost  more  than  100,000  people,  Sri  Lanka  is  eight  per-  cent  Muslim,  and  India  is  11  per  cent  Muslim,  one  would  think  that  Arab  nations  would  now  show  an  outpour-  ing  of  support  and  sympathy.   After  all,  isn’t  that  the  excuse  they  always  use  for  backing  the  “poor  Palestinians”  -  that  they  are  fellow  Muslims  and  their  solidarity  is  a  given?  So,  how  is  it  that  the  great  soli-  darity  of  the  Islamic  world  when  it  comes  to  their  “pride”  or  their  touchy  religious  sensibilities  doesn’t  extend   to  humanitarian  aid  when  thousands  of  Muslims  lie  dead  in  the  streets?  Where  are  the  much  touted  “Muslim   benevolent  funds”  when  you  really  need  them  for  something  other  than   guns  to  kill  Israelis  and  blow  up  planes  or  World  Trade  Centres?   Makes  one  think,  doesn’t  it,  that  perhaps  all  these  years  their  concern  for  the  plight  of  the  Palestinian  “refugees”  wasn’t  based  on  purely  humanitarian  grounds.  Let’s  just  see   how  charitable  Muslims  will  be  to  the   millions  of  Muslim  refugees  in  Asia  now,  people  who,  unlike  the  Palestini-  ans,  really  don’t  have  a  roof  over  their  heads  or  a  way  to  earn  a  living.

Canberra  Jewish  community  president  Bill  Arnold,  who  represented  ECAJ  presi-  dent  Grahame  Leonard,  told  the  AJN  that  gifts  would  be  tax-deductible  and  funds  would  be  channelled  through  aid  agencies  connected  with,  or  chosen  by,  the  five  organisations.   National  Council  of  Churches  in  Aus-  tralia  president  Professor  James  Haire,  co-  ordinating  the  launch  last  week,  said:  “We   want  to  get  completely  away  from  any  one’s  mind  that  Christian  money  simply  goes  to  Christians  and  Muslim  money  to   Muslims  and  so  on.”   Sri  Lankan  High  Commissioner  Major  General  Janaka  Perera,  representing  the  Federation  of  Australian  Buddhist  Coun-  cils,  said:  ""We  will  monitor  how  the  distri-  bution  is  done  to  ensure  equality  because  the  destruction  and  the  pain  and  suffering  is  uniform  everywhere.”   Sri  Lankan-born  Dr  Amir  Ali,  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  president,  said  multi-faith  co-operation  involving  local  people  with  better  knowledge  of  the  distressed  areas  could  help  to  overcome  logistic  and  language  problems.

"  left:  The  entrance  to  the  Israeli   Embassy  in  Canberra  ...  Appeals  to  lengthen  and  shorten  the  jail   term  of  Jack  Roche  (above),  who  plotted  to  blow  the  site  up,  were  rejected  last  week.     ROCHE'S  DWINDLING  SENTENCE?     BERNARD  FREEDMAN     MUSLIM  convert  Jack  Roche  may  eventually  spend  no  more  than  one  third  of  his  nine-year  sentence  in  jail  for  plotting  with  al-Qaeda  to  blow  up  the  Israeli  Embassy  in  Canberra  four   years  ago.   Legal  authorities  said  this  week  that,  taking  into  account  time  already  spent  in  custody  since  his  arrest  in  October  2002  and  the  possibility  of  parole,  Roche’s  time  behind  bars  could  possibly  be  reduced  to  about  three  years.   During  his  trial  last  May,  Roche  changed  his  plea  to  guilty  for  charges  of  conspiring  to  bomb  the  embassy.  Last  week  Western  Australia’s  Court  of  Criminal  Appeal  refused  to  accept  Roche’s  argument  that,  because  he   had  extensively  co-operated  with  Australian  investigators,  his  nine-year  sentence  should  be  reduced.  The  court  also  rejected  a  call  from  crown  prosecutors  for  the  sentence  to  be  doubled,  although  one  of  the  three  appeal  judges  had  argued  that  Roche’s  sentence  be  increased  to  15  years  with  a  nine-year  parole  period.   Roche,  the  first  man  to  be  convict-  ed  of  terrorist  activities  under  Aus-  tralian  law,  was  born  Paul  George  Holland  in  England  in  1954  and  came   to  Australia  in  1978.   He  converted  to  Islam  in  1992  in  an  effort  to  curb  a  drinking  problem  and  became  a  fully-fledged  member  of  Jemaah  Islamiah  (JI),  allied  to  al-  Qaeda,  in  1996.   He  met  JI  leaders  in  Australia  and  Malaysia  and  trained  as  a  terrorist  in   Pakistan  and  Afghanistan  where  he  met  Osama  bin  Laden  in  March  2000.   In  June  2000,  posing  as  a  tourist,  he  began  filming  outside  the  Israeli  Embassy,  but  JI  plans  for  the  bomb-  ing  of  the  embassy  were  called  off  because  of  disagreements  among  JI   leaders.   Roche  later  claimed  he  realised  the  enormity  of  actions  and  went  to  the  Australian  Security  Intelligence  Organisation  (ASIO),  but  “nobody  seemed  particularly  interested  in  what  was  going  on”.   It  was  only  after  the  Bali  bombings  in  October  2002  that  Australian  Feder-  al  Police  began  investigating  his  activi-  ties  and  he  was  arrested.  During  his  trial  Roche  also  told  the  court  of  plans  that  were  discussed  to  assassinate  Mel-  bourne’s  Rabbi  Joseph  Gutnick. ",2005-01-21
"  Jews  oppose  headscarf  ban,   say  yarmulkes  could  be  next   PETER  KOHN   IF  Muslim  hijabs  (headscarfs)  are  banned  at  state  schools,  yarmulkes  and  Chassidic  attire  could  be  next.   That’s  the  view  of  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Grahame  Leonard  on  federal  Liberal  back   bencher  Bronwyn  Bishop’s  call  this   week  for  a  ban  on  headscarfs  in  state  schools.   “What  she  is  proposing  is  totally   inconsistent  with  Australia’s  model  of  multiculturalism.  The  Australian  model  encourages  and  celebrates  diver  sity  and  I  think  our  community  would  support  continuing  that  policy,”  he   said.   Bishop’s  call  for  a  ban  on  hijabs  in  Australia’s  classrooms  and  school  play  grounds  was  echoed  by  Victorian  Lib  eral  backbencher  Sophie  Panopoloulos  and  by  Queensland  Liberal  Peter  Slip   per.   But  Leonard  said  any  ban  on  Mus  lim  headscarves  had  “a  definite   prospect”  of  leading  to  a  ban  on  out  ward  expressions  of  Judaism,  such  as  yarmulkes  and  Chassidic  garb.   Leonard  said  he  disagreed  with  Bishop’s  description  on  Seven’s  Sunrise  of  the  hijab  as  “a  sort  of  iconic  item  of   defiance”.   “It’s  the  women  observing  the  cul  tural  norms  of  their  belief  system,  just  as  many  Orthodox  Jews  wear  a  kippah   A  poster  for  an  Australian  debate  on  the  banning  of  the  Muslim  hijab  at  state  schools  in  France  last  year.   or  Orthodox  women  wear  a  wig,”  he   said.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  said  Australian  Mus  lim  women  who  peacefully  go  about  their  lives  should  have  the  right  to  choose  to  observe  their  religion  by  wearing  a  headscarf.   “We  applaud  the  stance  taken  by   Education  Minister  Brendan  Nelson  saying  he  does  not  support  a  ban  on   headscarves.”   Prime  Minister  John  Howard  also   opposed  the  ban,  telling  media:  “I  don’t  think  it’s  practical  to  bring  in  such  a  prohibition.  If  you  ban  a  headscarf,  you  might  for  consistency’s  sake  have  to  ban  a  yarmulke  or  a  turban.”   He  said  he  does  not  regard  a  ban  as  “a  practical  thing  or  even  a  desirable  thing”,  although  Bishop  had  a  right  to   her  views.   But  Howard  said  he  could  see  how   “people  might  be  affronted”  by  a  burqa,   which  covers  the  entire  face.   The  ban  proposal  was  also  rebuked  by  Citizenship  and  Multicultural  Affairs  Minister  John  Cobb,  who  slammed  attempts  to  enforce  “cultural   sameness”.   “Do  we  ban  nuns  from  wearing  a  habit,  do  we  ban  turbans,  kippahs  or  even  baseball  caps  and  akubras?”  Cobb   said  in  a  statement.   Jewish  Community  Council  of  Vic  toria  president  Michael  Lipshutz  described  the  proposal  as  “a  kneejerk  reaction  against  people  who  look  dif  ferent”  and  said  banning  headscarves   would  not  avert  terrorism.   “Bronwyn  Bishop  has  got  a  bit  of  hysteria  going.  What  do  you  ban  next?  Black  fedoras,  frock-coats  and  beards?”   Last  year  France  banned  the  wearing  of  all  visible  religious  symbols  at  state  schools,  including  hijabs,  yarmulkes  and  large  crosses.   4 ",2005-09-02

"  Silence  is  sometimes  golden   SHEIKH  Mohammed  Omran  is  a  radical  firebrand  Muslim  funda   mentalist  cleric  who  is  affiliated  with  a  Melbourne  bookshop  that  sells  hate  literature  and  whose  recent  outrageous  declarations  on  9/11  and  Osama  bin  Laden  have  infuriated  the  Australian  public,  including  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  and  members  of  the  Jewish  community.   Sheikh  Omrans  shenanigans  have  also  spawned  an  intriguing  turf  war  in  the  Jewish  community  in  Victoria.  On  one  side  is  the  Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victoria  (JCCV),  led  by  its  president,  Michael  Lipshutz,  who  sug  gested  initiating  dialogue  with  the  sheikh;  on  the  other  side  is  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry,  whose  president,  Grahame  Leonard,  believes  there  is  nothing  to  be  gained  from  dialogue  with  a  sheikh  who  does  not  rep  resent  the  Islamic  community.  Fortunately,  the  JCCV  has  now  backed  down  from  the  proposed  dialogue  because  the  race-hate  literature  has  been  removed  from  Sheikh  Omran’s  Brunswick  bookshop.   But  with  all  due  respect  to  such  laudable  Jewish  zeal,  we  believe  another  question  is  pertinent:  why  is  it  necessary  for  Jews,  as  such,  to  be  at  the  fore  front  of  a  campaign  -  for  or  against  -  Sheikh  Omran?  After  all,  the  recent  bombings  and  terror  attacks  that  have  occurred  in  New  York,  Madrid  and  most  recently  London  have  created  a  sea  change  in  western  public  opinion,  including  Australia’s.  It  is  now  increasingly  accepted  that  Islamic  incitement  and  terror  is  not  a  particularly  Jewish  or  Israeli  issue,  but  a  common  chal  lenge  facing  the  entire  western  world.  This,  in  fact,  has  alleviated  Israel’s  predicament  and  helped  to  convince  the  international  community  that  there  is  no  justification  for  incitement  or  terrorism,  under  any  circumstances.   In  the  same  vein,  Sheikh  Omran’s  issues  are  not  exclusive  to  the  Jewish  community  but  with  Australian  society  as  a  whole,  and  it  serves  no  good  purpose  for  Jews  to  jump  the  gun.  Fostering  dialogue  with  the  official  (and  generally  moderate)  Muslim  leadership  is  one  thing.  Taking  a  public  stance  -  one  way  or  another  -  in  the  efforts  to  deal  with  Sheikh  Omran  is  some  thing  else  altogether.  Silence  is,  sometimes,  golden.  Sheikh  Omran  and  his  ilk  are  an  Australian  problem,  not  a  Jewish  one,  and  should  remain  so. ",2005-08-05

"  Why  radical  Islamists  terrorise   Islamic  terrorism  reflects  first   and  foremost  atavistic  desires  of  frustrated  Muslims.   VIEWPOINT   EFRAIM  INBAR   For  the  radicals,  Israel  seems  to  be  a   continuous  reminder  of  I  the  failure  of  the  Muslim   I  world  to  regain  its  lost  I  power.   THE  recent  incidents  of  terror   ism  in  the  UK,  Turkey,  Egypt  and  Israel  are  not  necessarily   the  manifestation  of  a  coordi   nated  global  campaign  conducted  by  a  single  world-embracing  radical  Islamic  terrorist  organisation.  The  ter   rorist  attacks  are  a  result  of  local  initia   tives  by  radical  groups  loosely  united  by  their  hatred  for  the  West.  Generally,  the  West,  portrayed  as  decadent,  aggressive  and  exploitative,  is  blamed  for  all  the  ills  of  Islamic  societies.  Para   doxically,  it  is  feared  and  portrayed  as  tempting  the  Muslim  masses  by  its  hedonism  and  promiscuity.   The  acts  of  violence  perpetrated  by  the  terrorists  do  not  have  clearly  defined  political  objectives  and  mostly  do  not  aim  to  change  the  policies  of  the  states  attacked.  Indeed,  the  terror  ists  usually  do  not  make  demands  prior  to  the  perpetration  of  their  attacks.  In  this  respect,  these  acts  are  expressive,  rather  than  instrumental,  meaning  that  their  primary  functions  are  to  express  rejection  of  the  West,  and  feelings  of  revulsion  and  con  tempt  towards  western  culture.   The  religiously-motivated  Muslim  terrorists  dwell  on  the  splendour  of  past  Muslim  empires  and  are  frustrated  by  the  present  cultural,  economic  and  military  hegemony  of  the  West.  Their  anger  pushes  them  to  punish  westerners  just  for  being  themselves.  The  violence  is  not  serving  as  an   instrument  with  which  to  change  the  behaviour  of  the  westerners,  for  the  ter  rorists  have  no  intention,  or  hope  of  seeing  them  repent.  In  accordance  with  radical  Muslim  theology,  the  West  is  doomed  anyway.   ISLAMIC  terror  has,  however,  a   long-range  instrumental  goal  -  the  weakening  of  the  West  and  its  allies  within  the  Muslim  world.  This  is  a  residual  of  the  old  jihadist  impulse,  i.e.  to  bring  the  world  outside  Islamic  rule,  Dar  el-Harb  (literally  the  realm  of  the  sword),  under  Muslim  reign.   Clearly  cognisant  of  the  power  dif  ferential  with  the  western  powers  and  of  the  inability  to  vanquish  the  infidels  by  conventional  means,  terror  is  employed.  By  the  cumulative  effect  of  terror,  the  Muslim  radicals  hope  to  undermine  the  strength  and   Luimueiice  01  uie  vvesi,  iorcmg   it  to  divert  resources  to  defence,  rather  than  development.  Sep  tember  11  in  the  US  and  July  7  in  the  UK  are  examples  of  such   a  rationale.   Turkey  is  a  prime  target  for  destabilisation  because,  despite  its  Muslim  society,  it  is  a  self  declared  secular  republic,  which  has  relegated  Islam  to  the  pri  vate  sphere.  Its  western  orienta   tion  is  anathema  to  the  Muslim   militants.  Snatching  Turkey  away  from  the  western  orbit  would  be  a  great  victory  -  a  replay  of  the  1453  Muslim  con  quest  of  Constantinople,  the  capital  of  Christian  Byzantium.   Egypt,  the  most  important  Arab  state,  and  its  regime  have  long  ago  become  the  subject  of   Muslim  dissatisfaction.  Presi  dent  Anwar  Sadat  was  mur  dered  by  Muslim  extremists  for   allying  Egypt  politically  to  the  West  Heavy  Egyptian  presence  in  al-Qaeda  is  also  illustrative  of  this  point.   Israel  is,  of  course,  seen  as  a  western  bastion  and  agent  planted  in  the  midst  of  the  Arab  world.  The  Jewish  State,  located  within  what  is  regarded  as  Islamic  patrimony,  is  theologically  an  affront  to  the  radical  Muslim  prism  on   international  affairs.  The  success  of  a   few  million  Jews  in  surviving  the  enmity  of  the  whole  Arab  world  is  puzzling  and  frustrating.  For  the  radi  cals,  Israel  seems  to  be  a  continuous  reminder  of  the  failure  of  the  Muslim   world  to  regain  its  lost  power.   The  West  and  its  allies  face  a  deter  mined  enemy  armed  with  a  millennium-type  ideology  which  is  undeterred  by  temporary  setbacks.  The  first  requirement  for  combating   London   Underground   tapes  of  terrorism  suspects  In  the  July  21   failed  bombing  attempt  Photos:  JTA   this  terrorism  is  to  recognise  the  nature  of  the  threat.  Many  in  the  West  are  reluctant  to  call  a  spade  a  spade.  Political  correctness  prevents  many  of  the  “enlightened  circles”  from  identi  fying  the  problem  as  one  stemming   from  atavistic  desires  of  frustrated   Muslims.  Finding  solutions  for  the  ills   of  the  societies  of  the  Arab  world  -  an  ambitious  and  commendable,  but  elusive  goal  of  the  current  American  administration  -  may  take  genera  tions.  In  the  meantime,  terrorists  must  be  fought  and  the  damage  they  can  inflict  upon  the  West  must  be   minimised.   It  is  a  grave  mistake  to  view  terror  ism  as  a  criminal  activity  to  be  dealt  with  by  only  regular  police  measures.   The  terrorists’  war  turns  counter-ter  ror  into  a  war  for  the  defence  of  the   West  and  its  values.  Gearing  for  war   UKe  activities  is   different  from  police  opera  tions.  It  requires  appropri  ate  psychological  dis  positions,  legal  responses  and  security  preparations.  Moreover,  the  war  on  terror  is  a  protracted  conflict,  which  societies  must  accept  living  with.  Nevertheless,  with  the  right  leadership  the  West  can  win  this  struggle   as  well.

"  WHAT  ABOUT  MY  SENSIBIUT1ES?   NEW  photographs  of  Saddam  Hus  sein  in  his  underwear  are  apparently  bothering  numerous  people.  The  great  fear,  apparently,  is  “offending   Muslim  sensibilities”  The  fact  that  he  was  a  dictator  and  vicious  murderer   who  was  trying  his  best  to  emulate   Hitler  seems  to  be  irrelevant.  Humili  ation  of  such  an  individual  seems  to   me  to  be  entirely  appropriate  and  a  warning  to  other  upcoming  tinpot  despots.   Muslims  currently  form  approxi  mately  20  per  cent  of  the  world  pop  ulation.  That  means  that  80  per  cent  of  the  world  is  not  Muslim.

"  Muslims  to  attend  festival   MELISSA  SINGER   AMONG  the  expected  10,000  people  at  this  Sunday's  In  One  Voice  -  Concert  in  the  Park  festival  in  Melbourne  will  be  several  hajibs  (traditional  Muslim  dress)  interspersed  among  the  yarmulkes.   In  an  historic  first,  Jewish  and  Muslim  families  will  join  forces  at  the  festival  as  part  of  the  joint  B’nai  B’rith  Anti   Defamation  Commission  (ADC)-Australian  Intercultur  al  Society  (AIS)  initiative,  Building  Bridges:  Becoming  friends,  Jews  and  Muslims.   Building  Bridges,  which   launched  in  late  2004,  aims  to  break  down  cross-cultural   prejudices  by  bringing  Jewish  and  Muslim  families  together  in  a  social,  apolitical  setting.   AIS  director  Orhan  Cicek,  a  Turkish  Muslim,  told  the  AJN:  “There  is  caution,  there  is  hes  itation,  there  are  stereotypes,”  he  says.  “We  have  to  start  somewhere.  Neither  the  ADC,  nor  [In  One  Voice]  festival  organisers  can  control  individ  uals.  We  come  with  goodwill.  If  one  of  our  people  is  abused,  the  project  will  be  dimin   ished.”   Jewish  and  Muslim  members  of  the  Building  Bridges  program  at  a  recent  event.   Cicek,  who  joined  the  ADC’s  Julie  Ruth  to  form  Building  Bridges  last  year,  says  the  participants  from  both   communities  should  be  seen  as   “pioneers  and  role  models”.   “So  many  Muslim  hardlin  ers  have  criticised  me  and  my  colleagues  for  doing  these  projects,”  he  says.  “Psychologi  cally,  it’s  not  easy  to  change  community  actions  or  behav  iour.  We  are  testing  the  water.  If  [others]  see  that  it’s  okay,  it’s  going  to  slowly  and  surely  spread.”   Since  launching  last  December  at  a  Prahran  com   munity  centre,  the  20  families  involved  in  Building  Bridges  have  come  a  long  way.

So  this  stupid  idea  that  since  9/11  all  Muslims  can’t  be  trusted  -  it’s  an  age-old  stereo  type  without  any  basis,”  she  says.  “Muslims  in  Victoria  are  among  the  most  moderate,  peace-loving  citizens  who  want  nothing  to  do  with  violence.”   Concert  in  the  Park  was  established  in  1987  by  SKIF,  the  youth  movement  of  the  Jewish  Labour  Bund  in  Mel  bourne,  and  the  Kadimah.   -1 ",2005-03-18
"  Challenges  of  teenage  life   BOOK  REVIEW   STEPHANIE  KOMESAROFF   DOES  MY  HEAD  LOOK  BIG  IN  THIS?   Randa  Abdel-Fattah   Pan  Macmillan,  $16.95   BEING  a  teenager  is  not  easy.  For  some,  peer  pressure  is  a  problem.  For  others,  choosing  what  to  wear  to  the  next  party  is  a  major  issue.   On  top  of  all  this  is  the  quest  for  self-identity.  What  do  you  want  to  do  with  your  life?   The  question  of  religious  identity  can  be  a  major  part  of  this  quest.   Does  my  head  look  big  in  this?  is  a  novel  about  Amal  Hakim,  a  16-year   old  Australian  Palestinian  Muslim   who  is  going  through  her  own  reli  gious-identity  crisis,  something  she  resolves  by  deciding  to  wear  the  hijab  (Muslim  head  covering)  all  the  time.   This  is  not  an  easy  decision  and  is  made  even  harder  by  the  fact  that  Amal  is  the  only  Muslim  who  attends  her  private  school.   As  Amal  puts  it:  “It’s  hard  enough   being  an  Arab  Muslim  at  a  new  school  with  your  hair  tumbling  down  your  shoulders.  Shawling  up  is  just  plain  psychotic  ”   In  making  her  decision,  Amal  has  to  deal  with  the  prejudice  that  some  peo  ple  have  towards  Muslims  including  that  of  her  peers,  her  snooty  principal  Ms  Walsh  and  her  archenemy  Tia.   There  is  also  Adam  to  think  about,  the  boy  of  her  dreams.  To  make  things  even  more  complicated,  Amal  has  to  decide  what  colour  fabric  best  suits  her  eyes  and  how  best  to  wear  the  hijab  so  that  it  complements  her   features.   Does  my  head  look  big  in  this?  is  about  discovering  oneself  and  also  about  coming  to  an  understanding  of  what  it  means  to  be  a  good   friend.   In  discovering  her  own  identity  and  what  it  means  to  be  a  devout  young  Muslim  living  in  the  world  today,  Amal  encounters  many  chal  lenges  relating  to  her  religion  and  the   outside  world.   Does  my  head  look  big  in  this?  is  a  story  of  friendship,  high-school  dra  mas  and  the  pressures  of  family   and  friends.   This  book  teaches  us  that  despite  the  different  religions  we  may  follow,  the  struggles  and  challenges  of  ado  lescence  are  very  similar.

"  Between  Jakarta  and  Jerusalem   IT  is  easy  to  cast  off  the  article  published  in  the  Jakarta  Post  this  week  by   Israeli  Foreign  Minister  Silvan  Shalom  as  a  one-off  PR  stunt  to  capitalise  on  the  diplomatic  goodwill  Israel  is  experiencing  following  its  disengage  ment  from  Gaza  last  month.  And  it  is  even  easier  to  be  sceptical  about  its  long-term  prospects  for  improving  the  relationship  between  Israel,  the  Jewish  State,  and  Indonesia,  the  world’s  most  populous  Muslim  state.   But,  when  considered  in  the  context  of  the  dramatic  diplomatic  develop  ments  of  the  last  month,  Shalom’s  article  -  indeed,  its  very  publication  in  the  most  influential  English-language  newspaper  in  Indonesia  -  marks  a  historic  milestone  that  bodes  well  for  Israel  and  Jews  around  the  world,  including  Australia.  Now  a  window  of  opportunity  may  exist  —  not  necessarily  to  estab  lish  full  diplomatic  relations  with  Jakarta,  but  at  least  to  improve  on  the  cur   rent  low-level  trade  ties  that  exist.   This  conducive  climate  has  been  created  as  a  result  of  Israel’s  withdrawal   from  Gaza,  which  has  been  well  received  in  the  court  of  world  opinion,  espe  cially  at  the  UN  —  ordinarily  a  bastion  of  hostility  toward  Israel.   Both  Ariel  Sharon  and  Silvan  Shalom  were  sought  after  in  the  corridors  of  the  UN  by  the  foreign  ministers  of  a  dozen  or  so  Arab  and  Muslim  nations,  including  some  which  had  been  previously  unwilling  to  make  contact  with  the  Jewish  State.  Moreover,  Sharon’s  handshake  with  Pakistani  President  Per  vez  Musharraf,  followed  by  Musharraf  s  speech  to  the  American  Jewish  Con  gress  -  in  which  he  said  his  decision  to  initiate  official  contact  with  Israel  was  “in  response  to  the  bold  step  taken  by  Prime  Minister  Sharon  to  withdraw  from  Gaza”  -  confirmed  that  Israel  is  indeed  experiencing  a  post-disengage  ment  honeymoon,  relatively  speaking,  in  the  international  arena.   This  appears  to  have  created  a  new  diplomatic  detente,  not  dissimilar  to  what  Israel  experienced  after  the  signing  of  the  Oslo  Accords  in  1993  when  Jerusalem  established  diplomatic  relations  with  nine  non-Arab  Muslim  states,  opened  trade  ties  with  India  and  China  and  signed  a  peace  treaty  with  Jordan.  We  may  be  a  long  way  from  those  heights,  but  winds  of  change  appear  to  be  blowing  through  the  corridors  of  power  in  the  Arab  and  Muslim  world.   Much  of  the  credit  for  this  significant  shift  can  be  placed  squarely  at  the  doorstep  of  Sharon,  who  bulldozed  through  his  disengagement  plan  despite  strong  opposition  from  rebel  elements  inside  his  own  Likud  Party,  and  from  virtually  the  entire  settler  movement.   The  prescient  point,  however,  is  this:  when  much  of  the  goodwill  that  was  created  in  the  post-Oslo  period  disappeared  under  the  rubble  of  the  intifada,  it  was  the  non-Arab  Muslim  world  that  was  consumed  by  hostile  anti-Israel  rhetoric  spurring  divestments,  boycotts,  anti-Israel  motions  and  the  like.   It  is  therefore  of  more  than  passing  significance  that  a  country  such  as  Indonesia  is  showing  signs  of  a  partial  rapprochement,  which  will  hopefully   influence  the  Muslim  street  to  shed  its  anti-Israel  animus.   Even  the  Jakarta  Post,  while  stopping  short  of  encouraging  full  diplomatic  relations  with  Israel,  urged  its  government  to  open  low-level  ties  which,  it  edi  torialised,  “could  be  based  on  a  quid  pro  quo  of  Israel’s  adherence”  to  the  peace  process.  “If  the  peace  process  progresses  as  everyone  hopes,  the  oppor  tunities  of  engaging  with  the  Middle  East’s  most  modem  state  is  a  requisite  for  a  country  like  Indonesia,”  it  argued.   President  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono  has  said  that  Indonesia  should  play  a  bigger  role  in  the  peace  process.  This  would  not  only  be  welcome,  but  may  prompt  other  non-Arab  Muslim  countries  to  end  their  isolation  of  Israel.   The  Gaza  pullout  was  about  much  more  than  extricating  8000  settlers  from  their  biblical  birthright.  The  end  of  the  38-year  occupation  may  indeed  precipitate  the  beginning  of  a  new  era  for  Israel  as  a  nation  among  nations. ",2005-10-07
"  Jews  feast  with  Muslims  to  mark  end  of  fast   PETER  KOHN   JEWS  attended  two  major  functions  marking  the  end  of  the  Islamic  daily   fast  of  Ramadan  last  weekend.

"  Blair  nixes  advice  to  drop  Holocaust  Day   MATTHEW  WAGNER   LONDON   British  Prime   Minister  Tony  Blair  (pictured)   announced  this  week  that  he   would  not  adopt  a  proposal  to  change  the  British   Holocaust  Memorial  Day  to  a  British  Genocide  Day,  which  would  serve  as  a   memorial  to  Muslim  deaths  as  well  as  Holocaust  victims.   According  to  British  media  reports,  advisers  to  Prime  Minister  Blair  proposed  that  Holocaust  Memorial  Day  be  replaced  with  “Genocide  Day”.  The  new  memorial   day  would  commemorate  Muslim  deaths  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza,  Chechnya  and  Bosnia,  in  addition  to   Holocaust  victims.   The  recommendations  were  pre  pared  by  four  committees  that  Blair  appointed  after  the  recent  London  bombings  in  an  effort  to  combat   extremism.   Sir  Iqbal  Sacranie,  secretary  general  of  the  Muslim  Council  of  Britain  told  the  Sunday  Times:  “Mus  lims  feel  hurt  and  excluded  that  their   lives  are  not  equally  valuable  to  those   lives  lost  in  the  Holocaust.”  Ibrahim   Hewitt,  chairman  of  the  charity  Inter  pal,  said:  “There  are  500  Palestinian  towns  and  villages  that  have  been   wiped  out  over  the  years.  That’s  pret  ty  genocidal  to  me.”   Holocaust  Day  was  established  by   Blair  in  2001  after  a  sustained  cam  paign  by  Jewish  leaders  to  create  a  lasting  memorial  to  the  million   victims  of  Hitler.  It  is  marked  each   year  on  January  27,  the  date  of  the  lib  eration  of  Auschwitz.

Photo:   Joseph  Feil   Jews,  Muslims  share  historic  seder   MELISSA  SINGER   PESACH  may  still  be  a  week  away,  but  the  spirit  of  religious  freedom  was  alive  in  Mel  bourne  this  week  at  a  historic  model  inter  faith  seder  for  Jews  and  Muslims.   As  part  of  the  joint  B’nai  B’rith-Australian  Intercultural  Society  Building  Bridges  proj  ect,  around  80  Jews  and  Muslims  gathered  at  the  Prahran  Community  Centre  last  Sun  day  for  an  abridged  version  of  the  ritual  Passover  meal,  led  by  Temple  Beth  Israel's  senior  rabbi,  Fred  Morgan.   “It  reminds  us  that  we  are  required  to  speak  out  for  freedom  for  all  people,”  he   said.   To  accommodate  the  Muslim  partici  pants,  grape  juice  was  served  instead  of  wine  and  the  invocation  ‘Tshana  haba’ah   b'Yerushalayim""  was  omitted  from  the  edited  haggadah.   Rabbi  Morgan  told  the  AJN  that  the  omission  was  made  so  as  to  ""be  sensitive  to  the  foundations""  of  the  Building  Bridges  project  -  and  to  avoid  the  event  from  becoming  political.   ""The  aim  was  to  give  people  the  oppor  tunity  to  share  something,”  he  said.  ""We  did  n't  want  to  bring  things  in  that  would  force  them  to  confront  'thornier'  issues.   “The  reference  to  Yerushalayim  wasn't  there  from  earliest  times  ...The  key  thing  is  to  have  a  messianic  ideal,  not  to  necessar  ily  express  it  in  those  terms.”   Building  Bridges  Muslim  spokesman  Ortian  Cicek  said  the  Jewish  organisers  “showed  great  respect”  by  altering  the  serv  ice  to  accommodate  their  religious  beliefs.   Although  he  was  ""delighted  and  inter   ested  to  observe”  the  Pesach  rituals,  Cicek  couldn't  get  his  tastebuds  around  gefilte   fish.   ""I  can’t  get  along  with  that  fish,”  he  joked.   Jewish  spokesman  Walter  Rapoport  said:  “Muslims  seated  near  me  had  no  idea  what  they  were  coming  to  ...  It  was  just  thrilling  to  see  how  Jews  and  Muslims  felt  so   at  ease  with  one  another?   Building  Bridges,  which  launched  last  December  at  the  same  venue,  brings  10  Muslim  and  10  Jewish  families  together  for  various  social  and  educational  activities  throughout  the  year  to  foster  increased  tol  erance  between  the  two  communities.

"  Islamic  council  denies  using  Protocols   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   THE  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  (AFIC)  this  week  rejected  widely-published  claims  that  students  at  an  AFIC-organised  youth  camp  had  been  given  an  anti  semitic  forgery  as  an  educational   text.   Amjad  Ali  Mehboob,  AFIC  chief  executive  officer  who  has  been  asso  ciated  with  AFIC  for  almost  30  years,  said  he  was  coordinator  of  Islamic  relations  with  other  com  munities,  including  the  Jewish  community,  and  he  could  not  recall  ever  seeing  the  The  Protocols  of  the  Elders  of  Zion  publication.   Jeremy  Jones,  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  director  of  international  and  community  affairs,  told  the  AJN  he  thought  the   claims  were  not  reliable.   Jones  three  years  ago  was  a  sig  natory  with  Mehboob  and  14  other  religious  leaders  of  a  declaration  reaffirming  their  shared  commit  ment  to  peace  and  respect  for  human  dignity.   Irfan  Yusuf,  a  Sydney-based   lawyer,  last  week  told  radio  inter  viewers  he  had  been  given  The  Pro  tocob  of  the  Elders  of  Zion  at  an  AFIC  youth  camp.   He  told  the  AJN  this  had  hap  pened  in  1985  and  1987  and  said  that  although  the  books  might  not  represent  mainstream  Muslim  thought,  they  were  an  example  of  the  type  of  books  distributed  by  some  “allegedly  moderate”  peak   bodies.   Yusuf,  36,  a  former  Liberal  Party  federal  candidate,  attacked  the  choice  of  participants  to  represent  Muslims  at  Prime  Minister  John  Howard’s  summit  meeting  held  in   Canberra  last  week.   He  said  they  were  not  represen  tative  of  half  of  the  Muslim  com   munity  who  he  said  were  aged  under  35  and  mostly  born  and   raised  in  Australia.   Muslim  community  leaders  deliberately  try  to  keep  young  peo  ple,  women  and  those  bom  in  Aus  tralia  out  of  their  organisations,  he   said. ",2005-09-02
"  Irwin  blasts  Exodus  as   ‘old-fashioned  violence’   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   LABOR  backbencher  Julia  Irwin  this  week  described  the  biblical  story  of  the  Exodus  as  an  example  of  “good  old-fashioned  violence”  in  a  speech  defending  Muslims  against  “destructive  whisper  cam  paigns”.   In  Federal  Parliament,  she  attacked  the  use  by  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  and  others  of  the  term  Muslim  “fundamentalist”   when,  she  said,  they  really  meant   “violent  extremists”.   “But  when  it  comes  to  good  old  fashioned  violence,  the  Judeo  Christian  God  is  hard  to  beat.”   Irwin  then  catalogued  what  she  saw  as  the  violence  depicted  in  Exo  dus:  the  plagues,  the  slaughter  of  the  first-bom  and  the  looting  of  the  homes  of  the  Egyptian  families  mourning  their  dead.   “If  I  were  to  take  those  verses  as   written,  I  could  easily  associate  any  Christian  fundamentalist  with  a  dangerous  and  extreme  mindset,”   Irwin  said.   “But  we  are  more  likely  to  asso   ciate  the  term  ‘Christian  funda   mentalist’  with  psalm  singers  and  happy  clappers.”   Irwin  said  the  Anglican  Arch  bishop  of  Sydney,  Dr  Peter  Jensen,  in  a  recent  Boyer  lecture,  had  urged  the  adoption  of  the  biblical  history   of  Israel  “as  if  it  were  our  own”.   “But,”  she  said,  “unless  they  are   values  that  have  been  rendered  safe  for  human  consumption  and  purged  of  all  hypocrisy,  they  will  do  little  to  promote  tolerance  and  har  mony  and  even  less  to  promote  the  integration  of  the  followers  of  a  peaceful  [Muslim]  religion.”   Australia/Israel  8c  Jewish  Affairs  Council  executive  director  Dr  Colin  Rubenstein  said:  “Irwin’s   ignorance  is  compounded  by  her  arrogance.  Rather  then  analyse  Islamist  terrorism,  she  has  chosen  to  slander  Judaism  and  Christiani  ty.  Her  apologetics  and  blame  shift  ing  ignores  a  reality  in  which  Islamist  jihadists  wage  a  no-holds   barred  terrorist  war.   “Just  as  it  is  wrong  to  tar  the  peace-abiding  Muslim  majority  with  the  terrorist  brush,  we  must  never  allow  politically-correct  indulgence  of  the  sort  practiced  by  Julia  Irwin  to  blind  us  to  this  gen  uine  threat,  a  threat  shared  by  Christians,  Jews  and  Muslims,”  Dr  Rubenstein  said.

This  “new  antisemitism”,  according  to  experts  such  as  Dr  Daniel  Pipes,  Ita   mar  Marcus  and  Professsor  Dina  Porat   is  coming  from  extremists  within  the  Muslim  community,  and  an  alliance   with  the  radical  left.   The  AJN  editorial  criticised  Dr  Pipes  for  exaggerating  the  threat  from  radical  Islam.  However  the  problems  our  fellow  Jews  in  Europe,  South  America  and  elsewhere  are  facing  from   the  extremist  Muslims  is  fact.  Convict  ed  terrorist  Jack  Roche  testified  there  were  extremists  within  the  Australian   Muslim  community  willing  to  attack  Jews  and  Jewish  property.

The  threat  of  violence  to  Jews  worldwide  -  includ   ing  Australia  -  is  real.  Jewish  commen  tators  criticising  experts  such  as  Dr  Pipes  are  placing  Jews  in  more  danger.

"  JOCELYN  ROBUCK   AND  MARK  FRANKLIN   THERE  were  four  good  reasons  to  rejoice  at  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel  (NSTE)  last  Thursday  night,  as  a  special  spiritual  convergence  united  Christians,  Jews  and  Muslims.   More  than  200  devotees  of  each  religion  gathered  to  celebrate  the  festi  vals  of  Succot,  St  Francis  Day,  and  the  end  of  Ramadan.  It  was  standing  room  only  as  the  crowd  heard  songs  and  sto  ries  about  each  other's  religious  tradi   tions.   And  the  fourth  reason  to  celebrate?  Amir  Mesrinejad  and  Arta  Zahedi,  two  Muslim  refugees  from  Iran  who  were  both  recently  released  from  Villawood  Detention  Centre  after  six  years  as  asy  lum  seekers,  enjoyed  their  first  end-of  Ramadan  party  as  free  men.   ""It  really  was  a  special  night,""  said  storyteller  Donna  Jacobs  Sife,  who  hosted  the  evening.  ""Everyone  had  this  openness  of  spirit,  this  willingness  to  try  and  form  relationships  across  the  board,  and  this  beautiful  intention  to  learn  about  each  other.""   The  concert,  entitled  Rejoice,  fea  tured  Christian  gospel  singers  a  la  Sister  Act,  an  Indonesian  percussion  group  that  performed  a  piece  based  on  the  Muslim  call  to  prayer;  and  the  NSTE  choir  which  performed  original  music  composed  for  the  psalms  of  the   Hallel.   Inter-faith  musicians  perform  at  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel  (from  left):  Anita  Meiruntu,  Ron  Reeves.   Photo:  Justine  Perl   NSTE's  performance  hall  was  draped  with  fabric  to  resemble  a  desert  tent  and  in  the  audience  sat  Muslim  women  in  headscarves,  priests  in  white  robes  and  Jewish  men  in  kippot.   Storytellers  from  all  three  religions  regaled  the  crowd,  and  Jacobs  Sife  invoked  a  Torah  fable  to  demonstrate  that  the  three  religions  could  achieve  great  things  in  overcoming  their   differences.   The  idea  for  the  program  emerged  when  NSTE  choir  director  Judy  Campbell  realised  there  would  be  an  approximate  convergence  of  Succot,  the  conclusion  of  Ramadan,  and  the  feast  of  St  Francis.   ""We  realised  later  that  it  was  actu  ally  a  rare  occurrence,  as  it  will  be  30  years  before  these  three  holidays  occur  again  at  the  same  time,""  Campbell   said.   One  of  the  organisers,  Rebecca  Dreyfuss,  said:  ""You  never  know  what  the  effects  of  an  experience  like  this  might  have  on  the  future.  If  everyone  here  left  with  a  happy,  positive  feeling  for  other  members  of  the  different  faiths,  then  we  have  truly  accom  plished  a  great  deal."" ",2005-10-28
"  Israeli-Pakistani  breakthrough   ISTANBUL  -  Pakistani  Foreign  Min  ister  Khursheed  Mehmood  Kasuri  met  last  week  in  Istanbul  with  his  Israeli  counterpart,  Silvan  Shalom,  in  the  highest-level  encounter  ever  between  the  two  nations.   Pakistani  leaders  said  the  meeting  was  appropriate  now  that  Israel  has  evacuated  the  Gaza  Strip,  but  warned  that  diplomatic  relations  were  not  pos   sible  until  Israel  concluded  a  final-sta  tus  peace  treaty  with  the  Palestinians.   Shalom  hailed  the  meeting  as  “his  toric”  and  said  that  following  the   Gaza  withdrawal  it  is  “the  time  for  all  of  the  Muslim  and  Arab  countries  to  reconsider  their  relations  with  Israel.”   Contrary  to  media  reports,  Pak  istani  President  Pervez  Musharraf  will  not  meet  with  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  when  the  two  are  in  New  York  later  this  month  to  attend  a  session  of  the  UN  General  Assembly,  the  Pak  istani  Foreign  Ministry  said  in  a  state  ment  Saturday.   Pakistani  Foreign   Minister   Khursheed   Kasuri  (left)  shakes   hands  with  his  Israeli   counterpart,  Silvan   Shalom,  in  Istanbul,  Turkey.   Photo:  AAP   Political  sources  said,  however,  that  Sharon  and  Foreign  Minister  Sil  van  Shalom  may  meet  for  the  first   time  with  Indonesian  President  Susi   lo  Bambang  Yudhoyono.  Israeli  offi  cials  said  the  Gaza  pullout  has  improved  Israel’s  image  in  the  Mus  lim  world,  and  may  lead  to  improve  ment  of  relations  with  non-Arab  Muslim  nations.   Musharraf,  in  any  case,  is  due  to  address  a  major  Jewish  event  in  New  York,  hosted  by  the  American  Jewish  Congress  (AJC).   The  AJC  was  largely  responsible  for  the  breakthrough  with  Israel,  according  to  American  Jewish  sources.  The  group  established  rela  tions  with  the  Pakistanis  several  years  ago,  first  through  the  local  Pakistani   community  in  the  US  and  later  directly  with  the  Pakistani  govern   ment.   These  relations  reached  their  peak  last  May,  when  three  senior  officials  of  the  AJC  -  Jack  Rosen,  Phil  Baum  and  David  Twersky  -  went  secretly  to   Islamabad  to  meet  with  Musharraf.   The  meeting  lasted  90  minutes   and  focused  on  the  issue  of  establish   ing  diplomatic  ties  between  Pakistan   and  Israel.   Though  Musharraf  stressed  in  the  meeting  that  he  will  not  have  full  diplomatic  ties  with  Israel  before  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  is  resolved,  he  did  show  willingness  to  begin  dis  cussions  about  the  issue,  provided  there  “is  a  feeling  that  the  efforts  to  resolve  the  conflict  are  moving  for  ward”,  as  one  of  those  who  attended  the  meeting  phrased  it.

"  To  ban  or  not  to  ban?   REVELATIONS  that  bookshops  in  Sydney  and  Melbourne  are  sell-   ing  race-hate  literature  promoting  jihad  and  suicide  bombings  are  deeply  disturbing,  but  hardly  surprising  -  even  in  modem,  multi-   cultural  Australia.   Radical  Muslim  leaders  have  been  inspiring  extremist  elements  within  their  ranks  for  years  by  delivering  sermons  laden  with  vitriolic  invective.  Wit-  ness  Sydney’s  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly  -  whose  litany  of  verbal  attacks  on  Jews  dates  back  to  1988  —  and  Melbourne’s  Sheikh  Mohammed  Omran  —  who  maintains  that  Muslims  had  nothing  to  do  with  9/11  or  7/7.   At  face  value,  books  such  as  Defence  of  Muslim  Lands,  by  Sheikh  Abdullah  Azzam,  which  carries  a  front-page  endorsement  by  Osama  bin  Laden  and  offers  suicide  bombing  techniques,  appear  to  incite  violence.  Unsurprisingly,  it  was  discovered  in  the  Islamic  Bookstore  in  Lakemba,  where  Sheikh  Hilaly  is  the  local  imam.  Another  book,  this  time  found  in  a  bookshop  adjacent  to  where  Sheikh  Omran  delivers  his  sermons  in  Melbourne,  states  that  the  “[Jew  or  Christian]  who  insults  the  Prophet  [Mohammed]  should  be  killed”.  On  both  counts  Jews  should  be  deeply  concerned.   In  an  ideal  world,  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  booksellers  and  authors  of  these  poisonous  Wahabbist  diatribes  should  be  vigorously  investigated  and  prosecuted.  In  practice,  however,  the  status  of  the  law  is  far  more  complex.  For  starters,  the  law  differs  between  states.  Victoria,  Queensland  and  Tasmania  have  racial  and  religious  vilification  laws,  but  New  South  Wales,  Western  Aus-  tralia  and  South  Australia  do  not.  Federal  anti-terror  laws  have  also  been  mentioned  in  this  context,  but  again  it  is  unclear  whether  this  hate  literature   constitutes  a  crime.   There  is  also  the  claim,  which  must  be  considered,  that  attempts  to  censor  freedom  of  speech  will  not  purge  hate  literature  but  simply  force  it  under-  ground.  Moreover,  what  appears  in  print  is  readily  available  on  the  internet,  which  makes  banning  such  material  virtually  futile.   Indeed,  whether  or  not  the  law  can  be  invoked  to  ban  such  books,  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  most  effective  way  to  drive  these  books  -  and  their  odious  ideas  -  into  pulp  is  to  win  the  war  of  ideas  on  the  Muslim  street.   Moderate  Muslims,  in  particular  the  leadership  of  the  Islamic  communi-  ty,  must  therefore  appeal  to  their  own  flock  to  stem  the  tide  of  hatred  that  emanates  from  extremists  in  its  ranks.  The  fatwa  issued  in  London  this  week   by  more  than  500  imams,  who  describe  suicide  bombings  as  “vehemently  prohibited”,  is  an  important  start.  Australian  Islamic  leaders  would  do  well  to  follow  their  example. ",2005-07-22
"  Musharraf’s  Jewish  breakthrough   CHANANTIGAY   NEW  YORK  -  It  was  a  remarkable   sight:  the  president  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  sitting  on  a  New  York  dais  alongside  leaders  of  the  American  Jewish  community  and  Israel’s  ambassador  to  the  ‘United  Nations,  eating  a  kosher  dinner  beneath  a  blue-and-white  banner  reading  “Council  for  World  Jewry”.   It  was  all  the  more  notable  consid   ering  the  significant  personal  risk  the  appearance  must  have  entailed  for  Per  vez  Musharraf,  who  has  been  the  sub  ject  of  several  recent  assassination  attempts  at  the  hands  of  Muslim  extremists  who  are  violently  anti-Israel   and  anti-America.   And  indeed,  there  was  near-unani  mous  agreement  among  Jews  and  Pakistanis  at  the  event  that  Mushar  rafs  mere  presence  before  an  audience  of  Jewish  officials  represented  a  poten   tiaUy-historic  step  in  Muslim-Jewish   relations.   For  his  landmark  gesture,  the  Pak  istani  general  received  a  series  of  standing  ovations.   “I  would  never  have  imagined  that  a  Muslim,  a  president  of  Pakistan  and,  more  than  that,  a  man  in  uniform  would  ever  get  such  a  warm  reception  from  the  Jewish  community,”  Mushar  raf  said  as  he  ascended  the  platform  to  excited  applause.   Musharraf’s  address  followed  closely  on  the  heels  of  his  brief  encounter  last  week  with  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  on  the  sidelines  of  the  United  Nations  World  Summit   and  a  recent  meeting  between  the  for  eign  ministers  of  the  two  countries,  which  do  not  have  full  diplomatic  ties.   But  challenged  by  Anti-Defama  tion  League  chairman  Abraham  Fox  man  to  show  more  leadership  by  moving  to  formalise  Israeli-Pakistani   relations  right  away,  Musharraf  responded  that  “57  years  of  hatred,  bit  terness,  and  animosity  cannot  be   undone  so  fast”.   “It  is  my  sincere  judgment  that  this  is  not  the  time  to  do  it,”  he  said  “We  need  to  be  very  patient.  I  need  some   more  reasons  and  rationale.  I  need   some  more  support”  to  be  able  to  con  vince  the  Pakistani  people  to  go  along   with  the  move.   While  he  referred  to  the  movie   Schindler’s  List  and  praised  Sharon  for  the  recent  Gaza  Strip  withdrawal,  Musharraf  upset  many  in  the  audience  by  insisting  that  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  is  a  root  cause  of  world  terror   ism  and  that  Pakistan  won’t  forge  diplomatic  ties  with  Israel  until  the  Palestinians  have  a  state  -  essentially  giving  the  Palestinians  a  veto  over  the  entire  process,  several  Jewish  leaders   noted  afterward.   Nonetheless,  “I  think  the  event  was   Pervez   Musharraf  speaking  at  the   Council   for  World  Jewry.   Photo:JTA   very  significant,”  said  Malcolm  Hoen  lein,  the  executive  vice-chairman  of  the  Conference  of  Presidents  of  Major  American  Jewish  Organisations.  “The  fact  that  it  took  place;  the  president  of  Pakistan  met  with  Jewish  leaders  and  it  was  broadcast  to  his  home  country.  Was  it  everything  everybody  wanted  to   hear?  Probably  not.   JlA ",2005-09-23
"  Sharon  slams  London’s  Livingstone   AJN  STAFF   PRIME  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  has   lambasted  London  Mayor  Ken  Living  stone  for  his  “ignorance”  in  having  declared  that  members  of  the  Likud  and  Hamas  were  “two  sides  of  the  same  coin”.   Sharon  said  he  expected  Living  stone  to  apologise  for  his  remarks.   Livingstone  enraged  Israelis  last  week  by  defending  the  use  of  suicide  bombers  in  the  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  and  charging  that  Israel  had  indiscriminately  slaughtered  Pales  tinians  in  acts  that  “border  on  crimes  against  humanity”.   Speaking  to  Sky  News  in  an  inter  view,  Livingstone  also  said  that  he  does  not  distinguish  between  mem  bers  of  Likud  and  Hamas,  branding   them  “two  sides  of  the  same  coin.”   “The  comparison  drawn  by  the  mayor  of  London  was  grave  and  inap  propriate,”  Sharon  said  of  Living   stone’s  comments.  “It  indicates  ignorance  and  a  basic  misunderstand  ing  of  reality.”   Sharon  added:  “I  expect  the  mayor  of  London  to  listen  to  the  reactions   London  Mayor  “Red  Ken”  Livingstone  (left):  “Hamas  and  Likud  are  the  same.”  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon:  Livingstone’s  remarks  are  “grave  and  inappropriate”.   stirred  by  his  comments,  and  that  he  apologise.   “Livingstone  is  a  lackey  of  the  Muslim  agenda.”   JON  BENJAMIN  Director  general  of  the  Board  of   Deputies  of  British  Jews   The  Hamas  is  a  murderous  organ   isation  that  has  killed  thousands  of   Israelis.  Such  antisemitic  comparisons  are  improper  and  European  govern   ments  should  address  them.”   Livingstone’s  comments  came  less  than  two  weeks  since  the  first  wave  of  London  bombings.  More  than  50  people  died  in  four  London  blasts  on  underground  trains  and  a  bus.  The  bombings  were  believed  to  have  been  carried  out  by  suicide  terrorists.   “Given  that  the  Palestinians  don’t  have  jet  planes,  don’t  have  tanks,  they   only  have  their  bodies  to  use  as  weapons,”  Livingstone  told  Sky  News  in  an  interview.  “In  an  unfair  balance,  that’s  what  people  use.”   Israeli  Ambassador  to  the  UK  Zvi   Heifetz  described  Livingstone’s  stance  as  “outrageous”  and  “shameful”  while  Labour  peer  Lord  Janner  said  his  words  were  “a  betrayal  of  the  hun  dreds  of  innocent  people  who  suffered  from  the  terrorist  barbarism  in  London”.   Jon  Benjamin,  director  general  of  the  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  was  even  more  outspoken,  telling  the  Israeli  website  Ynetnews  that  Livingstone  is  “a  lackey  of  the  Muslim  agenda  in  this  country”.   Livingstone  has  been  compared  to  Qatari  Muslim  cleric  Yussuf  Qartawi,  who  supports  Palestinian  suicide  bombings.  Henry  Grunwald,  presi  dent  of  the  Board  of  Deputies,  said,  “It  is  absurd  that  the  mayor  should  parrot  Qartawi’s  apologia  for  the  indiscrimi  nate  mass  murder  of  Israeli  civilians.”   Speaking  on  Channel  4  News,  Liv  ingstone  had  described  Qartawi  as  “one  of  the  most  progressive  Islamic  theologians  in  the  world”.

"  LEGENDARY  HAGGADAH  TO  GO  ON  SALE   SARAJEVO  -  It  survived  the  Span  ish  Inquisition,  Nazi  invaders,  the  Bosnian  war  and  the  ravages  of  time.  Now,  for  the  first  time,  replicas  of  the  600-year  old  Sarajevo  Hag  gadah  (pictured)  are  to  be  sold  to  the  public.   A  total  of  613  replicas  of  the  doc   ument  are  to  be  printed  and  made  available  by  next  Pesach,  Jakob  Finci,  the  head  of  the  Jewish  community  in  Bosnia,  told  the  Associated  Press.  “We  decided  to  print  613  replicas  as  there  are  613  mitzvot,”  Finci  said.   Finci  said  the  replicas  will  look  exactly  the  same  as  the  original,  and  will  be  printed  on  pergament  (calf   skin)  with  leather  covers.  “We  estimate  that  the  price  of  a  single  replica  will  be  around  $A1600,”  he  said.   The  original  is  displayed  at  Saraje  vo’s  National  Museum,  where  the  hag  gadah  is  in  a  climate-controlled  room  shared  by  manuscripts  of  Bosnia's  other  religions  -  Islam,  Orthodox  Chris  tianity  and  Roman  Catholicism.   Handwritten  in  Hebrew  on  bleached  calfskin,  the  109-page  Sarajevo  Hag  gadah  was  presented  as  a  wedding  gift  in  the  14th  century  to  a  young  couple   in  Barcelona,  Spain.   During  World  War  II,  a  Catholic  museum  director  and  his  Muslim  col  league  saved  the  book  from  a  Nazi  offi  cer  who  came  to  pick  it  up.  The  two  men  spirited  the  book  through  Nazi  checkpoints  and  carried  it  to  a  village  in  the  mountains  above  Sarajevo,  where  a  Muslim  cleric  kept  it  hidden  beneath  the  floor  of  a  mosque  until  the  end  of  the  war.  It  was  then  returned  to  the  museum  safe.   JERUSALEM  POST ",2005-09-16
"  Sensible  security  laws  should  have  bipartisan  support   MICHAEL  DANBY   The  Labor  Parly  will  hopefully   support  the  governments  anti  terror  bills,  which  do  not  mark   the  end  of  democracy  -  despite  the  claims  of  some  civil  libertarians.   Survivors  of  the  Shoah,   who  have  experienced  a  real  police  state,  will   know  how  absurd  the   claim  by  civil  libertarians  that  this  new  legislation  marks  the  end  of  democracy  is.   jfHEN  Federal  Parliament  meets  next  week  for  the  final   sittings  for  2005,  we  will  be  debating  the  government’s  new  round   of  anti-terrorism  laws,  introduced  m  the  wake  of  the  London  and  Bali   bombings.  Although  the  Shadow  Cabinet  has  not  yet  made  a  formal  decision,  I  am  confident  that  Labor  will  be  supporting  these  bills.   Over  the  past  few  weeks  we  have  seen  a  barrage  of  criticism  of  the  bills  from  the  usual  chorus  of  unilateral  civil  libertarians  in  the  media  as  if  the   murder  by  terrorist  suicide  bombers  of  a  further  four  Australians  in  Bali  only  three  weeks  ago  never  happened.  If  we  believed  these  people,  it  would  seem   that  the  new  laws  mark  the  end  of  Aus   tralian  democracy  and  the  imminent  arrival  of  a  fascist  police  state.   Survivors  of  the  Shoah,  who  have  experienced  a  real  police  state,  will   know  how  absurd  this  is.  I  have  been   committed  to  civil  liberties  all  my  life,  which  was  one  of  the  reasons  I  joined  the  Labor  Party.  Neither  I  nor  the  labor  Party  would  support  anything  that  restricted  the  legitimate  civil  lib  erties  of  Australians.  That  is,  after  all,  what  we  are  defending  in  the  current  war  against  people  who  are  trying  to  impose  their  perverted  form  of  Islam   ic  fascism  on  the  world.  Remember  the  promise  of  Hamas  only  last  week  that  all  gays  would  be  murdered  if  they  were  in  charge?   In  2004  the  parliament  passed  a  series  of  important  anti-terrorism  laws  on  a  bipartisan  basis,  and  under  our   existing  laws,  18  terrorist  organisations   from  Hamas  to  Palestinian  Islamic  Jihad  have  been  banned  in  Australia,  with  the  support  of  both  sides  of  poli  tics.  As  the  Labor  premiers  have  made  clear,  bipartisan  support  for  sensible  security  legislation  will  continue.  Now  that  the  government  has  control  of  the  Senate  the  Opposition  will  not  have  the  power  to  amend  these  bills.  The  government  should  not  abuse  this  position  by  pushing  through  measures  that  do  not  have  bipartisan  support   This  would  undermine  the  national   consensus  about  the  need  to  strength  en  our  security.   The  critics  of  the  new  bills  usually  make  two  allegations  -  that  the  bills  give  too  much  power  to  security  organisations  such  as  the  Australian  Security  Intelligence  Organisation  (ASIO),  and  that  they  “single  out”  the  Muslim  community.  I  don’t  accept  either  of  these  allegations.   The  Australian  Labor  Party  and  ASIO  have  not  always  had  a  friendly  relationship.  Although  ASIO  was  founded  by  Labor  prime  minister  Ben  Chifley  in  1949,  during  the  Cold  \Var  it  was  too  often  used  by  Liberal  gov  ernments  for  political  purposes,  spy  ing  on  some  domestic  dissidents  who  were  no  threat  to  national  security.   But  this  hostile  relationship  was  ended  by  ASIO  director-general  Justice  Edward  Woodward,  appointed  by  Gough  Whitlam  in  1975.   Woodward  changed  ASIO  into  a  professional  and  non-partisan  agency,  providing  both  government  and  Opposition  with  impartial  intelligence  briefings.  This  tradition  of  non-parti  san  professionalism  has  been  contin  ued  by  the  recently-departed  ASIO   chief  Dennis  Richardson  and  Australian  Federal  Police  chief  Mick  Keelty.   There  is  no  evidence  that  ASIO  has   abused  its  powers  or  pursued  a  politi  cal  agenda  in  recent  times.  Giving  ASIO  the  powers  it  needs,  with  appro  priate  parliamentary  supervision,  to  tackle  the  terrorist  threat  is  an  obvious   and  necessary  step.  It  is  extremely  rele   vant  to  this  debate  to  note  that  in  Woodward’s  recently-published  mem  oirs  he  notes  that  “the  threat  of  Aus  tralia  being  used  as  a  base  for  a  terrorist  attack  abroad  had  increased.  Two  Aus   tralian  citizens  received  weapons  train  ing  and  fought  on  behalf  of  Palestinian  terrorist  groups  in  Lebanon.  A  third  died  in  the  fighting.”   The  great  majority  of  Muslims  in  Australia  want  nothing  more  than  to  live  in  peace  and  enjoy  the  freedom  and  prosperity  that  Australia  offers.  There  is,  however,  a  small  minority  who  have  been  seduced  into  support  ing  the  hateful  ideology  of  Jihadism,  and  a  few  have  gone  so  for  as  to  train  overseas  with  al-Qaeda  or  similar  groups.  Yet  as  we  have  seen  in  London,   even  a  small  group  can  plan  and  carry   out  a  terrorist  attack.   In  these  circumstances  I  think  the   surveillance  and  prevention  provisions  of  the  new  bills,  such  as  the  “control  orders”  which  would  restrict  the  activ  ities  of  named  individuals  believed  to  be  potential  terrorist  recruits,  are  a  necessary  evil.  I  don’t  see  this  as  “scape  goating”  the  Muslim  community.  I  see  it  as  protecting  them  from  a  backlash  that  might  fallow  a  terrorist  attack  in  Australia.  In  the  Netherlands,  the  gov  ernment  is  proposing  banning  Muslim  women  from  wearing  the  burqa  in  public  -  the  kind  of  scapegoating  I  hope  we  never  see  in  Australia.   I  don’t  deny  that  the  majority  of  those  affected  by  these  laws  will  be  Muslims.  The  Australian  Muslim  com   munity  has  a  problem  with  the  impor  tation  of  Islamist  ideology  by  a  handful  of  fanatics,  which  its  leaders  need  to  do  something  about,  rather  than  looking  for  other  people  to  blame.   But  not  all  terrorist  recruits  in  Aus  tralia  have  come  from  the  Muslim  immigrant  community.  According  to  a  film  made  by  his  supporters,  David  Hicks,  motivated  by  anti-Jewish  big  otry,  trained  with  Lashkar-i-Toiba  in  Pakistan  and  with  al-Qaeda  in  Afghanistan.  If  we  had  had  these  pre  ventive  laws  a  few  years  ago,  a  deluded  individual  such  as  Hicks  might  have  been  saved  in  time  from  his  own  folly.

"  BERNARD  FREEDMAN   PAKISTAN’S  President  General  Pervez   Musharraff  has  indicated  he  is  willing  to  talk  to  Israel  about  the  campaign  against  terrorism.   Prime  Minister  John  Howard  revealed  this  on  Tuesday  after  meeting  Musharraff  in  Islamabad  during  a   brief  visit  to  Pakistan.   The  Muslim  state  currently  has  no  diplomatic  ties  with  Israel,  but  in  a  brief  comment  to  journalists  after  the   meeting,  Howard  said:  “We  discussed  just  a  few  moments  ago  the  desirabili  ty  of  keeping  the  process  going  for  the  Middle  East  peace  settlement.   “It  is  psychologically  still  a  very  important  issue  in  the  context  of  the  campaign  against  terrorism.”   Referring  to  Musharraff,  he  added:  “I  particularly  respect  the  way  in  which  you,  sir,  have  responded  to  the  actions  of  the  Israelis  in  pulling  out  of  the  settlements  and  the  willingness  on  your  part  to  talk  to  Israel,  consistent  of   course  with  your  long-stated  support  for  the  emergence  of  an  independent   Palestinian  state.”   Musharraff  made  no  reference  to  Israel  or  the  Middle  East  in  his  brief  statement.  A  transcript  of  the  com  ments  was  released  in  Canberra.   Later,  at  a  joint  media  conference  with  Pakistan’s  Prime  Minister   Shaukut  Aziz,  Howard,  stressing  Pak  istan’s  place  as  the  second  most  popu  lous  Islamic  country  in  the  world,  called  for  Muslims,  Jews  and  Chris  tians  to  fight  terrorism  together.   “It  is  tremendously  important  that  in  fighting  terrorism  we  stress  the  commonality  of  principles  of  the  world’s  great  religions,”  he  said.   “It  is  no  part  of  the  practice  of  Islam  to  support  or  espouse  terrorism.  Be  we  Muslim,  Jew  or  Christian,  or  indeed  any  other  religion,  we  all  have  in  common  the  great  principles  of  peace  and  world  brotherhood.”   At  a  United  Nations  summit  in   New  York  in  September,  Musharraf  and  Ariel  Sharon  shook  hands  in  a  brief  encounter  in  a  corridor.

The  red  Star  of  David  will  continue  to  be  used  inside  Israel,  but  when  on  inter  national  missions  and  for  fundraising,  MDA  can  be  represented  by  a  red  star  inside  a  red  ""crystal"",  essentially  a  dia  mond-shaped  frame,  or  an  empty  red  crystal  when  a  red  Star  of  David  could  jeopardise  its  staffers.  MDA  has  been  denied  membership  in  the  movement  for  nearly  60  of  its  75  years  of  existence  because  of  opposition  by  Muslim  coun  tries  who  used  the  pretext  of  an  unrecog  nised  symbol  to  keep  it  out.   A  special  session  of  countries  that  are  members  of  the  International  Red  Cross  Movement  will  open  on  December  5  in  Geneva  to  approve  the  crystal  symbol,  which  can  also  be  used  by  other  national  first-aid  and  humanitarian-rescue  soci  eties,  such  as  in  Eritrea  and  Kazakhstan,  that  do  not  use  the  Red  Cross  or  Red  Crescent  symbol.   Under  the  new  agreement,  which  was  stated  to  have  “no  diplomatic  implica  tions”,  MDA  recognises  the  PRCS’s  right  to  treat  Palestinian  patients  inside  Pales  tinian  Authority  territories,  while  the  PRCS  recognises  MDA’s  right  to  treat  Israeli  cit  izens  inside  Israel  and  in  the  territories,  eastern  Jerusalem  and  the  Jewish  settle   ments.   The  need  for  the  Palestinian  society’s  signature  was  the  last  roadblock  to  MDA's  international  recognition  in  the  Red  Cross  Movement,  as  Arab  and  Muslim  countries  can  no  longer  object  if  the  PRCS  recog   nises  mua,  said  Yifrach.

"  Plan  to  meet  Sheikh  Omran  shelved   PETER  KOHN   THE  Jewish  Community  Council  of  Victoria  (JCCV)  has  ditched  plans  for  a  meeting  with  a  radical  Islamic  cleric  aimed  at  removing  race-hatred  books  from  a  Brunswick  bookshop.   Although  earlier  stating  he  was  prepared  to  sit  with  Sheikh  Mohammed  Omran  in  talks  that  were  mooted  for  this  week,  JCCV  president  Michael  Lipshutz  said  the  moderate  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria  (ICV)  informed  it  that  the  books  had  been  taken  off  the  shelves.   Lipshutz  said  an  executive  meeting  of  the  JCCV  on  Monday  evening   decided  to  abandon  the  idea  of  a  meeting  with  the  fundamentalist  sheikh,  which  was  initially  to  have   been  mediated  by  ICV  representa   tives.   He  said  he  had  earlier  received   advice  from  his  federal  counterpart,  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  president  Grahame  Leonard,  not  to  meet  Sheikh  Omran  under  any   circumstances.   Leonard  told  the  AJN  this  week  that  the  ECAJ  viewed  the  Muslim  cler  ic  as  unfit  to  negotiate  with.   He  said  there  was  no  value  in  try  ing  to  talk  to  the  sheikh,  who  claimed  last  month  that  the  United  States  gov  ernment  had  planned  the  September  11  catastrophe  and  that  there  was  no  proof  that  Osama  bin  Laden  was  involved  in  terrorism.   “The  ECAJ  views  Sheikh  Omran  as  someone  who  does  not  have  the  sup   port  of  the  broader  Muslim  commu  nity  or  of  Islamic  leaders,”  Leonard  said,  noting  also  that  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  had  condemned  the  imam’s  comments.   Lipshutz  said  a  meeting  with  Sheikh  Omran  had  initially  been  pro  posed  by  the  ICV  but  that  the  Victori  an  Islamic  peak  body  had  later  changed  its  mind.   But  he  said  if  there  had  been  a  need  to  meet  with  the  cleric,  the  JCCV  would  have  proceeded.  “I  received  advice  from  Grahame  Leonard.  It  was  not  a  directive.

The  conference  brings  together  150  leaders  of  the  two  faiths,  allow-  ing  them  an  opportunity  to  meet   face-to-face  and  discuss  the  issues.   Speaking  before  the  opening  ceremony,  Dr  Abduljalil  Sajid,  a  senior  figure  in  the  Muslim  Council  of  Britain,  said  he  hoped  the  confer-  ence  would  demonstrate  that  “99.9   per  cent  of  Muslims,  along  with  99.9  per  cent  of  Jews”  favoured  peaceful  co-existence.   The  organisers  said  they  are  seeking  to  “create  dialogue  and  an  enduring  partnership  between  Islam  and  Judaism”.   The  conference  has  been  organ-  ised  by  Alain  Michel,  founder  and  president  of  the  Paris-based  peace  foundation,  Hommes  de  Parole  (Men  of  Their  Word).   “A  lot  of  imams  and  rabbis  never   get  the  chance  to  meet  and  work   with  each  other,  though  there  are  many  initiatives  between  Islam  and  Christianity,  and  Judaism  and  Christianity,”  said  Michel.   The  chief  rabbis  of  Austria,  Brussels,  Bulgaria  and  Denmark  are  among  Jewish  religious  leaders  tak-  ing  part,  while  a  strong  contingent  from  Israel  includes  the  chief  rabbi  of  Haifa  and  prominent  members  of  the  rabbinical  court  of  Jerusalem.

"  JEWS  QUESTION  VISIT  OF  CONTROVERSIAL  SCHOLAR   MICHAEL  CAVANAGH   JEWISH  groups  are  likely  to  pur-  sue  the  Federal  Government  after  a  controversial  Islamic  scholar  was  allowed  to  enter  Australia  despite  being  denied  a  visa  to  enter  the  US  on  security  grounds.   Prominent  Jewish  figures  are  concerned  about  Swiss-based  scholar  Tariq  Ramadan,  42,  who  was  in  Australia  this  week  to  give  a  series  of  lectures,  even  though  his  visa  allowing  him  to  work  in  the  US  was  revoked  by  the  Depart-  ment  of  Homeland  Security.   Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  executive  director   Dr  Colin  Rubenstein  said  he  hoped  the  Australian  authorities   were  aware  of  Ramadan’s  back-  ground.   “One  would  hope  the  authori-  ties  were  on  top  of  this  and  knew  about  his  visit  and  his  true  per-  sona.  One  still  needs  to  ask  the   question  in  view  of  the  fact  that  his  case  is  quite  well  known.”   This  is  a  view  backed  by  Exec-  utive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Grahame  Leonard,  who  said  that  despite  Ramadan  being  on  record  as  wanting  Israel  wiped  from  the  face  of  the  earth,  he  had  gone  undetected  by  “radar”  of   Australian  authorities.   “The  community’s  stand  is  that  he  is  someone  who  needs  to  be  monitored.  He  is  someone  we  are  concerned  about,”  Leonard  said.   Ramadan,  who  has  been  accused  of  being  antisemitic,  is  the  grandson  of  Hasan  al-Banna,   the  founder  of  the  Muslim  Broth-  erhood,  which  was  established  in  Egypt  in  1928.   Muslim  Brotherhood  militants   were  responsible  for  numerous  terror  attacks  in  Egypt,  the  most  deadly  of  which  took  place  on   November  1997  in  the  resort  of  Luxor,  where  58  tourists  and  four  Egyptians  lost  their  lives.   Ramadan’s  father,  who  is  reported  to  have  fled  Egypt  fol-  lowing  a  crackdown  on  the  Broth-  erhood  in  1954,  settled  two  years  later  in  Geneva  where  Ramadan  was  born  in  1962.   The  Swiss  national,  who  is  the  author  of  more  than  20  books,  was  unable  to  take  up  a  position  at  the  prestigious  Notre  Dame  Uni-  versity  last  year,  after  US  authori-  ties  revoked  his  visa  -  reportedly  for  reasons  related  to  terrorism.

"  Disengagement  s  dividend   IN  order  to  evaluate  the  significance  of  the  historic  meeting  held  last  week   in  Istanbul  between  the  foreign  ministers  of  Israel  and  Pakistan,  one  need  look  no  further  than  the  horrified  reaction  in  Teheran.  Iranian  leaders,  according  to  press  reports,  “choked”  upon  hearing  the  news,  and  Iran’s  chief  nuclear  negotiator,  Ali  Larijani,  promptly  cancelled  a  scheduled  visit  to   Islamabad.   Israel  and  Pakistan  have  maintained  clandestine  contacts  throughout  the  years,  but  successive  Pakistani  regimes  have  preferred  to  publicly  stay  at  the  forefront  of  Islamic  opposition  to  the  “Zionist  entity”.  Thus,  President  Pervez  Musharraf’s  green  light  for  the  Istanbul  meeting  signals  that  times  are  changing.   There  are  a  host  of  possible  reasons  for  the  extraordinary  meeting,  all  inex  orably  linked  to  the  intricate  rivalries  of  the  Indian  sub-continent.  Israel’s  burgeoning  trade  links  with  India,  especially  the  reported  $2  billion  in  mili  tary  sales,  have  long  been  a  source  of  concern  for  Pakistan.  More  significant,  perhaps,  in  light  of  the  groundbreaking  address  that  Musharraf  is  scheduled  to  deliver  this  month  before  a  forum  of  the  American  Jewish  Congress  in  New  York,  is  Pakistan’s  apparent  belief  that  Israel  and  its  American  Jewish  lobby  are  vital  for  improving  relations  with  President  George  W  Bush’s  administration.   The  disengagement  from  Gaza  is  merely  a  pretext  for  Pakistan  to  promote  its  own  self-interests,  but  in  international  diplomacy,  appearances  are  every  thing.  The  Gaza  withdrawal  was  carried  out  to  enhance  Israel’s  own  security  interests  -  but  it  is  nonetheless  beginning  to  yield  important  diplomatic  div  idends  around  the  Arab  and  Muslim  world.  Thus,  the  upcoming  UN  Gener  al  Assembly  may  witness  another  historic  meeting,  between  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  and  Indonesian  President  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono.  Such  a  meeting  would  mark  a  turning  point  away  from  the  negative  fallout  of  the  four-year  Palestinian  intifada,  which  was  felt  most  in  those  Muslim  countries  that  are  farthest  removed  from  the  conflict  itself.   Given  Australia’s  wish  for  a  more-peaceful  and  stable  neighbourhood,  especially  in  Indonesia,  Canberra  should  more  than  welcome  the  warming  of  ties  with  Israel  and  the  possible  reduction  of  anti-Israeli  and  anti-western  rhetoric  in  this  region.  From  this  point  of  view,  it  seems,  the  withdrawal  from  Gaza  was  good  for  Australia  as  well. ",2005-09-09
"  Growing  up  Jewish  in  Iran   BOOK  REVIEW   MICHELLE  STEIN-EVERS   JOURNEY  FROM  THE  LAND  OF  NO:  A  GIRLHOOD  CAUGHT  IN  REVOLUTIONARY  IRAN  Roya  Hakakian   Bantam  Books,  $24   WHAT  feels  like  an  age  ago,  the  Iran  ian  Islamic  revolution  heralded  in  the  current  trend  of  Islamic  regimes,  each  trying  more  perfectly  than  any  earth  ly  regime  before  to  adhere  to  the  revealed  word  of  Allah  through   Mohammed.   In  most  of  these  regimes,  there  is  no  place  for  lews,  yet  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran  maintains  that  it   wants  to  continue  to  be  the  home   of  the  Diaspora’s  oldest  lewish  *  community.   In  Roya  Hakakian’s  poignant  and  wistfully  powerful  memoir  of  grow  ing  up  Jewish  in  the  midst  of  the  Iran  ian  Revolution,  we  see  repeatedly  the  tensions  created  when  an  ancient   community  is  caught  on  the  horns  of   a  modern  dilemma.   Hakakian’s  memoir  began  in  America  where,  as  a  CNN  producer,  she  tried  to  explain  to  another  jour  nalist  the  complicated  nature  of  the   v‘-  Iranian  revolution.   It  is  not  enough  to  dismiss  what  happened  in  Iran  as  the  product  of  Muslim  fundamentalists  -  something  much  more  culturally  profound  hap  pened  there.   The  hows  and  whys  of  its  hijacking  by  what  are  now  termed  fundamen  talists  are  usually  glossed  over,  in  „  favour  of  the  more  snappy  journalistic   jargon.   Hakakian’s  memoir  shows  us  that  the  revolution  began  as  an  Iranian  movement  which  later,  after  much  resistance  by  many  people,  descended   into  an  Islamic  one.   r  Hakakian’s  story  is  a  love  letter  to   Iran,  her  Jewish  family  and  her  Mus  lim  neighbours.  It  is  filled  with  long  ing  and  memory  and  affection,  even  as  she  takes  us  through  the  events  which  would  ultimately  sunder  her  from  her  family,  homeland  and   culture.   Her  window  onto  the  events  of  the  revolution  -  her  childhood  home  -  was  across  the  street  from  what  was  the  Pahlavi  Foundation,  which  later  became  the  Mostazeffan  Foundation   (the  Dispossessed),  now  accused  of  being  one  of  the  leading  financial   backers  of  international  Islamic   terror.   We  see  repeatedly  the  tensions  created  when  an  ancient  community  is  caught  on  the  horns  of  a  modern  dilemma.   From  her  roof  Hakakian  watched  as  the  revolution  came  closer  and  closer,  later  invading  even  her  Jewish  girls’  school.   The  anecdotes  in  Journey  from  the  Land  of  No  tell  of  how  Hakakian  and   her  schoolmates  resisted  the  Muslim  woman  appointed  head  of  their  school  -  she  explains  that  her  genera  tion  had  learned  to  fight  authority,  even  as  that  newly-placed  authority  felt  it  no  problem  to  use  violence  against  them.   The  rebellious  nature  of  adoles  cence,  coupled  with  the  lessons  of  a  revolutionary  time,  would  lead  to  the  Passover  Rebellion  of  1979  but  also  to  her  family’s  decision  to  finally  flee  and  join  their  sons  in  the  US.   Hakakian  also  reveals  her  Jewish  family’s  fractious  response  to  the  rev  olution:  some  members  immediately  sensing  danger  and  leaving,  others,  such  as  her  father,  placing  their  faith  that  the  steadiness  of  the  past  could  be  resumed  in  the  near  future.   Non-Iranian  Jews  who  have  expe  rienced  the  Holocaust  cannot  under  stand  the  emotional  attachment  Persian  Jews  have  for  their  homeland  and  the  utter  resistance  so  many  of  them  had  to  leaving  Iran.   It  was  hard  for  Jews  to  decide  to  leave:  the  Persian  Jewish  community  has  been  in  existence  since  the  time  of  Tilgath-Pileser,  727  BCE.  This  makes  it  undoubtedly  the  oldest  Diaspora  community.   There  have  been  Jews  in  Iran  before  there  were  Persians  and  long  before  there  were  Muslims.   And  even  today,  surprisingly  to  some,  25  years  after  the  revolution,  there  is  still  a  strong  Jewish  commu  nity  in  Iran  with  more  than  30,000   members.   Hakakian’s  exquisite  memoir  explains  this  complicated  relation  ship.  There  is  more  affection  and,  I  feel,  more  truth  in  this  book  than  in  other  more  sensational  Iran  memoirs  such  as  Betty  Mahmoody’s  Not  With  out  My  Daughter.

"  Jewish  temple  hosts   historic  inter-faith  service   ANGIE  FOX   IN  a  historic  first,  the  Order  of  Australia  Association  National  Conference  concluded  with  an  inter  faith  service  held  in  a'  shul  as  opposed   to  a  church.   Last  Sunday  s  service,  conducted  at  Melbourne’s  Temple  Beth  Israel  (TBI),  was  led  by  TBI’s  senior  rabbi,  Fred  Morgan,  and  recognised  the  enor  mous  contribution  to  Australia  by  members  of  the  association.   More  than  500  guests  -  many  who  had  never  before  entered  a  synagogue  -  attended  the  service.  Among  those  present  were  Governor-General  Major-General  Michael  Jefferey  and  former  governor-general  Sir  Zelman   Cowen.   TBI’s  rabbi  emeritus,  John  Levi,  who  welcomed  guests  to  the  event,  told  the  AJN  it  was  a  “tribute  to  Aus  tralian  democracy”  that  an  inter-faith  service  could  be  held  in  a  shul.   “There  are  very  few  countries  where  the  highest  honours  can  be  cel  ebrated  in  a  synagogue,”  he  said.   He  said  it  was  an  honour  to  have  TBI  congregant  Sir  Zelman  at  the  serv  ice.

"  Israeli  dashes  wrestler’s  medal  dream   BRONZEMEDALS   SAMANTHA  BADEN   TEL  AVIV  -  Australian  74-kilogram  freestyle  wrestling  champion  David  Zemlinsky  picked  up  a  bronze  medal  at  the  Maccabiah  Games,  but  it  could  have  been  so  much  more.   Unluckily  for  the  Australian  num  ber  one,  who  finished  second  in  his  group  after  the  preliminary  rounds,  he  ran  into  one  of  the  top  Israelis,  Artor  Micheli,  and  went  down  by  a  solitary  point  to  dash  his  hopes  of  a  gold  medal.   “It  was  pretty  close.  I  thought  I   could  have  done  a  lot  better  but  unfortunately  time  was  up,”  Zemlin  sky,  28,  said.   Lev  Khaziner  on  the  mat  in  the  96   kilogram  division...  he  won  a  bronze   medal.  Photo:  Peter  Haskin   “But  I  was  pretty  happy  with  the  result  and  the  whole  experience  of  the  Maccabiah  was  fantastic.  Regardless   of  the  outcome  of  the  wrestle  we  shook  hands  and  walked  away  good  friends  -  that’s  the  most  amazing  experience  you  can  get.”   Zemlisky  beat  Russian  Ilya  Shafran   in  the  consolation  final  to  claim  the  bronze  medal.   Fellow  wrestler  Lev  Khaziner,  in  the  96-kg  division,  also  won  a  bronze  medal  for  Australia.  Khaziner,  23,  was  put  out  of  gold-medal  contention  by  two-time  world  champion  Sergey  Yankovsky  from  Russia  in  one  of  the  quickest  matches  on  the  mat.   But  he  still  walked  away  with  third  place  after  winning  the  play-off.   As  part  of  their  Maccabiah  Games  preparations,  both  wrestlers  trained  in  Lithuania  in  the  month  leading  up   to  the  event.   A  few  weeks  before  leaving  Aus  tralia,  Zemlinsky  came  second  in  the  national  championships,  beating  the  current  Australian  champion  along  the  way.   Bom  in  Azerbaijan  in  the  former  Soviet  Union  -  a  predominantly  Muslim  country  -  Zemlinsky  grew  up   as  “an  outsider”  and  learnt  from  an  early  age  to  stand  up  for  himself.   “It  was  pretty  different.  Being  Jew  ish  in  a  Muslim  country,  you  had  to  be  tough.  That  was  one  of  the  reasons  why  I  took  up  wrestling,”  he  said.   “Wrestling  gave  me  a  lot  of  confi   dence  on  the  street  and  in  life.”   Both  wrestlers  are  based  in  Mel   bourne  and  train  under  Grigory   Khaziner  in  Moorabbin.

"  Golden  age  of  Jews  is  ‘over’,  second  Holocaust  ‘possible’   STAFF  REPORTER   THE  golden  age  of  Diaspora  Jewry  is  over  and  a  “second  Holocaust”  could  be  around  the  comer,  US  academic  Dr  Daniel  Pipes  warned  this  week.   Addressing  the  two-day  conference  on  “Antisemitism  in  the  Contempo  rary  World”  at  Monash  University,  Dr  Pipes,  a  leading  analyst  on  Islam,   warned  of  an  Iranian  nuclear  attack  on  Israel  which  could  claim  as  many  Jew  ish  lives  as  World  War  II.   “Muslims  are  now  the  main  spon  sors  of  antisemitism  in  the  West,”  Dr  Pipes  said.  “This  could  lay  the  founda  tions  for  a  second  Holocaust”   Dr  Pipes  is  director  of  the  Middle  East  Forum,  an  independent  think  tank  that  promotes  US  interests  in  the   Middle  East  Once  dismissed  as  an  alarmist,  Dr  Pipes’  predictions  about  the  rise  of  militant  Islamism  were  finally  given  currency  after  9/11.   During  his  address,  Dr  Pipes  also  delivered  a  bleak  forecast  for  European  Jewry.  “European  Jewry’s  future  is  in  doubt  Jews  who  survived  the  Holo  caust  must  again  fear  for  the  future.   “The  Muslim  world  is  now  the  main  source  for  antisemitism.  This  represents  a  sea  change,  an  enormous  historical  shift...  The  Christian  world  has  increasingly  come  to  terms  with  its   Dr  Dai   “Muslll  the  m  antise  West   thefou   second   Pipes:   are  now   i  sponsors  I  ism  in  the!   cqujdlay-j   T,*t   &amp;A&amp;:   relationship  towards  the  Jews”   Organised  by  Monash  University’s  Australian  Centre  for  the  Study  of  Jew  ish  Civilisation,  the  conference  marked  the  first  major  antisemitism  talkfest  in   Australia  since  1984.   At  a  community  forum  on  Sunday  evening,  Dr  Pipes  extended  his  predic   tions  to  the  United  States.   “[The  golden  age  of  American  Jewry]  is  coming  to  a  close  and  the  Jewish  community  in  the  United  States  has  its  own  set  of  problems.   “What  is  particular  now  ...  is  the  process  of  attempting  to  dehumanise  Jews  ...  Antisemitism  in  the  1950s  did  not  include  this  kind  of  ideology.”   In  response  to  Dr  Pipes,  Pro  fessor  Dina  Porat,  head  of  the  Stephen   Roth  Institute   for  the  Study  of  Contemporary  Antisemitism  and  Racism  at  Tel  Aviv  Univer   sity,  urged  the  controversial  commentator  to   exercise  “pro  portion”  in  his   doom-and   gloom  predictions.  Moderate  Islam  is  on  the  rise,  she  said.  “The  vast  Muslim  world  contains  a  variety  of  opinions,  it  is  tom  by  inner  strife,  suffers  techno  logical  and  economic  inferiority  and  is  quite  far  from  the  monolithic  dogma  of  the  Nazi  ideology.”   She  also  said  that  while  anti  semitism  is  indeed  increasing  and  spreading  to  “western  democracies”,  the  world  is  far  better  equipped  to  respond.

"  Holocaust  no  parallel  to   mandatory  detention:  rabbi   MELISSA  SINGER   THE  Holocaust  has  no  parallel,  and  comparing  it  to  the  plight  of  refugees  and  Aborigines  is  disingenuous,  a  sen   ior  rabbi  said  this  week.   Australian  John  Levi,  rabbi  emeri  tus  of  Melbourne’s  Temple  Beth  Israel,  said  the  invocation  of  the  Holocaust  in  Jewish  discussions  about  the  Federal  Government’s  mandatory  detention  policy  and  Aboriginal  reconciliation  may  lead  to  a  communal  misunder  standing  of  the  issues.   “I  just  don’t  see  the  parallel,”  Rabbi  Levi  told  the  AJN.  “Nobody  is  locking  up  Aborigines  and  putting  them  in  gas   chambers.   “The  Holocaust  becomes  counter   feit  if  we  talk  about  it  all  the  time.  It   was  a  horror  with  no  parallel.  [But]  I  hope  the  Jewish  attitude  will  prevail  that  it’s  wrong  to  lock  up  children.”   Rabbi  Levi  was  speaking  to  the  AJN  following  the  conclusion  of  the  fourth  Abraham  inter-faith  conference,  which  was  attended  by  around  150  people,  including  about  50  Jews,  at  the  University  of  Sydney  last  weekend.  The  Melbourne  leg  of  the  conference  was  held  on  May  28-29.   Sharing  a  platform  with  Sydney’s  Catholic  Archbishop,  Cardinal  George  Pell,  and  Melbourne  Muslim  leader  Sheikh  Fehmi  Naji  el-Imam,  Rabbi  Levi  used  his  address  to  condemn  reli   gious  fanaticism  in  light  of  last  week’s  bombing  of  a  marketplace  in   Sulawesi,  Indonesia,  and  Jewish  oppo  sition  to  the  forthcoming  disengage   ment  from  Gaza.   “To  my  dismay,  in  their  fanaticism  they  distort  the  very  symbols  that  Jews  hold  precious  -  the  Hebrew  Bible,  the  vision  of  God’s  kingdom  and  the  prophetic  vision  of  a  caring  and  right  eous  society,”  said  Rabbi  Levi,  who  is  also  deputy  president  of  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry.   Cardinal  Pell  told  the  conference  that  the  three  faiths  must  ensure  that   their  “friendship  is  not  strangled  by  those  worshipping  the  idols  of  vio   lence”.   “None  of  us  should  have  any  inter  est  in  seeing  historic  enmities  are  imported  to  Australia.  It  is  often  to  escape  these  conflicts  ...  that  migrants  continue  to  come  to  our  country.”   Sheikh  Fehmi  said  the  faiths  must   work  together  to  reject  the  stereotyp  ing  of  Muslims  as  extremists.   Rabbi  Levi  told  the  AJNthat  Cardi  nal  Pell,  while  ""doctrinaire”,  was  “very   broadminded  in  non-Christian  mat  ters”.  He  also  commended  Sheikh  Fehmi’s  moderateness  and  comment   ed  that  “the  Muslim  community  is  more  moderate  and  less  hostile  [in  Melbourne]  than  in  Sydney”.

In  his  address,  Leonard  con  tended  that  Australia's  multicultur  al  vision  is  “far  from  fully  accepted  by  all  Australians”.   “For  many  it  is  dismissed  as  an  ethnic  issue  and  is  a  useful  means  of  effective  assimilation,”  Leonard  told  the  conference.   “Only  by  the  singular  pursuit  of  Australia's  unique  model  of  multi  culturalism  will  we  achieve  the  peace  and  harmony  to  which  all  Australians  are  entitled.  We  as  leaders  of  Australia’s  Abrahamic  religions...  have  a  special  respon  sibility  to  help  bring  this  about”   Speaking  to  the  AJN  this  week,  Leonard  said  the  conference  aimed  to  strengthen  dialogue  between  the  Jewish,  Christian  and  Muslim  communities,  but  added  that  forging  practical  outcomes  was  a  ""long-term  proposition”.   “These  things  don’t.happen  in  one  magical  moment”  Leonard   said.

"  I  Jewish  words  that  kill   Jewish  terrorism  can  no  longer  be  considered  a  passing  phenonmenon.   ISRAELI  1  DOWN  UNDER'   CHEMI  SHALEV   A   Jewish  terrorism  stems  from  the  cesspool  of  extremist,   fundamentalist,  right  wing  ideology.   READERS  of  the  Melbourne   edition  of  the  Australian   Jewish  News  got  a  relative  ly-mild  sample  last  week  of   the  kind  of  rampant  rhetoric  used  in  recent  months  by  opponents  of  the  Gaza  pullout.  In  a  full-page  advertisement  in  this  newspaper,  35  rabbis,  mostly  from  Chabad,  described  the  disengagement  as  “suicidal  surrender”.  It  is  “forbid  den”,  the  rabbis  pronounced,  for  anyone  to  participate  in  the  with  drawal,  or  even  to  endorse  it.   No,  the  advertisement  did  not  call  for  violence,  neither  did  it  preach  terror;  nor  did  any  of  the  rabbis,  settler  leaders  or  pullout  opponents  in  Israel  who,  in  recent   weeks,  have  described  Ariel  Sharon  as  a  monstrous  fascist,  IDF  soldiers  as  “storm-troopers”,  the  official  Israeli  government  policy  as  “ethnic  cleansing”  and  the  disengagement   itself  as  “the  road  to  extinction”.   But  what  is  the  19-year-old,  highly-impressionable  and  perhaps  slightly-unbalanced  mind  of  some  one  like  Eden  Natan-Zadah  to  do   with  this  harsh  portrayal  of  reality?  Jews  are,  after  all,  sworn  to  the  oath  of  “never  again”  being  led  like  “lambs  to  the  slaughter”.  If  Israel  is  on  a  certain  path  to  “suicidal  sur  render”,  as  the  rabbis  maintain,  and  no-one  is  doing  anything  about  it,  it  takes  only  a  small  leap  of  faith  to  reach  the  conclusion  that  any  act  -  even  the  slaughter  of  innocent  Israeli  citizens  in  the  peaceful  city  of  Shfar’am  -  is  legitimate,  perhaps   even  a  mitzvah.   This  is  the  warped  and  twisted  corner  that  fundamentalist  Jewish  rabbis  and  extremist  settler  leaders   have  painted  their  gullible  support   ers  into.  And  while  there  is  a  uni  verse  of  difference  between  Muslim  terror  and  Jewish  terror,  one  cannot  but  draw  comparisons  with  the  inflammatory  rantings  and  ravings   of  radical  Muslim  sheikhs  -  of  which  there  is  a  fair  share  Down   Under  -  who  praise  martyrdom  and  suicide  bombings  in  the  just  strug  gle  against  the  “Great  Satan”  Amer   ica  and  its  underlings.   In  fact,  while  the  term  “Jewish  terrorist”  thankfully  still  takes  one  by  surprise  -  it  is  not  as  oxymoron  ic  as  one  would  hope.  From  the  killing  of  Peace  Now  demonstrator  Emil  Grunzweig  in  1983,  through  the  Jewish  underground  and  its  murderous  rampage  in  the  Islamic  College  in  Hebron,  also  in  1983,  Baruch  Goldstein  and  the  Hebron  massacre  in  1994,  the  Bat  Ay  in  underground  in  2002  and  other  assorted  “Jewish  terror”  incidents  that  have  taken  place  in  the  past  two  decades,  it  is  clear  that  Jewish  ter  rorism,  while  still  rare,  is  not  a  pass  ing  phenomenon.  And  it  stems  from  the  same  cesspool  of  extrem  ist,  fundamentalist,  right-wing  ideology  from  which  both  Natan   Zadah  and  the  assassin  of  Yitzhak   Rabin,  Yigal  Amir,  drew  their  inspi   ration.   In  fact,  the  same  kind  of  poi  soned  atmosphere  and  incendiary   incitement  that  led  to  the  traumatic   killing  of  Rabin  a  decade  ago  has   been  resurrected  in  recent  weeks  as  the  disengagement  draws  near.  And  just  like  then,  the  perpetrators  accept  no  responsibility  for  the   actions  of  those  who  take  their   words  too  seriously  and  translate   them  into  action.   The  only  consolation  is  that  Natan-Zadah  -  like  many  Muslim  terrorists  before  him  -  has  probably  achieved  the  exact  opposite  of  what  he  intended.  By  his  actions,  he  has  fortified  the  resolve  of  most  Israelis  to  carry  out  the  disengagement  and  to  overcome  the  seditious  attempts  by  settler  leaders  to  undermine  it  by   force.   For  unlike  his  terrorist  predeces  sors,  Natan-Zadah  didn’t  kill  hostile   Palestinians,  but  full-fledged  and  usually  loyal  and  peaceful  Israeli  cit  izens.  The  outpouring  of  rage  at  his   act,  from  Prime  Minister  Ariel   Sharon  downwards,  has  been  gen  uine  and  heartfelt.  His  Arab  victims,  Muslims  and  Christians,  are  being  accorded  the  same  respect  and  sym  pathy  hitherto  reserved  for  Jewish   victims  of  terror.  And  while  the   lynching  of  Natan-Zadah  inside  the  bus  in  Shfar’am  has  cast  the  Arabs  in  a  negative  light,  their  overall  restraint  in  the  difficult  aftermath   of  the  terror  attack  has  been  duly  noted  by  the  Jewish  majority.  It  may  bridge  at  least  some  of  the  chasm  that  has  existed  between  the  two  communities  since  the  Arab  riots  at  the  start  of  the  second  intifada  and   the  consequent  killing  by  police  of   13  Arab  demonstrators.   So  perhaps,  as  Samson  said  in   the  book  of  Judges,  “meaz  yaza  '  matok”,  from  this  bitter  pill  some  thing  sweet  has  emerged,  and  per  haps  the  Shfar’am  murders  are  a  blessing  in  tragic  disguise.  This  would  be  comforting,  were  it  not   for  the  certainty  that  there  are  other  *  potential  Natan-Zadahs  out  there,  and  that  the  rabble-rousers,  rab  binical  and  otherwise,  are  far  from  recognising  the  errors  of  their  ways   and  words.

"  MEDIA  SNUBBING  ISRAEL   ISRAEL  has  top  expertise  in  DNA  and  other  testing  facilities  to  help  those  countries  affected  by  the  tsuna-   mi.   Israel  has  some  of  the  best  experts  in  the  world  when  it  comes  to  disas-  ters.  Israel  offered  to  send  medical   supplies,  doctors,  field  hospitals  and  food  to  Indonesia,  Sri  Lanka  and  India  but,  just  like  what  happened  with  the  Iranian  earthquake,  some  of  these  countries  declined  Israel’s  offer  of  help.   What  is  even  more  disturbing  is   the  mainstream  media  refuse  to  inform  the  world  that  Israel  is  want-   ing  to  help  those  countries,  including   its  Muslim  citizens.   The  worldwide  media  has  enough  journalists  in  Israel  and  the  Middle  East  to  cover  the  never-ending  nega-   tive  stories  about  Israel  but  has  so  far   ignored  Israel’s  humanitarian  efforts.

"  INNOCENTS  PUNISHED   WHATEVER  Rabbi  Yoram  Ulman  and  other  rabbonim  who  believe  that  the  tsunami  was  “God’s  will”  (AJN  7/1)  want  to  say  behind  closed  doors  to  their  followers,  I  respect  their  right   to  do  so.   It  is  another  thing  altogether  to  tell  the  world,  and  especially  the  Muslim  relatives  of  the  victims  of  the  tsunami,  that  the  deaths  of  their  loved  ones  was   caused  by  the  will  of  the  Jewish  God.   The  sheer  arrogance  of  a  represen-  tative  of  God’s  chosen  people  telling  one  of  the  unchosen  people  that  God  has  willed  their  death  is  breathtaking.  The  logic  that  they  must  have  done  something  wrong  is  implied.  Those   who  are  innocent  should  not  be  told   that  they  are  being  punished  accord-  ing  to  God’s  will  unless  they  actually  believe  this  paradigm.  It  is  an  insult  to  most  Jews’  intelligence.  Telling  inno-  cent  people  that  they  have  committed  a  crime  worthy  of  punishment  is   lashon  hara.

"  World   Leaflet  heralds  al-Qaeda  presence  in  Gaza  Strip   KHALED  ABU  TOAMEH   JERUSALEM  -  Has  al-Qaeda  started  operating  in  the  Gaza  Strip?  A  leaflet  distributed  in  Khan  Yunis  last  weekend  by  al-Qaeda’s  “Palestine  branch”  announced  that   the  terrorist  group  has  begun  working  towards  uniting  the  Mus   lims  under  one  Islamic  state.   “The  Muslim  nation  has  been   subjected,  through  various  periods,  to  conspiracies  by  the  infidels,”  the  leaflet  said.  “[The  infidels]  have  brought  down  the  Islamic  Caliphate,  dividing  the  nation  into  small  and  weak  states.  They  also  managed  to  dilute  the  Islamic  character  of  the  nation.”   The  leaflet  said  unity  was  the  only  way  for  Muslims  to  achieve  victory  over  their  enemies,  adding  that  the  terrorist  group’s  chief  god   was  to  enforce  Islamic  law  in  the  entire  world.   “Our  efforts  are  now  focused  on  establishing  a  strong  and  unified  Muslim  nation  where  love  prevails  among  all  its  members,”  it  added.   The  leaflet,  signed  by  al-Qaeda  of  Jihad  in  Palestine,  is  the  latest  indication  of  al-Qaeda’s  effort  to  establish  itself  in  the  Gaza  Strip   after  the  Israeli  withdrawal  from  the   area.   On  the  eve  of  disengagement,  a   number  of  rockets  were  fired  at  the  former  settlements  of  Neveh  Dekalim  and  Ganei  Tal.  An   announcement  claiming  responsi  bility  on  behalf  of  al-Qaeda  mem  bers  in  the  Gaza  Strip  was  made  by  three  masked  gunmen  who  appeared  in  a  videotape.   “We  stress  that  this  attack  comes   in  the  context  of  the  Islamic  jihad  launched  by  our  comrades  in  al  Qaeda,”  the  masked  men  said  in  the  statement.  They  also  vowed  to  step  up  their  attacks  on  Israel.   Palestinians  reacted  with  mixed   feelings  to  reports  that  al-Qaeda  had  begun  operating  in  the  Gaza  Strip.   According  to  Nizar,  a  resident  of   Gaza  City,  some  areas  in  the  south  ern  Gaza  Strip  are  already  begin  ning  to  resemble  Afghanistan  when  it  was  ruled  by  the  Taliban.  “This  is  very  disturbing,”  he  remarked.  “You   see  more  and  more  women  cover   ing  their  faces  and  in  the  mosques  you  hear  extremely  radical  ser  mons.  The  people  there  are  behav  ing  as  if  they  were  members  of  a  tribe  in  Afghanistan.”   “You  see  more  and   more  women  covering  their  faces  and  in  the  mosques  you  hear  extremely  radical   sermons.  The  people  there  are  behaving  as  if  they  were  members  of  a  tribe  in   Afghanistan”   N1ZAR   Resident,  Gaza  City   A  Palestinian  security  official  in  the  Gaza  Strip  told  the  Jerusalem  Post  that  the  al-Qaeda  members  were  actually  Hamas  activists  oper  ating  under  the  name  of  Osama  bin  Laden’s  organisation.  “They  are  serving  the  interests  of  the  Israeli  right,  which  has  predicted  that  al  Qaeda  would  start  operating  in  the  Gaza  Strip  after  the  disengage  ment,”  he  said.   However,  some  Palestinians  wel  comed  the  news  about  al-Qaeda’s  presence  in  Gaza.  “This  is  good  news  and  we  welcome  al-Qaeda  in  Palestine  -  from  the  sea  to  the  river,”  said  a  Khan  Yunis  resident  named  Ayman.   Last  week  al-Qaeda’s  new  online  television  channel  branded  PA  President  Mahmoud  Abbas  a  “col   laborator  with  the  Jews”,  accusing  him  of  assisting  Israel  in  its  war  on   Hamas.

"  Net  faith:  inter-faith  pioneer   seeks  to  heal  religious  wounds   PETER  KOHN   AN  internet-based  “trialogue”  between  leaders  of  Judaism,  Islam  and  Christianity  could  prove  a  valuable  tool  in  breaking  down  barriers,  according  to  a  visiting  American  aca   demic.   Dr  Solomon  Schimmel,  who  has  been  a  scholar-in-residence  at  the  Uni   versity  of  Sydney’s  Shalom  Institute,  has  foreshadowed  the  program,  which  will  combine  global  inter-faith  educa  tion  and  dialogue  on  the  internet.   The  professor  of  Jewish  education  at  Hebrew  College  in  Boston,  who  lec  tured  at  this  year’s  Limmud  Oz  in  Syd  ney,  will  seek  funding  for  the  initiative   when  he  returns  to  the  United  States   shortly.   Dr  Schimmel,  a  specialist  in  using  technology  for  distance  learning,  envisages  that  the  program  will  include  scholars,  conflict-resolution  experts  and  psychologists  discussing  ways  of  opening  new  communication  lines  between  moderates  of  all  three  faiths.   In  an  address  hosted  by  the  B’nai   B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commission  in  Melbourne  last  week,  he  outlined  how  religious  values  of  all  three  faiths   “can  be  used  as  vehicles  for  peace   4   rather  than  for  violence  and  war”.   Speaking  to  the  AJN  before  his  departure  from  Australia,  Dr  Schim   mel  said:  “A  lot  of  mistrust  stems  from   religious  principles  learned  out  of  con  text,  whether  this  is  from  the  New  Tes  tament,  the  Koran  or  Jewish  texts.”   “There  are  millions  of  Muslims  around  the  world  who  could  be  swayed  from  their   negative  views  of  Jews  and  other  religions.”   DR  SOLOMON  SCHIMMEL   Visiting  scholar   He  said  global  terrorism  needed  a  military  and  police  solution  in  the  first   instance.  “But  there  are  millions  of  Muslims  around  the  world  who  could   be  swayed  from  their  negative  views  of  Jews  and  other  religions.   “If  you  can  get  moderate  Muslim  leaders  to  explain  to  their  constituen  cies  that  terrorism  is  not  the  way  of  Islam,  you  can  make  a  lot  of  headway.”   Asked  by  the  AJN  for  his  advice  to  local  leaders  on  dealing  with  Islamic  texts  inciting  hatred  that  have  been   available  in  bookshops  -  advice  he  offered  with  the  proviso  that  he  is  a  visitor  -  Dr  Schimmel  said  local  Jewish  leaders  should  pursue  all  legal  avenues  to  remove  this  type  of  material.   “But  after  that,  you  have  to  sit  down  with  moderates  and  talk  and  then  you  have  to  present  scholars  in  the  media  to  show  that  the  origin  of  this  material   is  a  falsification  of  Islam.”   He  referred  to  Professor  Abdul  Hadi  Palazzi,  an  Italian  Muslim  com  munity  leader,  as  an  example  of  mod  eration  in  the  Islamic  world,  and  a  supporter  of  Israel,  who  was  encour  aged  by  the  concept  of  an  ongoing  web-based  forum  on  cooperation.   The  Israeli-Palestinian  conflict,  which  began  as  a  clash  of  nationalisms,  has  changed  into  a  quasi-religious  conflict,  due  mainly  to  Yasser  Arafat’s  linkage  of  Palestinian  identity  with  the  worldwide  radicalisation  of  Islam,  but  also  to  the  wave  of  religious  Zionism  that  grew  after  the  Six-Day  War,  he   said.   Dr  Schimmel  has  written  a  book,  Wounds  Not  Healed  By  Time,  a  study  in  forgiveness  and  repentance  and  how  these  might  be  achieved  in  the  Israeli  Palestinian  conflict  and  in  dialogue   with  the  Vatican.

"  Torres  News  Profile:  Balfour  Ross   Q:  How  did  you  arrive  on  Thursday  Island?  A:  After  World  War  2,  we  lived  in  Edinburgh  in  Scotland,  and  moved  to  Malaysia  when  I  was  11.1  had  a  couple  of  years  there  before  being  sent  to  boarding  school  in  Adelaide.  I  returned  to  Malaysia  and  spent  five  years  working  for  my  dad's  engineering  business  in  Malaysia;  I  then  returned  to  Adelaide;  I  worked  for  the  Government  as  a  liaison  officer  for  the  DIA;  1  came  to  T.I.  from  Adelaide  University  in  1964;  stayed  for  live  weeks  and  went  back  to  Adelaide.  June  came  to  Adelaide  in  1965  and  we  got  married  in  1966  and  that's  when  I  started  work  for  P.J.  Killoran  at  the  Department  of  Native  Affairs  in  1966  at  Yarrabah  for  a  year  and  then  three  years  in  Normanton  before  coming  to  T.I,  in  1968.   Q:  How  did  you  come  to  meet  June?  A:  I  met  June's  father  to  a  Muslim  conference  in  Adelaide  in  1963  and  he  wanted  someone  to  come  to  T.I.  to  teach  the  kids  English,  and  that's  where  I  met  June.  I  had  just  finished  an  Economics  degree  at  Adelaide  Uni.  I  drove  taxis  on  T.I.  for  June's  father  (Wahap  Bin  Tahal)  here.  June  and  I  stayed  on  T.I.  until  1972  and  we  then  spent  four  years  in  N.Z.  We  came  back  in   1977  when  June's  dad  became  sick  and  needed  help  to  run  his  taxi  and  property  businesses.  In  1980,  he  sold  us  one  of  his  houses,  the  one  in  which  we  are  living  today,  and  have  been  on  T.I.  ever  since.  Q:  What  were  your  first  impression  of  T.I.  in  1964  A:  It  was  a  third-world  place,  somewhat  similar  to  Banda  Aceh  before  the  tsunami.  With  shacks,  squatters'  camps,  no  substantial  buildings  at  all.  other  than  the  Port  Office  and  Customs  House.  No  bitumen,  only  dirt  roads.  a  wooden  hospital  with  open  wards  for  everyone;  water  supply  ran  for  six  hours  a  day  during  the  wet  season  and  only  two  hours  a  day  during  the  dry  season;  intermittent  power  from,  the  power  supply  near  the  Engineers'  Wharf;  no  road  around  the  island  only  a  dirt  track  to  Tamwoy  and  another  to  Waiben.  It  was  pretty  rough  on  cars  and  you  had  to  be  a  do-  it-yourself  mechanic.  Q:  There's  been  a  huge  change  since?  A:  It  stayed  about  the  same  until  the  1980s  when  there  was  a  real  change.  The  Commonwealth  Centre  was  the  first  substantial  building  to  be  erected  in  about  1983;  bitumen  roads  were  laid;  built  the  replacement  for  the  hospital  which  was  replaced  again  in  about  1993.1  consider  about  $100  million  was  poured  into  TI  during  the  1980s  and  1990s.  Houses  were  also  erected.  A  big  shanty  town  stretched  from  Rosehill  to  Waiben  with  shanties  and  shacks  on  the  beach  where  the  industrial  area  is  now.  The  quarry  was  the  first  industry  set  up  in  that  area.  The  shanties  were  slowly  replaced  with  housing  we  see  now.  The  population  has  changed  as  well.  There  weren't  many  Islanders  -  until  the  late  1950s  -  Islanders  were  not  allowed  to  stay  on  the  Island  under  the  Department  of  Native  Affairs  regulations.  T.I.  was  inhabited  mainly  by  Malays,  Europeans,  Chinese  and  Japanese.  The  Islanders  started  to  return  during  the  1960s  to  the  stage  now  where  they  comprise  about  three-quarters  of  the   Left;  BALFOUR  ROSS.

A:  The  single  belief  of  the  faith  is  one  God,  no  intermediaries;  no  priest;'every  believer  has  to  be  his  own  priest  and  interpreter  of  the  faith.  Our  prophet,  Muhammad,  was  an  illiterate  who  could  not  read  or  write,  but   received  the  message'from  God  directly  to  write  down  the  Qur'an.  We  believe  some  of  the  things  in  the  Bible  are  correct,  but  many  things  were  taken  down  by  man  and  were  not  correct.  For  example,  we  do  not  believe  Jesus  is  the  Son  of  God,  but  is  a  Prophet  -  the  same  as  Muhammad,  Moses,  Abraham,  Noah  and  all  the  rest.  We  believe  all  Prophets  are  equal  and  the  same.  The  key  fact  is  the  meaning  of  Islam  is  —  submission  -  from  Salaam  which  is  why  Muslims  greet  each  other  (peace  be  upon  you).  here  in  1964,  thei  ibout  20  who  call  ery  little  They  won't  convert  to  religion,  but  know  little  about  religion.

"  JEWISH,  NOT  UNIVERSAL   NORMAN  Rothfield  criticises  the  Australian  Centre  for  the  Study  of  Jew  ish  Civilisations  recent  antisemitism  conference  for  narrowness  in  not   examining  racism  in  general  (AJN  25/2).  Firstly,  Rothfield  should  recall  the  hijacked  World  Conference  Against  Racism  (Durban,  2001),   which  featured  some  of  the  vilest  anti  Jewish  invective  of  recent  times.  Clear  ly,  holding  an  anti-racism  conference  does  not  necessarily  mean  Jewish  con  cerns  will  be  addressed.   Secondly,  in  his  wish  to  be  ecu  menical,  Rothfield  states  that  anti  semites  are  equally  likely  to  throw  a  brick  through  an  Asian  shop  window,  or  damage  a  mosque.  This  cannot  be  reconciled,  however,  with  the  reality  that  much  of  the  new  antisemitism  is  Muslim  in  origin.   Finally,  would  Rothfield  be  equally  insistent  that  Aborigines,  for  example,  must  consider  broader  racist  questions  rather  than  anti-Aboriginal  activity?  His  criticism  denies  the  obvious  truth   that  while  different  communities  may  share  certain  issues,  they  also  have  unique  problems  and  needs,  and  every  right  to  manage  them  in  their  own  way.

In  fact,  I  said  not  a  word  at  the  con  ference  about  Australian  Jewry  except  by  implication  when  I  suggested  that  most  Jews  may  end  up  in  Israel  and  the  “Anglosphere”.

"  DESTRUCTIVE  PREVENTION   AUSTRALIA,  along  with  many  countries,  faces  a  terrorist  threat,  and  we  need  security  agencies  to  prevent  acts  of  terror.  People  who  commit  crimes  should  be  speedily  put  on  trial  and  jailed.   However,  the  current  round  of   “pre-emptive”  and  intimidatory   ASIO  raids  on  certain  members  of   the  Muslim  community  is  problem   atic.   While  at  a  visceral  gut  level,  such  raids  may  please  some  Jews,  they  are  a  threat  to  democratic  processes.   At  least  former  prime  minister  Malcolm  Fraser  has  denounced  these   actions  by  the  Howard  government  and  interestingly,  mentioned  con  cerns  raised  about  such  secret  state  methods  by  Israeli  officials  in  the  fight  against  terror.   In  a  democracy,  we  should  expect  a  right  to  speedy  and  open  legal  process  for  alleged  crimes,  not  totali   tarian  secret  state  methods.   The  abuse  of  such  activities  though  willing  political  interference,  overenthusiastic  surveillance,  abuse  of  evidence,  and  tipoffs  aimed  at  tabloid  exposure  is  inevitable.   Current  legislation  makes  it  a  crime  for  those  raided  to  report  that  they  have  been  subject  to  raids  and  the  whole  process  is  subject  to  gag  ging  orders.   There  is  virtually  no  right  of  redress  and  limited  judicial  oversight.   The  excuse  that  terrorists  hold  democracy  in  contempt  does  not  wash  when  people  are  not  charged  or  put  on  trial  -  people  are  innocent  until  proven  guilty.

  MUSLIM  INTEGRATION   “I  DONT  think  you  should  see  this  in  the  context  of  terrorism  -1  think  that’s  a  mistake.  If  we’d  have  had  no  terror  ism  there  would  still  have  been  an  argument  for  greater  integration.” ,2006-09-22
"  ON  MUSLIM  INTEGRATION   WOULD  it  not  have  been  better  for  the   Jewish  community,  as  well  as  supporting  the  prime  minister's  comments,  to  take  the  opportunity  to  promote  a  more  bal  anced  view  of  the  situation?  Yes  there  are  some  Arabic-speaking  people  who  do  not  appear  to  want  to  speak  English,  but  not  all  of  them  are  Muslims  -  there  are  Arab  Christians.  Surely  it  would  be  prudent  to  add  to  the  prime  minister's  comments,  which  isolate  one  group,  that  there  are  other  migrant  groups  that  refuse  to  leam  English.  We  cannot  just  use  the  threat  of  Islamic  fundamentalists  to  shape  our  immigration  policy.   MICHAEL ",2006-09-29

"  Workers  walk  through  the  site   of  the  Simon  Wiesenthal   Centre’s  Museum  of  Tolerance  being   built  in  Jerusalem.  Photo:  JTA   Muslim  graves  threaten   Wiesenthal  museum   TOMTUGEND   LOS  ANGELES  -  The  construction  of  the  $A250-million  Museum  of  Tolerance  by  the  Simon  Wiesenthal  Centre  in  Jerusalem  is  under  threat  because  the  site  chosen  for  the  museum  is  an  800-year-old  Muslim  grave  yard.   In  a  petition  to  the  Israeli  High  Court  of  Justice,  lawyers  for  two  Muslim  organisations  asserted  that  thousands  of  Muslims  who  died  during  the  Crusades  of  the  12th  and  13th  centuries  were  buried  at  the  site  where  the  centre  is  being  built   They  also  argue  that  associates  of  the  Islamic  prophet  Mohammed  were  interred  at  the  site  in  the  seventh  century.   In  response,  the  High  Court  this  week  appointed  former  Chief  Justice  MeirShamgar  as  a  mediator.  Shamgar  has  a  month  to  find  a  resolution  on  the  topic.   The  petition  comes  after  years  of  bureau  cratic  wrangling  and  vocal  opposition  from  influential  Jerusalemites,  and  only  a  few  months  after  the  road  seemed  finally  clear  last  May,  when  a  gala  ceremony  marked  the  groundbreaking  on  the  three-acre  campus.  California  Governor  Arnold  Schwarzenegger  and  the  then-mayor  of  Jerusalem,  Ehud  Olmert,  lauded  the  new  centre’s  goal  of  pro  moting  civility  and  respect  among  Jews  and  between  Jews  and  Muslims.   This  week,  Olmert  reiterated  his  support  for  the  ruling.  ‘This  is  an  essential  project  for  Jerusalem,  a  landmark  that  will  change  the  face  of  Jerusalem  forever.  I  stand  behind  it  100  per  cent”   But  in  recent  weeks,  workmen  excavating  the  site  unearthed  bones  and  partial  skele  tons  from  the  old  Muslim  Mamilla,  or  Maman  Allah,  cemetery.   There  is  agreement  that  Muslims  have  been  buried  at  the  site,  possibly  five  layers  deep,  for  many  centuries.   Wiesenthal  Centre  founder  and  director  Rabbi  Marvin  Hiertold  the  JTA  that  $A13  mil  lion  has  already  been  spent  on  the  building.  “Never  in  a  million  years  would  we  have  undertaken  this  project  if  the  government  of  Israel  or  the  Jerusalem  municipality  had  told  us  that  we  were  building  atop  a  Muslim  cemetery.  We  would  have  rejected  the  site  out  of  hand,”  he  declared.   But  Israeli  politicians  have  also  joined  the  chorus  of  objections.  Likud  Parly  member  Reuven  Rivlin,  the  speaker  of  the  Knesset,  asked:  “Why,  for  God’s  sake,  does  a  house  of  tolerance  need  to  be  built  on  a  Muslim   cemetery.  It  goes  against  logic.”  He  added:  “My  parents  are  buried  on  the  Mount  of  Olives.  If  someone  decided  they  needed  to  be  moved  to  build  a  museum  of  tolerance,  I’d   be  very  angryf'   JTA ",2006-03-03

Leonard  said  that  granting  asy  lum  to  members  of  an  organisation   that  “advocates  the  creation  of  an   Islamic  theocracy”  could  create  “sig  nificant  problems  [for]  community  harmony,  and  perhaps  to  Australian  society  itself’   The  cases  of  the  five  men,  who  are  reportedly  from  Syria,  Egypt  and  India,  appeared  before  the  Refugee   Review  Tribunal  and  the  Federal   Magistrates  Court  between  1996  and   2002.

"  Zionists  rally  behind  Howard  over  Muslim  integration   MARK  FRANKLIN   AUSTRALIAN  Zionist  leaders  have   rallied  in  support  of  the  Federal  Gov  ernment’s  calls  for  greater  Muslim  integration  in  response  to  senior  Jew  ish  figures  who  criticised  Prime  Min  ister  John  Howard  last  week  for  alienating  Muslims.   The  Zionist  Federation  of  Australia  (ZFA),  the  country’s  peak  Zionist  roof  body,  released  a  statement  saying  the  Australian  Government  “expressed  its  profound  understanding  of  the  com  plexities  of  the  worldwide  fight  against  terrorism”.   The  Australia/Israel  8c  Jewish  Affairs  Council  (AIJAC)  said  in  a  statement  that  it  is  “the  responsibility  of  everyone,  especially  political  leader  ship,  to  marginalise  and  condemn   anyone”  who  does  not  adhere  to  the  “core  values”  of  Australian  multiculturalism.   But  perhaps  the  most  outspoken   was  State  Zionist  Council  of  Victoria   president  Dr  Danny  Lamm,  who  expressed  support  “for  the  prime  minister,  as  well  as  the  treasurer  and  foreign  minister,  who  called  for  immi  grants  to  learn  English  and  accept   Australian  values”   Referring  to  last  week’s  AJN  story  which  prompted  these  public  expres  sions  of  support,  Dr  Lamm  said:  “While  the  PM’s  comments  on  this  issue  have  attracted  attention  and  even  criticism  from  some  quarters,  I  hasten  to  add  that  this  was  not  from   the  roof-body  organisations  which  have  a  mandate  to  represent  the  Jew  ish  community  -  despite  the  A/N’s   front-page  headline  last  week.”   But  B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commission  chairman  Dr  Paul  Gard  ner  -  who  last  week  criticised  Prime   Minister  John  Howard  for  singling  out  a  “small  portion”  of  the  Islamic  community  when  other  immigrant  groups  were  equally  reluctant  to  inte  grate  -  stuck  to  his  guns.   Although  he  offered  “strong  sup   port”  for  the  government’s  stance  against  terrorism,  Dr  Gardner  said:  “The  prime  minister’s  criticism  of  Muslims  was  based  on  the  premise  that  if  people  learned  English  they’d   be  less  inclined  to  commit  terrorism   and  that’s  not  right  ...

"  Kosher  Katzy’s  expands  -  to  the  Muslim  community   NICOLE  BRESKIN   KATZY’S,  the  Bondi  kosher  food  store  and  factory,  has  broadened  its  market  -  to  include  the  Muslim  community.   Katzy’s,  which  has  had  certifica   tion  from  the  NSW  Kashrut  Author   ity  (KA)  since  it  opened  four  years  ago,  is  now  also  certified  to  sell  its  products  to  observant  Muslims.   “The  Muslim  community  is  much  bigger  than  the  Jewish  com  munity  in  Sydney.  Just  do  the  math,”  said  Katzy’s  owner  Martin  Katz,  explaining  why  the  incorporation  of   halal  certification  to  meet  Islamic   culinary  requirements  will  be  good   for  business.   At  the  end  of  2005,  Katzy’s  received  halal  certification  from  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils  (AFIC).  AFIC  inspects  food  ingredients  and  processes  to  ensure  they  adhere  to  halal  require   ments.   Menekse  Yasar,  a  spokesperson  for  AFIC,  said  that  it’s  “no  problem”  for  kosher  products  to  receive  halal  certification,  as  “all  kosher  products  are  halal,  as  long   Katzy’s  owner  Martin  Katz  ...  now  trading  to  the  Muslim  community.   as  there  is  no  alcohol  inside”   She  added  that  AFIC  authorities  have  no  concern  that  the  food  has  been  prepared  by  Jews.   Katz  confirmed  that  the  halal   products  he  is  making  are  the  “exact  same  products  [as  the  kosher  items]”.  The  only  difference  is  that  the  labelling  will  state  either  kosher   or  halal.   Katzy’s  has  been  supplying  kosher-certified  products  to  super  markets  in  the  eastern  suburbs  and  on  the  north  shore  for  the  last  six  months;  it  is  now  expanding  to  supermarkets  in  the  western  sub  urbs  with  halal  products  for  the  Islamic  community.  Supermarkets  Katzy’s  currently  supplies  include  Coles,  IGA  and  Franklin’s.   Although  the  products  will  be  manufactured  in  Katzy’s  on-site  factory  and  will  be  halal,  provided  no  alcohol  has  been  added,  they  will  not  be  labelled  as  halal  for  sale   in  its  Bondi  store,  according  to   Katz.   The  KA’s  Rabbi  Moshe  Gutnick  told  the  AJN  he  had  discussed  the  issue  with  Katz  and  had  given  him  the  green  light.   “This  is  a  normal  thing,  and  a  good  thing  in  the  context  of  the  world  [conflicts  between  Muslims  and  Jews],”  Rabbi  Gutnick  said,  adding  that  the  incorporation  of  halal-certified  products  is  not  in  conflict  with  the  KA’s  policies.   He  said  that  Massel,  a  food  flavouring  manufacturer  in  Sydney  already  sells  certified  products  that   are  both  kosher  and  halal.  Massel  has  been  halal-approved  since  1984,  and  received  kosher  approval   in  2005.   Katz  said  he  hopes  to  bring  his  halal-certified  products,  currently  only  sold  in  Sydney,  to  Melbourne  and  Surfers  Paradise,  where  his  kosher  items  are  already  sold.

"  ‘Brave’  defence   in   MICHELLE  ROMAIN   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO   Vic  Alhadeff  offered  a  “brave”  defence   of  the  Jews  following  his  address  last   week  at  a  conference  about  the  media’s   coverage  of  Islam.

The  audience  of  almost  100  people  fired  most  questions  at  Alhadeff  dur  ing  a  panel  discussion  following  his  presentation,  in  which  he  showed  a  rash  of  antisemitic  cartoons  published   in  the  Islamic  media.   “Speaking  as  a  Jewish  Australian,  we  have  a  concern  that  a  great  deal  of  the  media  coverage  that  comes  out  of   the  Middle  East  lacks  context  and  lacks  balance,”  he  said.   “The  assailants  are  drawing  a  dot  ted  line,  blaming  the  Jews  living  in  Australia,  the  Australian  Jews,  for  what  is  happening  over  there.”   He  said  the  proliferation  of  anti   Zionist  and  antisemitic  material  in  the   Islamic  media  “sends  an  unambiguous  message  that  hatred  of  Jews  is  not  merely  permissible,  but  is  endorsed  and  encouraged”.   “If  you  pick  up  any  copy  of  the  Aus  tralian  Jewish  News  you  will  not  find  vilification  of  the  Muslim  people,”  Alhadeff,  a  former  AJN  editor,  said   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff...  came  under  Are  at  a   conference  hosted  by  Macquarie   University’s  Centre  for  Middle  East  and   North  African  Studies  last  week.

Writing  on  the  website  Crihey.com.au,  Irfan  Yousuf,  a  Mus  lim,  said  that  Alhadeff  made  a  “brave  presentation”  that  “opened  up  my  eyes  to  this  scourge  of  antisemitism”.   He  continued:  “Alhadeff  hardly  mentioned  Israel  or  Palestine  during  his  presentation.  That  didn’t  stop  some  people  from  asking  him  to  explain  the   actions  and  attitudes  of  Israelis.  When  I  criticise  western  media  for  their  anti   Muslim  bias,  I’d  be  insulted  if  people  turned  around  asking  me  to  explain  the  actions  of  al-Qaeda  and  the  Tal  iban.  Surely  some  supporters  of  the   Palestinian  and  Lebanese  causes  could  relate  to  this  and  not  have  treated   Alhadeff  so  shabbily.”   In  response,  Alhadeff  said  that   while  he  found  the  environment   “extremely  challenging”,  it  was  “important  to  get  our  message  out   there”.   The  other  Jewish  speaker  at  the  conference,  anti-Israel  author  Antony  Loewenstein,  told  the  audi  ence  that  Israel  is  a  “rogue  state”  engaging  in  “ethnic  cleansing”  and  described  the  Australian  Jewish  community  as  “terminally  insecure”.   “As  a  Jew  I  am  ashamed  of  my  homeland,”  he  said.

"  Danish  cartoons  ‘contemptible’,  Muslim  expert  tells  Limmud  Oz   MELISSA  SINGER   THE  publication  of  caricatures  of  the  Prophet  Mohammed  in  a  Danish  newspaper  earlier  this  year  was  a  “contemptible”  social  experiment  designed  to  test  the  tolerance  of  the  local  Islamic  population,  a  Muslim  commentator  told  a  Jewish  audience  on  Sunday.   Waleed  Aly,  spokesperson  for  the  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria,  said  the  free  speech  argument  used  by  some  to  defend  the  publication  of  the  car  toons  was  a  “convenient  way  to  justi  fy  a  contemptible  action”.   “We  [generally]  don’t  publish  things  merely  to  offend.  We  publish  things  because  it’s  important  that  things  are  said  for  some  substantive  reason,”  Aly  told  more  than  300  peo  ple  at  a  Limmud  Oz  panel  on  “The   Danish  cartoons:  whither  freedom  of  speech?”   The  annual  conference  of  Jewish  learning  is  held  every  year,  rotating  between  Sydney  and  Melbourne.

AJN  cartoonist  John  Kron  defended  artists’  freedom  to  express  their  opinion,  but  emphasised  the  need  for  some  “self-censorship”.   “If  the  only  test  of  whether  to  publish  [a  cartoon]  was  if  it  is  likely  to  cause  offence,  then  nothing  would  get  published,”  he  said.   Professor  Robert  Manne,  a  lectur   er  in  politics  at  La  Irobe  University,  objected  to  the  banning  of  material  such  as  the  Danish  cartoons,  but  warned  that  its  publication  can  pro  voke  “the  downward  spiral  of  suspi  cion  and  hate”  towards  Muslims.   “The  publication  in  the  West  of   material  known  to  be  offensive...  can   only  serve  to  make  out  present  predicament  worse,”  he  said.   aJn.com.au  Photo  gallery ",2006-06-16
"  Does  British  plus  Muslim  equal  extremist?   Book  review   LONDONISTAN  Melanie  Phillips   Encounter  Books,  $56   Reviewed  by  Joff  Lelliott   WHEN  I  put  this  book  down,  I  didn’t   so  much  feel  I  had  read  it,  than  I  had  been  beaten  around  the  head  with  it.  Londonistan  has  stirred  up  controversy  and  debate  in  Britain.  The  book’s  central  argument  is  that  Britain,  and  London  in  particular,  has  “sleepwalked”  into  being  a  centre  of  Islamic  extremism,  and  that  British  values  and  culture  are  becoming  secondary  to  those  of  Islam.  Philips  blames  multiculturalism,  liberal  attitudes  in  the  estab  lishment  and  a  policy  of  appeasing  extremism.   On  its  publication,  the  book  divided  Britain  into  passionate  camps,  with  the  stereotype  of  liberal/left  Guardian  readers  pitted  against  authoritarian  Daily  Mail  read  ers.  To  make  things  more  interesting,  Phillips  has  since  changed  sides.  For  many  years  she  was  a  Guardian  journalist,  but  her  views  have  altered  and  she  now  writes  a  populist  column  for  The  Daily  Mail  -  The  Guardian's  nemesis.  (It’s  only  fair  to  declare  that  this  reviewer  spent  30  years  in  London  with  a  copy  of  The  Guardian  tucked  under  his  arm.)   Although  primarily  about  Islamic  extrem  ism,  this  sprawling  book  takes  a  wide  sweep  and  Phillips  attacks  multiculturalism,  immi  gration,  the  asylum  system,  liberal  thinking,  the  welfare  system,  the  churches,  political  correctness,  the  establishment,  the  media,  modern  parenting,  the  European  Union,  school  curricula,  the  universities  and  inter  national  organisations.  I  was  left  wondering  who  wants  the  more  profound  changes  in  Britain:  Islamic  extremists  or  Melanie  Phillips.   There  are,  of  course,  extremists  within  Islamic  communities  and  terrorist  attacks  and  suicide  bombers  are  real,  as  is  anti  semitism  among  some  Muslims.  But  it  is  a  question  of  perspective  and  scale.   Although  she  denies  it,  Phillips  sees  almost  all  Muslims  as  fanatics  and  Islam  as  a  funda  mentally-flawed  religion  feeding  extremism.  Her  attacks  on  Islam  and  Muslims  are  almost  unremitting,  but  every  so  often  she  pauses  for  breath  and  tells  us  not  all  Muslims  are  bad,  before  continuing  the  onslaught.   Major  problems  with  the  book  stem  from  a  poor  use  of  sources.  Melanie  Phillips  takes  any  statement  by  radical  Muslims  and  simply  extrapolates,  arguing  that  it  is  representative  of  Muslim  opinion  generally.   Furthermore,  the  book  lacks  almost  any  proper  research.  Thumbing  through  the  ref  erences  we  find  Phillips  relies  overwhelm   ingly  on  newspaper  reports.  This  becomes  laughable  when  The  Sun,  the  notorious  British  tabloid,  is  cited  as  if  it  were  scholarly   and  reliable.   It  is  one  thing  to  suggest  Britain’s  teachers,  media,  churches  and  even  politicians  are  too  liberal.  But  when  she  argues  the  security  services,  police  and  judiciary  are  paralysed  by  their  liberalism  and  their  political  correct  ness,  we  begin  to  get  a  sense  of  where  Melanie  Phillips  is  coming  from.   She  tells  us  the  burga  (a  traditional  head  dress)  is  “a  political  statement  of  antagonism  towards  the  British  state”  and  the  re-printing  earlier  this  year  of  Danish  cartoons  depicting  Mohammed  as  a  terrorist  “were  an  expres  sion  of  high  moral  purpose”.   For  Melanie  Phillips,  all  elements  of  British  society  are  in  cahoots  with  Islamists  and  only  a  brave  few  will  name  the  appeasing  of  extremism  and  subjugation  of  the  British  peo  ple  for  what  it  is.   For  this  reviewer,  Britain’s  multicultural  ism  is  something  to  be  treasured,  not  deni  grated  as  “moral  inversion”.  But  that  probably  just  forms  part  of  the  liberal-left  alliance  with  Islamic  extremism  that  Melanie  Phillips  sees  everywhere.

"  A  RESPONSE  TO  MARK  BAKER   The  case  for  ‘Islamophobia’   Australia  and  its  Jews  cannot   ignore  the  threats  posed  by  a  growing  Muslim  population.   VIEWPOINT   HILARY  RUBINSTEIN   IN  his  article  deploring  Islamopho   bia,  Dr  Mark  Baker  (AJN  24/3)  dis  misses  talk  of  a  majority  Muslim  population  in  Australia  as  “ridiculous”.  He  is  perhaps  too  sanguine.  Even  sane   I  Unlike  human  beings,   not  all  cultures  are  created  equal.   Mark  Baker’s  article  on  Islamophobla,  published  on  March  24.   voices  are  now  predicting  mat  in   Europe,  owing  to  demographic  trends,  Islam  will  replace  Christianity  as  the  dominant  religion,  and  the  indigenous  Europeans  will  eventually  be  outnum   bered.   There  are  now  about  1.6  million  Muslims  in  Britain,  a  figure  matching  the  entire  Jewish  population  of  Europe.  Owing  to  an  enormous  birth  rate,  unprecedented  levels  of  immigra  tion,  and  successful  proselytising,  Muslim  numbers  are  escalating.  By  contrast,  there  are  officially  only  285.000  Jews  in  Britain,  and  even  if  the  true  number  is  320,000  it  does  not  affect  the  imbalance.   In  Australia  there  are,  officially,  84.000  Jews,  compared  to  300,000  Muslims.  Even  if  the  true  number  of  Jews  is  110,000,  the  gap  is  large  and  growing,  and  has  troubling  political  implications,  as  the  European  experi   ence  warns.   In  Britain,  as  in  other  European  nations  with  large  Muslim  minorities,  politicians  are  courting  the  Muslim  vote  at  the  expense  of  Jewish  interests.  Assertive  political  organisations  such  as  the  Muslim  Council  of  Britain  and  the  Muslim  Public  Affairs  Committee  robustly  demonise  Israel  before  gov  ernment  and  public.  The  Respect  party  in  London’s  East  End,  a  union  of  Bangladeshi  Muslims  and  hardline  socialists,  unseated  a  Jewish  woman  MP  during  an  election  campaign  tainted  with  antisemitism  and  vio   lence.  Abetting  this  kind  ot  thing  is  the  New  Statesman,  the  far-leftist  journal  that  Dr  Baker  cites  so  gullibly  in  quot  ing  a  Muslim  who  claims  that  Muslims  would  be  the  victims  of  any  future   Holocaust.   The  unpleasant  truth  is  that  most  antisemitism  in  Europe  today  -  rang  ing  from  abusive  harassment  to  physi  cal  attacks  and  even  murder  -  is  being  perpetrated  by  Muslims.  This  was  the  finding  of  the  report  commissioned  a  few  years  ago  by  the  European  Union,  and  then  suppressed.  Given  the  increasing  political  clout  of  Muslims,  individual  governments  prefer  not  to  confront  this  reality  either,  as  France’s  track  record  shows.  And  neither  does  the  left-liberal  media:  attacks  on  Jews,  no  matter  how  severe,  are  seldom  if  ever  reported  on  the  politically  correct,  Islamophile  BBC,  for  whom  the  only  antisemites,  it  seems,  are  white  neo   Nazis.   NATURALLY,  dialogue  between   Jews  and  Muslims  should  be  encouraged.  There  are  legiti  mate  arenas  where  cooperation  occurs:  the  defence  of  ritual  slaughter  ing,  for  instance.  But  in  Britain  and   Australia  most  of  the  links  seem  to  be  with  Turkish  Muslims.  Turkey  has  a  long  tradition  of  cordiality  towards  Jews  and  Israel.  Muslims  of  Pakistani,  Bangladeshi,  and  North  African,  espe  cially  Moroccan,  origin  are  the  main  sources  of  so  much  hostility  to  Jews   *  «  «   Is  Islamophobla  a  spurious  term,  which  has  been  used  to  silence  or  Intimidate   legitimate  concerns  about  Islam?  Photo:  Isranet   and  to  Israel  in  Europe  today.  Many  of  these  are  angry  and  alienated  young  men,  who  blend  the  worst  of  urban  culture  with  an  aggressive  Islamicism,  treat  girls  and  women  with  contempt,  and  create  “no-go”  neighbourhoods.  Sadly,  it  is  hard  to  imagine  where  rap  prochement  with  such  groups  might  be  reached,  save  on  the  betrayal  of  democratic  values,  and  on  the  corpse   of  Israel.   “Islamophobia”  is  in  some  ways  a  spurious  term,  which  has  been  used  to  silence  or  intimidate  legitimate  con  cerns  about  Islam.  For  example,  the  Muslim  Council  of  Britain  dubbed  a  female  journalist  “Islamophobe  of  the  Year”  for  criticising  the  status  of  women  in  Islam.  There  are  fears  that  certain  legislation  demanded  by  Mus   lims  would  make  the  most  innocuous   questioning  of  religious  beliefs  a  crim   inal  offence.   Dr  Baker  enjoins  Jews  to  defend  Sharia  law.  As  a  woman,  as  a  Progres  sive  Jew,  and  as  a  child  of  the  European  Enlightenment,  I  for  one  would  find  that  difficult.  Would  Dr  Baker  expect  us  to  defend  the  physical  punishment   ♦   of  “disobedient”  wives  (a  practice  strenuously  upheld  by  some  European  imams),  or,  like  the  Israeli  authorities  in  their  bid  to  appease  Palestinians,  passively  acquiesce  in  the  “honour  killings”  of  errant  Muslim  daughters?  The  Muslim  mayor  of  one  London  borough  insisted  on  the  segregation  of  women  at  his  civic  inauguration,  and  herded  them  into  a  side  room.  Would  Dr  Baker  have  us  support  a  Muslim  mayor  of  an  Australian  town  who  did  likewise?  When  John  Howard  and  Peter  Costello  suggest  that  certain  practices  and  outlooks  are  not  in  keep  ing  with  Australian  liberal  democratic  values,  Jews  should  support  them.   It  is  only  in  liberal  democracies  that  Judaism  has  been  allowed  to  flourish.  Unlike  human  beings,  not  all  cultures  are  created  equal.  In  view  of  the  oppressive  nature  of  some  cultures,  it  is  surely  an  abrogation  of  our  duties  to  ourselves  as  Australians  and  as  Jews  to  pretend  that  they  are.

"  I   3   I   turn  to  faith  in  the  of  cartoon  violence   RABBI  AVI  SHAFRAN  reflects  on  recent  events  affecting   Muslim  attitudes  to  Jews  and  the  West.   IRST  we  witnessed  riots,  torching  of  embassies,  curses,  threats  and  attacks  on  people  in  response  to  the  Danish  car  toons  that  mocked  Islam.   And  then  came  the  telling  reaction.  Farid  Mortazavi,  an  editor  at  Iran’s  largest  newspaper,  offered  a  prize  for  the  best  cartoons  discrediting  the   Holocaust   The  Arab  European  League,  which  says  that  one  of  its  principles  is  to  “fight  every  form  of  racism”,  posted  on   its  website  a  series  of  its  own  creative  caricatures  implying  that  the  Holo  caust  is  a  Jewish  fabrication  (one  of  them,  peculiarly,  portraying  Hitler  sharing  a  bed  with  Anne  Frank).   If  you’re  wondering  why  Muslims  angered  by  actions  in  largely  Christian  countries  choose  to  vent  their  consid  erable  spleen  at  Jews,  well,  welcome  to  contemporary  times  -  pungently  rem  iniscent,  of  course,  of  earlier  ones.   Leave  aside,  though,  the  oddity  of   Abdul,  insulted  by  Chris,  attacking  Yankel.  Leave  aside  even  that  to  deny  the  Holocaust  is  to  lie,  while  to  connect  some  Muslims’  bad  behaviour  with  the   faith  they  claim  as  their  justification  is  to  simply  take  them  at  their  word.   Consider  only  the  truly  astounding  hypocrisy,  societies  whose  media  teem  with  patently  libellous,  venom-satu  rated,  inflammatory  words  and  images  about  Jews  are  outraged  at  the  idea  of  an  impolite  press.   To  be  sine,  there  are  sane  Islamic  voices.  Muhammad  al-Hamadi,  writ  ing  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates’  A1  Ittihad,  contends  that  “We  [Muslims]  must  be  honest  with  ourselves  and  admit  that  we  are  the  reason  for  these   drawings.  Any  harm  to  Islam  is  a  result   of  Muslims  who  have  come  to  reflect  the  worst  image  of  Islam.”   And,  in  a  letter  to  the  New  York  Times,  Saleem  Ahmed,  an  author  of  books  about  Islamic  teachings,  sug  gests  that  “instead  of  torching  Danish  and  other  embassies,  Muslims  should  torch  the  cause  of  European  anger:  extremist  Muslim  literature  inciting  suicide  bombers  and  other  terrorists”.   We  must  appreciate  words  like   these  and  hope  that  they  reflect  a  larger  portion  of  the  Islamic  world  than  the  crazed  images  that  scowl  at  us  from  die  front  pages  these  days.   But  neither  can  we  ignore  the  Mus  lim  in  the  street  or  some  pulpits  whose  approach  may  be  very  different   Jews  don’t  preach  violence  against  other  religions.  We  would  be  overjoyed  if  adherents  of  Islam  followed  its  pre  cepts  aS  understood  by  many  Muslims:  tolerance  and  goodwill.   What  is  more,  we  do  not  engage  in  public  mockery  of  other  faiths  and  can  well  relate  (if  only  from  our  own  expe  rience  with  much  of  the  Arab  press)  to  the  sense  of  outrage  felt  at  such  things.   But  neither  do  Jews  riot  when  we  are  portrayed,  as  so  often  we  are,  as  horrible  monsters,  nor  even  when  the  cold-blooded  murder  of  one-third  of  our  people  is  made  into  a  sick  joke  or   derided  as  a  lie.   Some  might  surmise  that  the  rea  son  for  our  reticence  is  fear  of  conse   quences.  After  all,  Jews  comprise  a  mere  fraction  of  one  per  cent  of  the  world’s  populace;  if  we  were  to  go  on  a  rampage,  it  would  not  likely  be  as  long-lived  as  the  recent  Muslim  one.   Others  might  point  to  the  proclivity  in  Jewish   circles  for  social  liberal   ism,  including  the   embrace  of  ideals  like  the   “right”  of  free  expression.   But  there  is  something  deeper,  I  think,  that  explains  the  lack  of  Jewish  “sturm  und  drang”  despite  the  abundance  of   antisemitic  abuse.   It  lies  in  a  fundamental   Jewish  religious  attitude,  one  articulated  at  the  end  of  the  mainstay  of  every  Jewish  prayer  service:  the   silent  Amidah.   Its  penultimate  paragraph  begins:  “My  God,  guard  my  tongue  from  evil  and  my  lips  from  speaking  deceitfully.  To  those  who  curse  me,  let  my  soul  be   silent”   The  sentiment  is  not  one  of  resig  nation,  but  of  faith  in  a  power  stronger  than  any  mortal  one.  It  is  the  utterance  of  one  who  does  not  feel  the  need  to  vent  fury  or  to  counter  insult  in  kind,  someone  who  has  confidence  in  the  final  victory  of  truth  and  of  justice.   Yaakov  Kirschen,  The  Jerusalem  Post,  Dry  Bones   It  is  a  prayer  that  has  imbued  the  collective  Jewish  soul  for  centuries  and  continues  to  today.   And  in  a  vein  reminiscent  of  the  famed  Bruria  who  emphasised  that  we  do  not  seek  the  demise  of  chotim  (sin  ners)  but  rather  the  demise  of  chataim  (evil  itself),  it  continues:  “As  to  all  those  who  plot  evil  against  me,  quickly  oblit  erate  their  plans  and  wreak  havoc  on   their  intentions.”   AM  ECHAD  RESOUKoba   Avi  Shafran  is  director  of  public  affairs  for   Agudath  Israel  of  America.

"  Outlook   The  cartoon  ‘jihad’   Was  the  virtual  “jihad”  that  erupted  over  the  Danish  cartoons  of  the  Prophet   Mohammed  proof  of  the  chaos  theory?  Or  did  it  simply  show  the  real  face  of  the  Muslim  world?  We  selected  leading  Jews  to  offer  their  view.   BRUCE  WOLPE   Director,  Corporate  Affairs,  Fairfax   THE  depiction  of  the  Prophet  Mohammed  was   considered  blasphemous  by  many  Muslims,  and  was  therefore  seen  as  a  vilification  of  the  religion.  And  by  depicting  Mohammed  as  al  Qaeda,  they  could  also  be  seen  as  a  wilful  corruption  of  the  argument  that  true  Islam   does  not  countenance  terrorism.   Many  in  the  Jewish  community  have  con  demned  cartoons  in  Fairfax  newspapers  for  their  commentary  on  Israel  and  Jewish  history  -  and  understandably  so.  And  there  is  anguish  over  Holocaust  cartoons  in  the  Arab   media.   These  events  present  a  unique  opportuni  ty  for  outreach  to  the  Muslim  community  here  to  stand  together  against  religious  vilifi  cation  of  all  Semitic  peoples  in  the  media  -   wherever  it  occurs.

However,  at  the  same  time,  we  must  show  respect  for  one  another,  for  our  different  customs  and  beliefs.  We  must  be  free  also  of  ridicule,  of  vilification,  of  discrimination.  Free  dom  of  speech  and  respectful  restraint  are  not  mutually  exclusive.  The  Danish  cartoons  were  offensive  and  inappropriate,  but  at  the  same  time,  the  response  of  people  affected  by  the  cartoons  should  have  been  within  the  standards  acceptable  in  a  civil  society.   The  adage,  “We  should  all  do  unto  others  as  we  would  have  them  do  unto  us”  applies  to  all  parties  in  this  debate.

I  enjoyed  Michael  Leunig  of  the  Age  until  he  let  his  smiling  mask  slip.  With  one  scribble  he  managed  to  produce  Aus  tralian  journalism's  most  offensive  sketch  in  which  he  linked  Israel  with  the  gates  of  Auschwitz.  After  that,  I  knew  I  could  never  trust  Leunig's  judgment  or  his  core  beliefs  again.   I  am  very  uneasy  when  people’s  religious  beliefs  are  mocked.  I  hated  it  when  an  artist  who  obviously  lacked  any  talent,  but  nursed  a  broiges  against  Christianity,  produced  “Piss   Christ”.   Last  week  in  Melbourne's  broadsheet  newspaper,  I  deplored  the  publication  of  car  toons  that  were  offensive  to  Muslims.  I  also  applaud  the  concept  of  a  “civil  society”  in  which  people  of  differing  beliefs  have  a  com  mitment  to  live  together  with  peace.  I  am  a  child  of  the  Enlightenment  I  actually  believe  that  the  search  for  truth  is  relentless  and  worthwhile.  I  am  alarmed  when  more  than  one  billion  people  can  be  mustered  to  protest  against  a  cartoon.   I  am  waiting  for  Muslims  around  the  world  to  protest  against  the  anti-Jewish  car  toons  and  vile  TV  shows  that  are  distributed  in  the  Muslim  world.  I  have  walked  into  a  Jor  danian  shop  in  a  hotel  in  Amman  and  seen  DerSturmer-Wke  covers  on  books  laid  out  for  sale.  It  didn’t  stop  that  same  hotel  being  the  scene  of  a  savage  suicide  bombing.  Who   opened  Pandoras  boxr   MICHAEL  DANBY  Federal  member,  Melbourne  Ports   CARTOONISTS  should  not  deliberately  cause   offence  to  any  religion.  But  it  is  hypocntical  for  radical  Islamists  to  fly  into  a  rage  about  these  cartoons  when  they  condone  the  publication  of  vicious  antisemitic  cartoons  in  the  Arab   media.  Cartoonists  can  be  criticised  but  not  censored  -  not  even  Michael  Leunig.   It  was  ironic  to  see  Leunig  insisting  that  the  Age  and  the  SMH  not  publish  cartoons  offensive  to  Muslims,  after  his  own  obsessive  and  offensive  cartoons  denigrating  Israel  and  Jews.  The  mob  violence  in  Arab  countries  is  out  of  all  proportion  to  the  issue  and  will  serve  only  to  reinforce  negative  views  of   AraDs  ana  Muslims.

There  are  thousands  from  which  to  choose.  It  should  then  run  a  poll  of  its  readers  to  select  the  least  offensive.   This  to  ridicule  the  hypocrisy  of  the  Mid  dle  Eastern  press,  and  mock  the  cant  of  some  Muslim  responses,  to  what  was,  after  all,  the  inept  behaviour  of  a  Danish  Christian   newspaper.   On  a  more  serious  note,  I  observe  with  alarm  how  a  Lutheran  publication  has  mor  phed  into  an  anti-Jewish  reply  by  hysterical   and  violent  Muslim  mobs.   MELANIE  LANDAU   Lecturer,  Australian  Cen  tre  for  the  Study  of  Jew  ish  Civilisation,  Monash  University   THIS  is  an  opportunity  tor   Australians  to  engage  in  dialogue  aooui  mui   ticulturalism,  pluralism  and  the  limits  of  democracy.  Self-righteousness  about  the  way  Jews  react  to  incitement  is  not  helpful  here.  We  are  accustomed  to  living  and  adapting  as  a  minority.  Violent  responses  and  life  threats,  as  experienced  overseas,  are  deplorable.   By  the  same  token,  we  shouldn’t  misuse  freedom  of  expression  to  incite  others.  We  need  to  build  more  mutual  trust  so  that  polit  ical  satire  is  not  seen  as  purely  offensive.  It  is  an  ongoing  process.  We  need  to  hold  free  dom  of  expression  in  one  hand  and  freedom  from  incitement  in  the  other.   VICALHADEFF   CEO,  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies   FREEDOM  of  speech  is  not  an  absolute.  It  is  what  remains  after  tak   ing  into  consideration  laws  concerning  defamation,  blasphemy,  incitement,  official  secrecy  and  contempt  of  court   Everything  that  is  published  therefore  car   lies  a  responsibility,  including  cartoons.   Two  other  points  emerge:   •  The  cartoons  have  been  deliberately  exploited  for  political  mileage;  they  were  first  published  last  September,  with  no  worldwide  protests;   ®  The  antisemitism  which  is  found  in  some  Islamist  media  illustrates  the  double  standard  which  states  that  it  is  acceptable  to  vilify  Jews,  but  all  other  forms  of  denigration   are  to  be  condemned.   RACHAEL  KOHN  Broadcaster,  ABC  Radio   HAVING  seen  many  blood-curdling  cartoons   in  the  official  Arab  press  of  Jews  eating  Pales  tinian  children  and  making  Passover  matzah  from  their  blood,  the  Danish  cartoons  were  a  non-event  Except  that  they  caused  murder  and  mayhem.   Why?  Because  they  were  a  pretext  for  a  worldwide  campaign  of  organised  violence,  for  as  we  know,  the  people  on  the  streets  had  not  actually  seen  the  cartoons.  They  were  simply  told  by  the  Bin  Laden  fan  club  that  Islam  had  been  offended  and  westerners  must  pay.   Some  did  with  their  lives  in  an  ironic  con  firmation  of  the  cartoons,  whose  aim  was  not  to  insult  Islam  but  poke  fun  at  fanaticism.  Sadly,  it's  no  laughing  matter.   RABBI  JEREMY  LAWRENCE  Senior  rabbi,   Great  Synagogue   WE  have  experienced   enough  racist  cartoons   and  been  the  victims  of  sufficient  published  libels  to  understand  the  pain  and  the  dan  gers  of  unfettered  art  and  print  Experience  has  taught  how  the  propagandist  bolsters  prejudice  and  foments  oppression;  how   stereotypes  project  subliminal  associations.  In  many  of  the  societies  who  offend  the   greatest,  there  is  not  even  the  right  of  reply  or  the  opportunity  to  counter  satirical  allu   sion  with  fact  Free  speech  is  more  a  privi  lege  than  a  right  It  is  a  privilege  that  should  be  exercised  with  sensitivity,  rather  than  a  right  to  be  flaunted  indiscriminately.   While  the  distinction  between  acceptable  satirical  expression  and  obscenity  is  deeply  subjective,  it  is  difficult  to  be  sympathetic  to  those  whose  response  to  a  perceived  outrage  in  print  is  the  outrageous  assault  on  property  and  life  that  we  have  witnessed  in  the  last  few  days.   It  is  difficult,  too,  to  reconcile  the  cry  of  “foul”  by  those  nations  who  have  made  a  fine-art  form  of  antisemitic  and  Holocaust   denial  caricatures,  and  who  encourage  inter  national  competitions  of  this  genre.   Equity  requires  that  those  who  wish  to  have  their  views  accepted  within  a  free  soci  ety  must  respect  the  freedoms  afforded  to  the  views  of  others.  They  must  seek  redress  through  mediation  or  litigation  -  not  through   intimidation.   RABBI  BENZION  MILECKI   Rabbi,  South  Head  Synagogue   DhMUUKAUY  cannot   function  without  freedom   of  speech,  including  the  right  to  ridicule  the  beliefs  and  ideals  of  others.  Although  this  often  leads  to  gross  discomfort,  embarrass  ment  and  even  ridicule,  we  should  not  have  it  any  other  way.  As  Churchill  famously  said:  “Democracy  is  the  worst  form  of  government,  except  for  all  those  other  forms  that  have  been  tried  from  time  to  timer   Unfortunately,  it  is  not  possible  to  exclude  religion  from  this  freedom  -  both  because  the  definition  of  religion  is  a  matter  of  opinion,  with  many  cults  and  political  ideologies  mas  querading  under  its  name,  and  because  there  are  dastardly  acts  perpetrated  in  the  name  of  religion  that  deserve  to  be  held  up   to  ridicule.   Nevertheless,  individuals  and  newspa  pers  have  a  moral  responsibility  not  to  gratu  itously  offend  the  sensitivities  of  others.  One  should  also  bear  in  mind  that  blasphemy  is  a  capital  sin  and  is  included  in  the  seven   Noachide  laws.   DR  COLIN  RUBENSTHN  Executive  director,  Aus  tralia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish   Affairs  Council   MUSLIMS  offended  by   the  cartoons  have  every  right  to  peaceful  protest  -  but  instead  we  see  violence,  intim  idation,  support  for  terror,  and  targeting  of  people  unconnected  with  the  cartoons.  Part  of  the  problem  is  Middle  Eastern  despots  using  this  issue  to  distract  from  domestic  problems,  but  the  violent  reaction  has  clear  ly  been  broader  than  this.  Hypocrisy  in  the  Arab  world,  with  protests  of  these  cartoons  accompanied  by  widespread  antisemitism  and  Holocaust  denial  in  their  own  press,  shows  there  is  a  deeper  problem  of  political  culture  here.  Western  governments  must  ensure  that  our  fundamental  values  of  toler  ance,  openness  and  freedom  of  religion  are  not  compromised  or  subject  to  intimidation. ",2006-02-17

"  ‘Moderate5  Muslims  blasted  over  Hezbollah   MELISSA  SINGER   JEWISH  leaders  have  blasted  two  so   called  “moderate”  Muslim  community  leaders  for  publicly  supporting   Hezbollah.   Rabbi  John  Levi,  a  pioneer  of  Jew  ish-Muslim  inter-faith  dialogue  arid   co-founder  of  the  Council  of  Chris  tians  and  Jews,  expressed  his  “shock”  over  Sheikh  Fehmi  Naji  El-imam  and  former  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria  (ICV)  president  Yasser  Soliman’s  praise  for  Hezbollah  “freedom  fight  ers”  at  a  rally  in  Melbourne  on  Sunday.   “I  am  very  shocked,  but  unfortu  nately  not  surprised,”  said  Rabbi  Levi,  who  is  also  deputy  president  of  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  and  rabbi  emeritus  of  Temple  Beth   Israel.   Rabbi  Levi  told  the  AJN  that   Hezbollah  flags  were  on  display  at  the  rally  In  Melbourne  last  weekend.   Photo:  Andrew  Lenderyou   Sheikh  Fehmi’s  comments  to  the  1500-strong  crowd,  many  of  whom  carried  Hezbollah  flags  or  anti-Israel  banners,  follows  a  trend  of  the  past  five  years  that  has  seen  the  Preston  Mosque  imam  “reading  speeches  pre  pared  by  someone  else  using  language   that  isn’t  his  own”.   “Nothing  can  excuse  Sheikh  Fehmi's   destruction  of  decades  long  work  on  Jewish   Muslim  understanding.”   RABBI  JOHN  LEVI   Inter-faith  pioneer   “Obviously  [Sheikh  Fehmi]  is  under  great  pressure  from  a  radi  calised  community,  but  nothing  can  excuse  his  destruction  of  decades-long  work  on  Jewish-Muslim  understand  ing,”  Rabbi  Levi  said.

"  British  Jews,  Muslims  fight  school  quotas   GEORGE  CONGER   LONDON  -  Jewish  leaders  have  joined  their  Muslim  and  Catholic  counterparts  in  objecting  to  pro  posed  government  regulations  requiring  new  faith  schools  to  set  aside  up  to  one-third  of  their  places   for  members  of  other  faiths.   It  is  “nonsensical”  for  the  govern  ment  to  force  a  quota  plan  upon  Jew  ish  schools  that  would  see  non-Jews  favoured  over  Jews,  the  chief  execu  tive  officer  of  the  Board  of  Deputies  of  British  Jews,  Jon  Benjamin,  said  in  response  to  the  proposed  law.   A  bill  submitted  by  former  edu  cation  secretary  Lord  Kenneth  Baker,  which  comes  before  the  House  of  Lords  for  debate  this   month,  requires  new  voluntary  aided  faith  schools  to  fill  up  to  30  per  cent  of  their  school  population  with  children  from  a  different  faith  or  a   non-faith  background.   Britain’s  Education  Secretary  Alan  Johnson  is  understood  to  support  the  proposal  based  on  the  belief  that  it   ♦  ♦  ♦   would  reduce  religious  and  racial   tensions.   Tahir  Alam,  the  chairman  of  the  education  committee  of  the  Muslim   Council  of  Britain,  said  the  proposed  law  was  not  the  best  way  forward.  “Locking  two  people  in  the  same  room  ...  is  not  the  best  way  of  creating  inte  gration”  he  told  the  BBC.   While  the  proposed  regulation  would  only  affect  new  schools,  critics  charge  it  would  have  a  disproportion   ate  effect  on  non-Christian  schools.  At   the  start  of  the  current  academic  year,  the  Church  of  England  supported  4646   schools  and  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  2041  schools,  while  there  were  39  Jewish,  8  Muslim  and  2  Sikh  schools.   “The  Jewish  experience  over  many  years  is  that  faith  schools  have  enhanced  the  ability  of  the  community  to  maintain  its  cultural  heritage  while  producing  active  British  citizens  who  play  a  full  part  in  society,”  Benjamin  said,  noting  that  the  “consequences  of  Lord  Balter’s  amend  ment  would  be  to  exclude  Jewish  stu  dents  from  Jewish  day  schools”.

"  Some  of  the  15,000-plus  pro-Lebanese  demonstrators  at  Saturday’s  rally  In  Sydney,  one  of  the  biggest  demonstrations  around   the  world.  Photo:  AP/AAP   Why  do  they  love  to  hate  us?   VIEWPOINT   YAIR  LAPID   In  the  final  analysis,  it  is   impossible  to  understand  the  Arab  and  Muslim  world's  utter  hatred  for  Israel.   NE  hundred  years  of  con   jflict,  billions  of  wasted  dol  lars,  tens  of  thousands  of  people  killed  -  all  this,  and  it  is  still  impossible  to  understand.   It’s  not  only  what  has  happened.  It   is  also  what  did  not  occur  -  the  hos  pitals  that  were  never  built,  the  uni  versities  that  never  opened,  the  roads  that  were  never  paved,  three  years   stolen  from  the  lives  of  millions  of  young  people  in  uniform.  Despite  everything,  we  are  still  clueless  as  to  the  core  of  the  riddle:  why  do  they   hate  us  so  much?   I  am  not  talking  about  the  Pales   tinians  this  time.  The  conflict  with  them  is  intimate,  focused,  and  has  a  direct  impact  on  their  day-to-day  liv  ing.  But  the  others  -  they  are  impos  sible  to  understand.  Why  does   Hezbollah  leader  Sheikh  Hassan  Nas   rallah  -  together  with  his  tens  of   thousands  of  minions  -  dedicate  his  life  and  his  considerable  talent,  as  well  as  the  fate  of  his  country,  to  wage  a  war  against  a  country  that  he  has  never  seen,  people  he  has  never  met  and  an  army  he  has  no  reason  to  fight?   Why  do  children  in  Iran  who  can  not  even  point  to  Israel  on  a  map  (mostly  because  it  is  so  small)  bum  its  flag  in  the  city  square  and  volunteer   to  commit  suicide  in  order  to  destroy  it?  Why  are  the  Syrians  willing  to  stay  in  a  pathetic  and  oppressive  Third  World  country  in  exchange  for  the  questionable  privilege  of  serving  as  patrons  to  terror  organisations?  Why  do  they  hate  us  in  Saudi  Arabia,  in  Iraq,  in  the  Sudan?  What  have  we  done  to  them?  And  why  do  they  hate  us  so  much  in  Afghanistan,  where  people  are  starving?  Where  do  they  take  the  strength  to  hate?   |  There  are  so  many  ways  !  to  love  your  brother  |  why  do  they  prefer  to   help  him  to  hate?   Is  it  about  solidarity  with  their  Palestinian  brothers  and  sisters?  If  so,  then  where  are  the  tractors  from   Saudi  Arabia  for  rebuilding  Gush   Katif?  Where  is  the  Indonesian  team   that  is  supposed  to  come  and  build  a  school  in  Gaza?  Where  are  the  doctors   from  Kuwait  with  the  latest  in  surgical  equipment?  There  are  so  many  ways  to  love  your  brother,  why  do  they  pre  fer  to  help  him  to  hate?   Some  1500  years  of  antisemitism  have  taught  us  an  excruciatingly  painful  lesson  -  there  is  something  about  us  that  annoys  the  world.  So  we  did  the  thing  that  everyone  wanted  -  we  left  We  established  our  own  tiny  country  where  we  could  annoy  each  other  without  bothering  anyone  else.  Indeed,  most  of  the  towns  and  cities  bombed  this  week  were  not  stolen   from  anyone.  Nahariyah,  Afula  and   Carmiel  never  existed  until  we   founded  them.  Haifa  has  a  history  of  Jewish  presence  since  the  third  cen  tury  before  the  common  era.   Nevertheless  the  hatred  continues,  and  it  is  toxic  and  insatiable.  Last  week,  Iranian  President  Mahmoud  Ahmadinejad  called  for  the  State  of  Israel  “to  be  eliminated”,  as  if  we  were  some  kind  of  bacteria.  We’ve  become  so  accustomed  to  his  declarations   that  we  don’t  even  argue.   i   AM  trying  but  cannot  remember:  What  did  we  do  to  them?  When?   H  How?  Why  is  the  Iranian  presi  dent  saying,  “The  Muslim  world’s  main  problem  is  Israel?”  There  are  more  than  a  billion  Muslims  in  the  world.  Most  live  in  substandard  con   ditions.  They  suffer  from  hunger,  poverty,  ignorance;  blood-soaked  conflicts  that  extend  from  Kashmir  to  Kurdistan  and  from  Darfur  to  Bangladesh.  And  we  are  their  main  problem?   I  refuse  to  accept  the  argument  that  “that’s  the  way  they  are”.  They  used  to  say  that  about  us  and  we’ve  grown  to  suspect  the  statement.  There  has  to  be  another  reason,  a  dark  secret  that  convinced  residents  of  southern  Lebanon  to  escalate   things  along  a  quiet  border,  to  kidnap  soldiers  of  an  army  that  had  with  drawn  from  their  territory,  and  to  turn  their  country  into  islands  of  rubble  precisely  at  a  time  that  they  had  finally  extricated  themselves  from  20  years  of  rack  and  ruin.   We  have  become  accustomed  to   telling  ourselves  things  such  as:  “The  Iranians  are  responsible”,  or  “Syria  is  stirring  things  up  behind  the  scenes”  But  that  is  really  too  simplistic.   What  about  the  people?  What  do  they  think?  What  about  their  hopes,  their  loves,  their  aspirations  and  dreams?  What  about  their  children?  Do  they  really  believe  that  hating  us  is  enough  of  a  reason  to  send  their  children  off  to  die?

"  Israelis  evicted  from  Fiji   (TAMAR  E1CHNER   THREE  Israeli  backpackers  who  had  been  travelling  in  Australia  say  they  were  evicted  from  Fiji  after  a  Muslim  immigration  officer  accused  them  of  humiliating  Palestinians  during  their  military  service.   The  three  -  Amit  Ronen,  Eldar  Avracohen,  and  Nimrod  Lahav  -  left  Israel  in  February  to  travel  Australia.   Last  month  they  decided  to  spend  a  week  in  Fiji,  arriving  at  Fiji  airport  on  July  13.   “We  gave  our  passports  to  the  offi  cer,  and  when  she  saw  we  are  Israelis  she  asked  for  ID  cards.  We  told  her  we  didn’t  understand  why  we  need  ID  cards  and  she  responded,  shouting:  ‘You  know  very  well  how  to  ask  Pales  tinians  for  IDs  and  humiliate  them  for  three  years’.”   That’s  what  Avracohen  wrote  in  a  complaint  letter  he  sent  to  Israeli   Israeli   Ambassador  Natl  Tamlr  (left)   greets  Fijian   President  Ratu  Josefa  llolovatu  Uluivuda  in  Suva  last  year.

Avracohen  added  that  the   incident  was  the  most  humiliating  experience  he  had  ever  gone  through.

"  Cartoon:  Riker  Hansson,   Svenska   Dagbladet,  Stockholm,   Sweden   ADL:  Arab  press  more   antisemitic  than  ever   HILARY  LEILA  KRIEGER   JERUSALEM  -  The  Mohammed  car  toon  controversy  greatly  increased  the   amount  of  antisemitic  material  in  Arab  and  Muslim  newspapers,  according  to  a  report  issued  by  the   New  York-based  Anti-Defamation   League  (ADL)  last  weekend.   The  report  highlighted  cartoons  and  opinion  pieces  that  demonised  Jews,  Israel  and  the  Holocaust  in  media  across  the  Arab  world  and  in  Iran.   The  publications  cited  depicted  Jews  in  “outrageous  and  deeply  anti  semitic  caricatures  and  themes,  including  antisemitic  conspiracy  the  ories  of  Jews  plotting  to  control  US  foreign  policy  and  dominate  the  world”,  the  report  said.   For  example,  in  the  government  daily  Al-Ittihad  from  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  a  cartoon  of  a  Jew  holding  the  world  at  bay  with  a  gun  labelled  “the  Holocaust”  was  published  on  January  24.  And,  in  an  apparent  refer   ence  to  the  Mohammed  cartoons  on   February  16,  the  Bahraini  Akhbar  al  Khalij  ran  a  picture  of  an  inkpot   marked  with  a  Star  of  David  accom   panied  by  a  pen  writing  “cartoons  harming  Allah’s  messenger”.   ADL  national  director  Abraham  Foxman  said  that  Muslim  and  Arab   leaders  have  a  “blind  spot”  and  a   “level  of  tolerance”  for  “blatant  anti  semitism”  in  the  media.

"  MISSING  THE  POINT   JULIE  Szego’s  column  (AJN  29/9),  in  which  she  compares  Prime  Minister  John  Howard’s  pronouncement  to  the  Australian  Muslim  community  to  “assimilate  in  the  Australian  culture  and  learn  English”  with  the  some  of  the  insular  Orthodox  Jews  and  the  general  Jewish  population,  really  miss  es  the  point  in  Howard’s  statement   After  9/11,  western  countries  with  a  large  Muslim  population  worried  about  a  fifth  column  living  among  their  citizens  and,  even  though  most  of  the  Muslims  living  in  those  countries,  including  Australia,  are  moderates,  there  are  some  who  profess  the  over  throw  of  western  regimes  to  be  replaced  by  shari’a  law.   You  never  heard  Howard  or  Peter  Costello  urging  the  Australian  Muslim  population  to  integrate  in  the  Aus  tralian  way  of  life  or  speak  English  upon  arriving  in  Australia  before  9/11.  These  announcements  were  forced  upon  these  politicians  because  of  the  increasing  pressure  to  safeguard  the  lives  of  each  and  every  Australian  —  including  Muslims  -  against  terrorists.   To  compare  the  Australian  Jewish  community  to  the  Muslims  about   integrating  into  the  Australian  way  of  life  is  missing  the  point.   Howard  is  not  against  multicultur  alism;  his  main  priority  is  to  safeguard  Australian  lives.  His  whole  agenda  is  to  integrate  some  of  the  Muslims  into  the   mainstream.

Twenty  students  are  selected  from  each  school  to  participate  in  a  programme  in  which  they  learn  skills  in  communication  and  conflict  transformation,  as  well  as   information  about  the  other  two  faiths.

"  GEDAUAH  AFTERMAN   PRIME  Minister  John  Howard  has  categorically  rejected  a  request  by  the  chairman  of  the  Muslim  Community  Reference  Group,  Dr  Ameer  Ali,  to  “reconsider  the  categorisation  of  Hezbollah  as  a  terrorist  group”.   “Rethink  our  description  of  it?  What,  as  a  terrorist  organisation?  No  chance!  Full  stop.  No  chance  at  all,”  the  prime  minister  told  media  last   week.   It  turns  out,  however,  that  only  the  External  Security  Organisation  (ESO)  of  Hezbollah  is  currently  listed  as  a  terrorist  group  in  Australia  -  while  the  organisation’s  military  wing,  which  is  currently  waging  war  against  Israel  and  raining  Katyushas  on  Israeli  population  centres,  is  not.   Attorney-General  Philip  Ruddock  said  this  week  that  “Hezbollah  is  a   multi-faceted  organisation  including  political,  social  and  military  compo   nents”.   “The  functions  of  the  organisation  include  political  and  social  activities.   Prime  Minister  John  Howard  chats  with  Gold  Coast  Hebrew  Congregation’s  Rabbi  Nir  Gurevich  during  the  PR/i’s  visit  to  Queensland  last  week  during  which  Howard  refuted  suggestions  that  Hezbollah  be  removed  from  the  terror  list.   However,  the  ESO  is  a  distinct  terror  ist  wing  of  Hezbollah,  and  has  been  responsible  for  attacks  dating  back  to  the  early  1980s”   Ruddock  noted  that  ESO,  which  is   believed  to  have  been  behind  the  Buenos  Aires  bombings,  is  also  listed  as  a  terrorist  organisation  by  the  United  Kingdom,  while  the  entirety  of  Hezbollah  is  listed  as  a  terror  group   in  both  the  United  States  and  Canada.   Ruddock  said,  however,  that  the  ""military  or  militia  wing”  of  Hezbol  lah  has  not  been  proscribed  as  a  ter  rorist  organisation  in  Australia,  nor  have  the  political  or  social  compo   nents  of  Hezbollah.   But  he  quickly  added  that  for  the  purposes  of  freezing  financial  assets,  Hezbollah  is  listed  in  its  entirety  and   that  it  is  an  offence  under  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations  Act  1945,  adopted  in  Australia,  to  provide  financial  support  or  assets  of  any  kind   to  Hezbollah.   Federal  Member  for  Melbourne   Ports  Michael  Danby  expressed  sur  prise  at  learning  that  the  military  wing  of  Hezbollah  is  not  listed  as  a  terrorist  group  in  Australia.  Danby  said  he  will  approach  the  attorney  general’s  office  to  clarify  the  matter  and  urged  “all  members  of  the  Aus  tralian  Jewish  community  to  work  for  and  demand  the  prompt  banning  of  Hezbollah’s  military  wing”.

"  Not  the  last  of  Hilaly,  warn  Jewish  leaders   JASON  FRENKEL   JEWISH  leaders  were  cautious  this  week  in  their  condemnation  of  con   troversial  Muslim  cleric  Sheikh  Tajed  din  al-Hilaly,  who  is  facing  widespread  pressure  to  stand  down  for  denigrating   women  in  a  recent  sermon.   Sheikh  Hilaly,  who  has  taken  indefinite  leave  from  his  position  but  has  yet  to  resign  as  either  imam  of  Sydney*s  Lakemba  Mosque  or  Mufti  of  Australia,  last  week  sparked  national  outrage  for  accusing  immodestly  dressed  women  of  inviting  sexual   assault.   But  while  Jewish  community  leaders  joined  the  chorus  criticising  Sheikh  Hilaly’s  comments,  they  warned  the  furore  might  not  be  the  end  of  his  controversial  reign  as  Aus   tralia’s  most  senior  Muslim  cleric.   They  also  said  the  issue  was  one  that  the  Muslim  community  needed  to  resolve  internally.   Dr  Rodney  Gouttman,  a  political  analyst  at  the  B’nai  B’rith  Anti  Defamation  Commission,  said  Muslims  would  be  reluctant  to  be  seen   as  bowing  to  outside  pressure.   “The  Jewish  community  must  be   careful  not  to  interfere  in  this  in  the   wrong  way,”  he  said.  “It  is  a  Muslim  community  affair  ...  We’re  not  in  a  position  to  tell  them  how  to  run  their   own  affairs.”   Jeremy  Jones,  community  affairs  director  at  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jew  ish  Affairs  Council,  said  Shiekh  Hilal/s  outrageous  comments  would  further  erode  his  dwindling  support  base.

Photo:  AIN  file   meeting  of  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils,  Jones  said   “This  is  something  which  is  being  seen  as  well  beyond  the  pale,”  he  told  the  AJN  this  week  “He’s  on  the  slide;  certainly  within  his  own  community  he  doesn’t  have  enormous  support.”   The  latest  furore  was  triggered  by  Sheikh  Hilal/s  Ramadan  sermon  in  Sydney  last  month,  when  he  report  edly  told  500  followers  that  victims  of  sex  attacks  only  had  themselves  to  blame.  “If  you  take  out  uncovered  meat  and  place  it  outside  in  the  street,  or  in  the  garden  or  in  the  park  or  in  the  backyard  without  a  cover,  and  the  cats  come  and  eat  it...  whose  fault  is  it,  the  cats  or  the  uncovered  meat?  The  uncovered  meat  is  the  problem.”   Jewish  author  and  feminist  Yvonne  Fein  described  Sheikh  Hilal/s  com  ments  as  “prehistoric”  and  “primitive”.   Attempts  by  the  imam  to  explain  his  comments  as  only  referring  to  prostitutes  were  “a  complete  disaster”,  she  said  “He’s  got  a  lot  to  answer  for  even  bringing  this  issue  up.

To  the  extent  which  they  continue  to  support  him,  he  may  well  return,  but  if  they  have  had  enough  -  perhaps  because  they  fee!  he's  embarrassed  them-  then  he  won't,”  Dr  Mendes  said.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  president  Grahame  Leonard  said  the  fiasco  was  a  chance  for  moderate  Muslims  to  draw  a  line  in  the  sand  with  the  radical  cleric.   “We  are  encouraged  by  the  remarks  of  the  overwhelming  majority  of  Muslim  and  political  ieadens  in  condemning  the  sheikh's  reported  comments”  Leonard  .said.,';   Sheikh  Hilaiy  amVed  in  Austialia  in  1982  and  has  rarely  been  out  of  the  spotlight  since.  In  1988,  he  told  a  Uni  versity  of  Sydney  audience  that  Jews  were  “the  underlying  cause  of  all  wars  threatening  the  peace  and  security  of  the  whole  inhabited  earth”,  and  that  the  Torah  was  a  forgery.   Attempts  by  the  Labor  Government  to  have  him  deported  in  1986  v/ere  shelved  amid  fears  of  a  ballot-box  backlash  in  crucial  Sydney  seats.   Jones,  who  was  part  of  the  ECAJ  sec  retariat  when  Sheikh  Hilaly  received  residency,  described  it  as  a  major  set  back  for  multicultural  Australia.   “[Sheikh]  Hilaly  being  made  a  per  manent  resident  in  Australia  was  one  of  the  worst  things  that  ever  happened  to  multiculturalism  and  to  Jewish-Musiim  relations  in  Australia.   “We  were  given  to  understand  by  the  Australian  political  leadership  that  one  of  the  things  that  he  would  do  as  a  condi  tion  of  getting  permanent  residency  was  apologise  and  retract  his  antisemitic  comments  from  the  University  of  Sydney  in  1988-  and  we're  still  waiting.”   OUTLOOK  14-Editorial ",2006-11-03
"  The  double  life  of  Iranian  Jews   RACHEL  SILVERMAN   NEW  YORK  -  Iran  wouldn’t  appear  to  be  a  likely  candidate  to  house  the  largest  Jewish  community  in  the  Mus   lim  world.   After  all,  Iran  is  run  by  a  funda  mentalist  Islamic  regime  whose  presi  dent  has  threatened  to  destroy  Israel  and  who  regularly  denies  the  Holo  caust.  But  Mahmoud  Ahmadinejad’s  Iran  currently  is  home  to  an  estimated  25,000  Jews.   Iranian  Jews  have  lived  in  the  region  for  more  than  2700  years.  Dur  ing  that  time,  they’ve  survived  waves  of  forced  conversion,  antisemitic  propa  ganda,  derogatory  dress  codes  and  economic,  legal  and  social  persecu   tion.   But  there  have  also  been  times   when  they  flourished,  like  they  did  under  the  pro-western  regime  of  Shah  Mohammed  Reza  Pahlavi,  who  ruled  until  the  Islamists  took  over  in  the  late  1970s.  Indeed,  some  100,000  Jews  lived  in  Iran  before  the  1979  Islamic  Revolu  tion  prompted  an  exodus.   Through  these  ebbs  and  flows,  Iranian  Jews  have  learned  that  oppres  sors,  no  matter  how  tyrannical,  are  only  temporary  masters.   For  this  reason,  as  George  Haroon  ian,  a  community  activist  in  Los  Ange  les,  put  it,  Iranian  Jews  tend  to  think  of  the  current  antisemitic,  anti-Israel  cli  mate  as  only  “a  temporary  disruption  in  the  long  centuries  of  the  relation  ship  between  Jews  and  Iranians”.   “These  people  know  this  govern  ment  will  vanish,  but  Israel  will  stay  and  Iran  will  stay,”  Haroonian,  who  runs  a  magazine  for  Iranian  Jewish  emigres,  said.   For  many  Iranian  Jews,  that  means  making  their  peace  and  carrying  on,  despite  sporadic  antisemitic  incidents.  In  1999,  13  Iranian  Jews  were  accused  of  spying  for  Israel,  and  10  were  imprisoned.  Though  all  were  released  by  2002,  the  incident  sent  shockwaves  throughout  Iran’s  Jewish  community.   In  other  ways,  too,  the  situation  for  Iranian  Jews  is  difficult.   Antisemitic  propaganda  is  perva  sive,  say  those  interviewed  for  this  arti  cle,  and  Jewish  citizens  have  been  stripped  of  many  rights,  such  as  their   ability  to  provide  testimony  in  court  or  hold  a  position  superior  to  that  of  a   Muslim.   Things  have  gotten  so  bad  that  sev  eral  weeks  ago,  reports  that  Iran  would  be  enacting  a  law  mandating  a  Nazi  like  uniform  for  Jews  was  widely  believed  in  the  West.  That  report,  how  ever,  proved  to  be  false.   To  cope  with  their  lack  of  freedoms,  Jews  in  Iran  have  mastered  the  art  of  separating  their  private  lives  from  their  public  ones.   Outwardly,  Iranian  Jews  do  their  best  to  blend  in  and  stay  quiet   Iranian  Jews,  at  least  publicly,  often  mask  their  affiliations  with  both  Judaism  and  Zionism.  When  an  Iran  ian  Jewish  dance  troupe  travelled  to  Russia  recently,  several  members  refused  to  eat  pieces  of  cake  decorated  with  the  Israeli  flag.   “Jews  in  Iran  have   become  more  religious  since  the  revolution.”   POOYADAYANIM  Iranian-Jewish  Public  Affairs  Committee   And  members  of  the  community  keep  mezuzot  on  the  inside  of  their   doors  instead  of  the  outside.   What  happens  inside  those  houses  is  another  story,  however.   In  recent  years,  Jewish  practice  may  have  strengthened  in  Iran.   “Jews  in  Iran  have  become  more  religious  since  the  revolution,”  con  firmed  Pooya  Dayanim,  president  of  the  US-based  Iranian  Jewish  Public  Affairs  Committee.  He  cited  13  active   synagogues  in  the  country,  as  well  as  a  Jewish  hospital  and  a  slew  of  Jewish   schools.   Still,  practising  Judaism  under  the  current  regime  has  proved  difficult.  State  law  forces  Jewish  schools  to  remain  open  on  the  Sabbath,  and  specifies  that  Hebrew  lessons  are  not  permitted  outside  prayer  time.   Schools  are  required  to  have  Mus  lim  principals,  since  Jews  must  occupy  subordinate  positions  at  all  times,  and  prayer  books  are  printed  in  Farsi  instead  of  Hebrew,  as  a  means  of  con   trolling  what  is  studied.

The  teaching  of  Islam  is  about  moderation  -  the  middle  road"",  warned  Mohammed  Afeal  Khan,  the  first  Asian-born  Muslim  Lord  Mayor  of  Man-  chester,  during  an  appearance  last  week  before  the  Israel  Council  on  Foreign  Rela-  tions  in  Jerusalem.   Emphasising  that  point,  he  quoted  from  an  Islamic  philosopher,  who  wrote:  “The  zealots  will  enter  hell.”   A  founding  member  in  2004  of  Man-  chester’s  Muslim-Jewish  Forum,  Khan,  born  in  Pakistan,  has  spent  much  of  his  political  career  putting  out  fires  on  racial  issues  and  encouraging  inter-communal  understand-  ing  and  respect.   Invited  by  the  council  and  on  his  first  visit  to  the  Holy  Land,  Khan,  46,  barely  made  mention  of  tensions  between  Mus-  lims  and  Jews,  and  then  only  in  response  to  a  question  from  the  floor.  The  issue  between  Asians  and  Jews  is  Palestine,  he  said.   “They  feel  that  Palestine  is  not  getting  its  just  due,”  he  argued.  “But  they  under-  stand  that  the  Jewish  people  are  the  Peo-   ple  of  the  Book,  and  perhaps  closer  to  us  than  anyone  else.  That's  why  we  have  the  Muslim-Jewish  Forum,  to  see  how  close  we  are,  and  how  much  we  could  strengthen  one  another  by  having  a  better  relationship.”   Khan  also  criticised  Europe’s  attitude  to  its  Muslim  communities,  however,  saying:  “The  Islamic  contribution  to  Western  intel-  lectual  tradition  has  been  conveniently  forgotten.”   He  estimated  that  today  there  are  some  15  million  Muslims  in  Europe,  with  seven  per  cent  of  the  French  population  Muslim.  Britain  has  some  1.8  million  Muslims,  from  many  ethnic  origins,  with  77  per  cent  from  Pakistan,  India  and  Bangladesh.  Muslims  from  47  different  nationalities  have  settled  in  Britain,  Khan  said,  the  largest  from  Libya.   Despite  their  numbers,  Muslims  still  had  a  long  way  to  go  to  be  part  of  the  British  mainstream,  he  said.  Although  they  had  full  citizenship  rights  and  half  of  them  were  actually  born  in  England,  there  were  only  some  24  Muslim  city  councillors,  four  members  of  parliament  and  six  Muslims  in   the  House  of  Lords.

"  wm&amp;,   E   Lebanese,  Jewish  doctors  call  on  Howard  to  send  aid  to  Mid-East   MARK  FRANKLIN   JEWISH,  Lebanese  and  Muslim  doctors  have  called  on  Prime  Minis  ter  John  Howard  to  provide  humanitarian  and  medical  aid  to  the  victims  of  Israel’s  war  with  Hezbollah.   In  a  letter  to  Howard  last  week,  the  Australian  Christian,  Jewish  and  Muslim  Doctors  Alliance  con   demned  the  “continuing  loss  of  civilian  life;  of  children,  women  and  men  on  both  sides  of  the  Lebanese  and  Israeli  border”.   In  total,  130  doctors  signed  the   letter,  including  past  presidents  of  the  Royal  Australian  College  of  Sur  geons,  the  Australian  Medical  Asso  ciation  and  the  Royal  Australian  and  New  Zealand  College  of  Psychi   atrists.   One  of  several  Jewish  signato  ries,  Sydney  anaesthetist  Dr  Ron  Jones,  said:  “The  achievement  of  peace  transcends  politics  to  the  point  of  being  the  prime  objective.  Having  people  agree  on  a  compro  mise  is  the  secondary  objective.”   Melbourne  surgeon  Dr  Nabeel  Ibrahim,  an  Egyptian  Muslim,  launched  the  initiative.  Its  aim,  he   said,  was  to  show  the  government  that  Australians  care  deeply  about   the  humanitarian  crisis.   “We  know  the  cost  in  terms  of  human  life  and  also  we  know  the  cost  in  regard  to  what  it  takes  to  treat  and  rehabilitate  the  casualties,  the  injured  and  the  disabled,”  he  said.  “In  human  and  in  monetary  terms,  the  cost  is  astronomical.”   Another  signatory,  Dr  Hadia  Muktal,  is  a  Lebanese  Christian  who  arrived  in  Australia  in  1969  but  still   has  family  living  in  Beirut  and   southern  Lebanon.   She  told  the  AJN  that  her  aunt   died  in  the  war,  but  does  not  yet  know  how.  “It’s  very  hard  for  me,”   she  said.  “As  a  doctor  and  as  a  human  being,  I  find  war  terrorising  ...  my  cousins  who  I  spoke  to  in  Lebanon  were  terrified,  they’re  in   total  shock.”   The  doctors  had  not  received  a   response  to  the  letter  at  the  time  the  AJN  went  to  press.   Another  body,  the  Medical  Asso  ciation  for  the  Prevention  of  War,  Australia,  also  called  on  the  Federal  Government  to  help  with  the   humanitarian  crisis  earlier  this  month.

The  event,  held  at  the  University  of  Sydney  last  Sunday  night,  included  the  screening  of  Desperate  Hours,  a  documentary  about  Turkey’s  role  in  saving  Jews  from  the  Holocaust.   It  was  organised  by  the  Muslim  based  Affinity  Intercultural  Foundation  and  Jews  for  Social  Action  at  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel  (NSTE).   Sydney  Turkish  Consul-General  Nihat  Ersen  and  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  addressed  the  audience.   Alhadeff,  who  spoke  about  the  Turkish  Muslim  consul-general  who  saved  42  Jews  on  Rhodes  Island,  where  his  family  comes  from,  said:  “It  was  a  very  positive  evening  in  terms  of  bridge  building.""   He  said  if  Sheikh  Hilaly  had  been  present,  he  would  not  have  taken  part  “We  would  not  share  a  platform  with  him  because  of  his  record  of  antise  mitic  invective  and  Holocaust  denial.”   North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel’s  (NTSE's)  Rabbi  Gary  Robuck  declined   to  comment,  and  the  event's  organ  iser,  Elizabeth  Ban,  added:  ""The  func  tion  was  about  inter-faith  dialogue,  anything  else  is  immaterial.  It  was  a  non-political  event.”   NSTE's  emeritus  rabbi,  Richard  Lampert,  a  driving  force  behind  the  event,  told  the  A/A/:  ""None  of  the  other  religious  leaders  spoke.  Why  should  he  gate-crash  the  party?  The  man  is  a  persona  non  grata;  had  he  spoken,  I  would  have  gotten  up  and  walked  out”   NSW  Community  Relations  Com  mission  chair  Stepan  Kerkyasharian  said  he  had  no  knowledge  of  Sheikh  Hilaly’s  request  to  speak,  but  said  that  the  function  was  “impressive”.   “It  was  very  timely  to  show  that  basic  human  values  can  come  to  the  forefront  at  times  of  violent  conflict.  It  is  at  times  like  this  that  people  should  speak  out,  and  those  who  do  not  have  the  means,  should  have  the  courage  to  support  those  who  do  speak  out,”  he  said.   Sheikh  Hilaly’s  spokesperson,  Keysar  Trad,  said  he  had  no  knowl  edge  of  the  muft’s  request  to  speak.  “I  would  doubt  he  had  made  that  request;  he  left  the  country  for  Egypt  on  Sunday  evening,”  Trad  said.

"  I  FOILED  PLANE-BOMBING  PI  OT   British  Jews  fear  antisemitic  backlash   |  HILARY  LEILA  KRiEGER   LONDON  —  British  Jewry  is  con  cerned  that  the  uncovering  late  last  week  of  a  Muslim  extremist  plot  to  attack  planes  from  Heathrow  Airport  will  increase  animosity  towards  the  Jewish  community,  already  suffering  from  heightened  antisemitism  fol  lowing  Israel’s  attacks  on  Hezbollah.   “There’s  no  doubt  that  any  increase  in  tensions  brings  with  it  an  increase  in  pressure  against  the  Jewish  community  at  times  like  this,”  said  Mark  Gardner  of  the  Jewish  Commu  nity  Security  Trust  (CST).  “People  look  for  scapegoats.  Jews  and  Israel  come  near  the  top  of  the  list  This  will  not  help  the  situation.”   The  CST  has  recorded  a  doubling   in  antisemitic  incidents  in  Britain   since  the  fighting  in  Lebanon  began.  Gardner  said  that  it  was  advising  Jew   ish  institutions  to  stay  on  “an  unusu  ally  high  level  of  alert”  —  already  in  place  due  to  existing  al-Qaeda  and  Hezbollah  threats  -  but  that  no  activ  ities  were  being  changed  or  curtailed  due  to  the  revealed  terrorist  plot.   Immediately  after  British  police   announced  the  foiling  of  the  plot,  some  Muslim  and  left-wing  political  voices  could  be  heard  making  the  link  between  the  planned  attacks  and  what  is  happening  in  the  Middle  East,  implying  that  Israel  was  inflaming  tensions  and,  by  doing  so,  raising  the   chances  of  terror  striking  in  places  such  as  the  UK.  But  Jewish  leaders  stressed  that  these  views  were  in  the  extreme  minority.  Still,  said  Ben  Novick,  director  of  media  relations  for  the  Britain-Israel  Communica  tions  and  Research  Centre,  such  views  “feed  into  public  opinion  and  vio  lence  on  the  street”.  He  charged  that  such  connections  would  be  “wrong”  because  the  plot  had  been  planned  for  months,  while  Israel  had  only  been  fighting  in  Lebanon  for  the  past   few  weeks.   Jon  Benjamin,  chief  executive  of  the  Board  of  Deputies  of  British  Jews,  noted  that  sometimes  events  such  as  Thursday’s  reminded  Britons  of  their  shared  experience  with  Israelis  in  fac  ing  terrorism.  He  said  that  this  type  of  report,  “brings  home  to  people  how  important  the  security  situation  is”.   JERUSALEM  POST ",2006-08-18

"  Can  they  force  the  Hilaly   genie  back  into  the  bottle?   NEWS  ANALYSIS   BERNARD  FREEDMAN   FOR  the  first  time  in  almost  a  quarter  of  a  century,  Lebanese  Muslim  mem  bers  of  Sydney’s  Lakemba  Mosque  have  summoned  up  die  courage  to  tell  their  troublesome  imam,  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly,  to  shut  up.   In  the  face  of  widespread  commu  nity  and  media  outrage  at  his  most  recent  attack  on  western  women  as   “uncovered  meat”,  they  have  stopped  him  fomenting  racial  hatred  and  vio  lence  with  ranting  anti-western,  anti  semitic  sermons  in  the  mosque.   Now  the/re  doing  their  best  to  get  rid  of  him  despite  his  defiant  cries  that  they  cannot  sack  him;  but  it  won’t  be  easy  to  force  the  wicked  Hilaly  genie  back  into  the  botde.   Egyptian-born  Hilaly,  a  former  member  of  the  extremist  Muslim  Brotherhood,  originally  came  to  Aus  tralia  in  1982  on  a  temporary  entry  visa.  He  came  to  fill  a  gap  left  after  the  Lakemba  Mosque  deposed  Sheikh   Khaled  Zeidan  as  its  imam.   Almost  from  the  moment  he  arrived  at  Lakemba  with  his  wife,  Sochere,  and  two  daughters,  Shaimah  and  Assmah,  Hilaly  began  inciting  racist  hatred  and  intolerance,  preach  ing  against  American  “white  pigs”  and  the  “black  snake  of  the  Jewish  nation”  and  attacking  western  women  as  “cheap  meat”.   But  at  the  end  of  1982,  the  Depart  ment  of  Immigration  extended  his  visa  for  six  months  more,  the  first  of  a  series  of  extensions  during  which  Hilaly  fathered  two  Australian-born  children,  Fatma,  now  23,  and  Mohammed,  now  21.   The  only  Federal  Government  action  against  Hilaly  came  early  in  1986  after  the  imam,  having  repeat   edly  flouted  immigration  laws  when  his  visas  expired,  refused  to  accept   another  six-month  extension  to  his  temporary  entry  visa  and  demanded  permanent  residence.   Then  Immigration  Minister  Chris  Hurford  thought  otherwise.  Citing  Hilal/s  “deep-seated  contempt  of  basic  Australian  values  and  attitudes”  Hurford  decided  to  deport  the  imam   and  his  wife.   When  Hilal/s  supporters  chal  lenged  this  decision  before  the  full  bench  of  the  Federal  Court,  they  lost;  but  Paul  Keating,  acting  prime  minis  ter  while  Bob  Hawke  was  overseas,  urged  Mick  Young,  then  immigration  minister,  to  revoke  the  deportation   orders.   I  Keating  defended  the   decision,  saying  that   objections  to  Hilaly  had  “overtime  been  dissipated”.   The  reason?  Lakemba  Mosque’s  worshippers  inhabit  the  neighbour  ing  Sydney  electorates  then  held  by  Keating  and  prominent  Labor  right  winger  Leo  McLeay.  Both  feared  a   Muslim  voter  backlash.   In  1988,  the  Australian  Jewish  Times  revealed  to  a  shocked  Jewish  community  that  Hilaly,  speaking  at  a  University  of  Sydney  seminar,  had  attacked  Jews  as  “the  underlying  cause  of  all  wars  threatening  the  peace  and  security  of  the  whole  inhabited   earth”.   A  brief  flurry  of  publicity  and  con  demnation  from  Jewish  community  leaders  followed,  but  no  government  action.  At  the  time,  Hilaly  had  received  yet  another  extension  of  his  temporary  entry  visa  until  June  1989.   me  report  in  the  Australian  Jewish  Times  about  Sheikh  Hllafy’s   antlsemltic  speech  at  the  University  of  Sydney  on  September  18.   A  year  later,  another  Immigration  Minister,  Gerry  Hand,  amid  accusa  tions  of  secrecy,  approved  Hilal/s  application  for  permanent  residence.   Keating  defended  the  decision,  saying  that  objections  to  Hilaly  had  “over  time  been  dissipated”  and  there  was  no  reason  why  he  could  not  be  dealt  with  as  an  applicant  for  migra  tion  “given  the  fact  that  he  has  a  num  ber  of  children  bom  in  this  country  as   well”.   The  final  uncorking  of  the  Hilaly  genie  came  about  10  years  ago.  Hilaly  was  quietly  granted  Australian  citi  zenship.  Without  some  extraordinary  -  and  highly  unlikely  -  ministerial  action,  he  cannot  be  deported.  He  knows  there  is  almost  nothing  to  stop  him  saying  what  he  wants  in  Arabic,  despite  undertaking  to  learn  English  as  a  condition  of  being  granted  per  manent  residence,  and  he  has  report  edly  been  an  ardent  supporter  of  jihadists  and  terrorists  in  speeches   ever  since.   The  genie  -  currently  the  mufti  of  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  the  South   Pacific  and  the  Islamic  community's  highest  authority  on  religious  legal   matters  -  remains  out  of  the  bottle  while  more  moderate  Muslims  seek  a ",2006-11-03
"  The  streets  of  Lakemha   Most  Australian  Jews  know  that  Lakemba  is  the  epicentre  of  the   Muslim  community  in  Australia  and  the  home  of  controversial  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly.  But  how  many  have  actually  been  there?  MARK  FRANKLIN  and  JOSHUA  LEVH  trawled  the  streets.   IT’S  the  heartland  of  Muslim  Australia,  the   home  of  the  notorious  firebrand  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly  and,  according  to  police,  a  hot-spot  for  drug-related  crime.   So,  is  Lakemba,  a  mere  40  minutes’  drive  from  the  serenity  of  Bondi  Beach,  an  unsafe  place  to  walk  the  streets,  a  hotbed  of  Islamic  extremism  and  a  stomping  ground  for  gangs  of  Middle  Eastern  men?  Or  is  this  simply  an  exag  gerated  image  portrayed  by  the  media?   Is  it  the  “war  zone”  NSW  Opposition  Leader  Peter  Debnam  claims  it  is?   It’s  hard  to  imagine  that  Debnam,  the  local  member  for  Vaucluse,  which  is  home  to  a  large  number  of  Jews,  has  spent  much  time  wan  dering  the  streets  of  Lakemba.   In  fact,  it’s  safe  to  assume  most  of  Sydney’s  Jews,  and  not  just  those  from  Vaucluse,  have  never  strayed  west  of  Punchbowl.  But  Haldon  Street,  Lakemba’s  main  artery,  is  much  like   Bondi  Road.   It’s  a  crowded  strip  that  stretches  down  a  concrete  hill,  lined  with  a  smorgasbord  of  shops.  It  bristles  with  people  and  there’s  a  dis  tinct  community  atmosphere.   Folk  greet  one  another  on  the  footpath,  but  here  in  Lakemba  it’s  not  hoards  of  Israeli  back  packers,  but  Middle  Eastern  men;  it’s  not  the  scent  of  seaside  air,  but  the  aroma  of  Turkish  coffee  and  the  scent  of  herbs  and  spices  that  wafts  around  the  midday  air.   And  it’s  not  the  uber-hip  funky  fashionistas  who  parade  the  footpaths,  but  modest  women  clad  in  burqas.   Nonetheless,  there  are  clusters  of  teenage  girls  who  chat  furtively  while  punching  text  messages  on  their  mobile  phones.   But  there’s  also  clear  evidence  that  here  in  Sydney’s  west  -  half  a  world  away  from  the  conflict  in  the  Middle  East  -  Lebanon,  Hezbollah  and  Hassan  Nasrallah  are,  if  not  the  talk  of  the  town,  then  at  least  part  of  the  land   scape.   Mr  Moussa,  who  makes  a  living  importing  Arabic  clothes,  stands  patiently  at  the  entrance  to  his  shop.  He  holds  a  newspaper  that  he  bought  in  Lebanon,  the  country  of  his  birth,  two  weeks  ago.  He  was  there  on  busi  ness  when  Israel’s  war  against  Hezbollah  began.   Moussa  is  not  a  supporter  of  Hezbollah  -  in  fact,  he  seems  to  genuinely  lament  the  Israeli  victims  of  Katyusha  rockets  -  but  he  bran  dishes  the  pages  of  his  newspaper,  replete  with  images  of  dead  children,  to  demonstrate  the  travesty  he  says  Israel  is  inflicting  on  inno   cent  civilians.   “They  are  killing  good  human  beings.  The  Israeli  Army  is  not  killing  Hezbollah  and  Hezbollah  is  not  killing  the  Israeli  Army.  The  only  ones  being  killed  are  human  beings,  you  know,  the  women  and  children.”   Nazar  Khalid,  the  owner  of  a  local  fast-food  shop,  has  a  sign  on  his  window  calling  for  donations  to  help  the  Lebanese  people.   Inside,  a  woman  is  selling  raffle  tickets  for  the  same  cause,  a  campaign  which  is  being  organised  through  Lakemba  Mosque.   Ministered  by  the  rambunctious  Sheikh  Tajedin  al-Hilaly,  notorious  for  his  anti-Israel  rants,  the  mosque  is  one  of  Sydney’s  largest  and  is  home  to  a  significant  proportion  of  the  city’s  Lebanese  Muslims.   Driving  past  the  mosque  shortly  before  the  afternoon  call  to  prayers,  thick-bearded  men  clad  in  religious  garb  begin  to  converge  on  the  ornate  building.  Many  more  are  already  inside,  as  evidenced  by  the  growing  pile  of  shoes  at  the  doorway.   Driving  home  to  the  eastern  suburbs,  back  to  the  beachside  serenity  of  Bondi,  Tamarama,  Clovelly  and  Coogee,  a  fire  engine  rounds  the  comer,  its  siren  wailing.   Despite  the  hype  about  Lakemba  being  a  “war  zone”,  it’s  the  only  siren  that  screamed  at   me  all  afternoon.

"  ACCORDING  to  news  reports,  the  pro-Lebanese  rally  in  Sydney's  CBD   last  Saturday  was  among  the  largest  in  the  world,  if  not  the  largest  This  in  itself  should  be  enough  cause  for  concern  among  the  Jewish  com  munity,  which  is  less  than  one-third  the  size  of  the  Muslim  communi  ty  in  Australia.  But  it  wasn’t  just  the  sheer  numbers  that  joined  this  pro-Lebanese,  pro-Palestinian  rally.  Almost  by  default,  it  soon  became  an  anti  Israeli,  and  arguably,  anti-Jewish  demonstration.   As  reported  in  this  week’s  edition,  the  rally,  although  not  violent,  was  replete  with  banners  equating  Zionism  to  Nazism,  describing  the  crisis  in  Gaza  and  Lebanon  as  a  “new  Holocaust”,  and  worse.  And  in  case  anyone  has  any  doubts  about  the  authenticity  of  their  venom,  our  eyewitness  report  confirms  these  fears.  But  those  who  still  remain  nonchalant  about  the  need  to  be  extra  vigilant  in  these  troubled  times  should  note  two  further  developments.   First,  our  arch  nemesis,  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly,  who  was  among  the  Islamic  leaders  at  the  rally,  has  been  repeatedly  stirring  his  flock  at  his  Lakemba  mosque  with  anti-Zionist  and  antisemitic  venom.   This,  of  course,  is  the  same  Sheikh  Hilaly  who  in  2004  delivered  a  sermon  in  a  Sidon  mosque  where  he  infamously  described  9/11  as  “God’s  work  against  oppressors”,  lauded  suicide  bombers  and  said  he  “felt  proud”  of  Hezbollah’s  war  against  “the  Israeli  enemy”.   Second,  a  report  we  publish  in  this  week’s  AJN  claims  that  Hezbollah  sleep  er  cells  abroad  have  apparently  been  activated.  This  comes  on  the  back  of  our  story  last  week,  in  which  Israeli  Ambassador  Nati  Tamir  warned  that  Hezbollah  could  strike  Israeli  and  Jewish  targets  abroad,  as  they  have  allegedly  done  in  the  past,  most  notably  in  the  1994  bombing  of  the  Jewish  community  centre  in  Buenos  Aires,  in  which  85  people  were  killed.   While  we  should  not  overreact,  we  should  also  redouble  our  efforts  to  ensure  our  institutions,  our  families  and  our  community  are  safe  and  secure.  Australia  has  thus  far  been  free  of  terror.  But  only  a  fool  would  not  take  heed  of  these  warning  signals. ",2006-07-28
"  NUS  Elections  2006   Candidate  Statements   £''nor  Jean  (Against  Racism  and  War)   m  Elinor  Jean  and  I'm  standing  as  NUS  delegate.  I've  been  active  a'  year  fighting  against  the  Iraq  war,  against  anti-Muslim  racism  and  recently  against  Israel's  brutal  assault  on  Lebanon  and  Palestine.  lrn  a  member  of  Socialist  Alternative.  As  NUS  delegate,  I  will  argue  that  Nus  needs  to  lead  a  national  student  campaign  against  war  anc*  racism.  So  if  you  hate  John  Howard,  his  warmongering,  his  stacks  on  Australian  workers  and  students,  and  his  revolting  racism:  vote  Against  Racism  &amp;  War.  Or  even  better  -  talk  to  us  sbout  how  you  can  get  involved  in  fighting  back  right  here  on  Campus!   Harry  Paternoster  (Against  Racism  and  War)  ?  believe  our  Student  Association  needs  to  take  ab  leading  role  in  '9hting  racism  on  campus  and  abroad.  Howard's  racist  campaign  a9ainst  Muslims  and  Arabs,  most  recently  in  support  of  Israel's  ^^ssacres  in  Lebanon,  must  be  opposed.  As  students,  the  most  effective  way  to  do  this  is  to  make  our  National  Union  of  Students  take  a  lead  whenever  these  outrages  occur.  Of  course,  this  means  c°ntinuing  to  affiliate  to  NUS.  But  to  have  a  strong,  national  body,  ^e  need  strong  student  associations  on  every  campus  -  so  i'll  also  ke  pushing  to  get  full-funding  for  our  own  one.'  Kyla  Cassells  (Against  War  and  Racism)  ~^'he  past  year  has  shown  that  there  are  a  whole  lot  of  issues  that  M-JS  should  be  fighting  around.  There  have  been  race  riots  in  ^ronulla;  continual  fear  mongering  over  the  War  'on  Terror',  and,  °n  top  of  this,  Israeli  attacks  on  Lebanon  and  Gaza.  Students  are  ^ireclly  affected  by  the  racism  that  these  kind  of  events  create.  I'm  standing  for  NUS  delegate  because  I  think  students  need  a  Union  Committed  to  fighting  racism  and  war,  and  standing  up  to  the  Howard  government.  So  if  you're  against  racism,  and  you're  against  fear-mongering  and  war,  vote  Kyla  Cassells  for  NUS  delegate.  £oe  Speck,  Matt  Byrne,  Peter  Boyle  and  Claire  Bongiomo  (All  Left  All  Stars)  Did  you  know  that  all  delegates  to  National  Conference  sit  and  vote  With  a  national  faction?  The  Labor  Students  Club  sit  and  vote  with  a  binding  Labor  faction.  The  'Independents'  sit  with  the  small  independent  caucus  and  vote  according  to  how  they  feel  on  day.  All  Left  All  Star  candidates  are  the  only  candidates  that  sit  with  a  ncn-binding,  left-wing  caucus.  We  believe  this  is  the  best  way  to  represent  ANU  students.  As  your  national  delegates  we  promise  to  be  a  progressive  voice  at  national  conference.  And  as  we  sit  with  a  '  nan-binding  caucus,  factional  positions  won't  override  the  interests  of  ANU  students.   Unlike  some  other  tickets,  we  support  NUS  affiliation.  We  believe  that  the  ANU  Students  Association  must  remain  affiliated  to  this  peak  representative  body  to  have  ANU  students  concerns  heard  and  to  make  NUS  a  more  viable  and  representative  body.  In  past  years,  our  NUS  delegates  have  given  priority  to  environmental  and  queer  issues.  Last  year,  while  candidates  from  other  tickets  were  making  factional  deals,  we  participated  in  rural  and  regional  campus  discussions  (as  ANU  is  considered  a  regional  campus)  to  promote  .the  interests  of  ANU  students.  We  also  participated  in  VSU  planning  and  campaigning  meetings.  When  voting  for  NUS  delegates,  know  what  you  are  voting  for.  Vote  All  Left  All  Stars  for  a  progressive  voice  at  this  years  National  Conference.   Tim  Vines  (Indigo)  What  is  ANUSA  for,  but  to  represent  students  and  support  their  efforts  to  create  a  vibrant  community?  Having  experienced  both  Hall  and  off-campus  lifestyles  I  see  clubs  and  societies  as  wonderful  avenues  for  students  to  form  lasting  friendships.  It  is  important  that  these  organisations  survive.  Further,  when  problems   confront  students  it  is  crucial  that  an  independent,  committed  and  passionate  SA  is  prepared  to  lobby  to  ensure  that  student  concerns  are  addressed  within  the  University.  The  representation  and  advocacy  roles  are  what  draw  me  and  other  Indigo  candidates  to  ANUSA.  I  hope  my  experiences  can  be  of  service  to  ANUSA.   Laura  Crespo  (Indigo)  So,  I've  being  President  of  ANUSA  this  year  and  there's  always  more  to  do!  How  about  finding  some  more  inventive  methods  of  learning?  I  don't  know  about  you,  but  there's  got  to  be  more  than  the  standard  two  lecture  one  tutorial  model.  How  about  finding  a  way  to  feel  more  comfortable  in  speaking  up  in  those  dreaded  tutorials?  The   ANUSA  English  Conversational  group's  initiative  has  been  a  huge  success,  but  there's  defiantly  room  for  growth.  Most  importantly  though,  I'd  just  like  to  continue  helping  out  in  ANUSA...  you  could  help  too:  get  out  and  vote  INDiGO!

As  it  is,  Tim  not  indictable,  but  I'm  certainly  electable.  Tom  Watson  (Independent)   Many  of  you  are  probably  asking  'Why  should  I  vote  for  Zionize'  or  alternately  'Why  did  you  bomb  my  house  and  kill  my  children?'.  To  the  first  question,  well,  consider  the  fact  that  the  Indies  have  had  power  as  long  as  the  Nazi  party  did,  Right  Labor  routinely  mix  dairy  and  meat  and  the  Socialists  are  even  more  crazy  than  we  are.

John  Horan  (Independent)   People  have  underestimated  the  opportunities  our  current  war  presents  in  the  education  of  our  children.  Games  like  'Spot  the  terrorist'  are  much  easier  to  learn  when  unarmed  civilians  are  considered  fair  game.

It  takes  time  to  see  how  everything  is  run;  and  I  feel  that  I  am  now  in  a  position  to  work  for  students  even  more  effectively.  With  the  new  college  structure  having  just   come  in,  it  is  still  a  time  of  change,  and  hence  a  time  when  the  student  voice  can  have  much  influence.

I'm  running  for  science  faculty  representative  on  the  Diversify  ticket.  Though  I  have  considered  running  for  election  before,  this  is  my  first  attempt  for  two  reasons.  Firstly  the  Diversify  ticket  has  outstanding  candidates  across  the  board,  and  is  a  group  I  look  forward  to  working  with.  Secondly,  I  now  feel  I  have  the*  experience  and  ability  to  best  represent  the  interests  of  science  students  at  ANU.

Unlike  some  of  the  other  tickets,  who  are  arguing  over  who  is  the  most  'independent1,  we  are  happy  to  own  up  to  our  progressive  politics.  We  believe  the  best  way  to  represent  students  is  to  tell  them  what  they  are  voting  for.  When  you  vote  for  All  Left  All  Stars  general  representative  candidates,  you  know  exactly  what  you  are  voting  for.  All  Left  All  Stars  has  comprehensive  policy,  including  a  commitment  to  actively  oppose  further  course  cuts  and  fee  increases.  We  are  also  opposed  to  the  'rationalisation'  of  the  departments,  which  play  a  crucial  representative  role  for  many  students.  We  are  also  concerned  about  student  welfare.  The  Students  Association  must  oppose  any  further  burdening  of  students  with  the  costs  of  education.  This  includes  opposing  increased  printing  fees  and  lobbying  for  the  reinstatement  of  the  8  per  cent  textbook.  The  introduction  of  VSU  poses  an  increased  threat  to  the  welfare  of  all  students,  All  Left  All  Stars  candidates  will  continue  to  call  for  the  University  to  fully  fund  all  student  services.  Some  members  on  the  All  Stars  ticket  are  Young  Labor  Left  members,  but  we  also  have  independent  left  wing  candidates  on  our  ticket.  As  members  of  Labor  Left  we  have  been  active  on  campus  all  year,  particularly  in  talking  to  students  about  the  Governments  new  workplace  laws.  This  means  we  have  been  present  and  active  on  campus  all  year,  not  just  at  election  time  like  many  other  tickets.  All  Left  All  Stars  general  representative  candidates  have  previously  been  executive  members,  general  representatives,  faculty  representatives  and  active  departmental  members,  making  our  candidates  experienced  in  the  workings  of  the  Students  Association.  However,  we  also  have  new  people  running  to  bring  fresh  ideas  and  enthusiasm  to  the  SA.  As  in  previous  years  we  will  continue  to  fight  for  an  open  and  responsive  Students'  Association,  an   Association  which  campaigns  for  quality  education,  which  advocates  for  the  provision  of  adequate  student  welfare  and  maintains  a  strong  student  voice  at  ANU.  When  you  vote  for  All  Left  All  Stars,  you  know  what  you  are  voting  for.  Vote  All  Left  All  Stars  for  a  progressive  voice  in  your  Students'  Association.   Terri  Warner  (I  Can  See  Queerly  .Now)  Hello,  I'm  Terri,  but  my  friends  don't  call  me  Tezza.  I'm  one  of  the  disabilities  co-officers  for  2006.  Homophobia  is  lame,  ableism  is  lame,  and  don't  forget:  there's  nothing  sexier  than  consent.   Rob  Graf  (I  Can  See  Queerly  Now)   Hi!  I've  been  at  this  university  since  approximately  the  dawn  of  time,  I've  been  president  of  one  of  the  major  clubs  on  campus,  and  I'm  the  2006  sexuality  officer.  That  means  that  unlike  half  of  the  candidates  on  the  ballot,  I  already  have  a  pretty  good  idea  what  the   Students'  Association  actually  does.  It  is  vitally  important  that  the  departments  of  the  SA  survive  unharmed  under  VSU.  Clubs  and  societies  simply  can  not  fulfil  the  role  of  departments.  Please  don't  vote  for  any  ticket  who  are  going  to  slash  department  budgets  more  than  they  have  to.

I  like  Saturday  morning  cartoons,  rainbows,  lollypops,  puppies,  icecream,  kittens,  dental  dams  and  sunshine  (but  not  all  at  once).  Remember,  gay  means  happy!   David  Leighton  (I  Can  See  Queerly  Now)  Hi,  I'm  Dave  Leighton.  Apparently  I'm  president  of  Jellybabies  this  year.  Wow!  If  you  like  Pina  Coladas  and  getting  caught  in  the  rain,  if  you're  not  into  yoga  and  you  have  half  a  brain,  if  you'd   like  making  love  at  midnight  in  the  dunes  on  the  Cape,  then  I'm  the  love  that  you've  looked  for.

I'm  running   on  this  ticket  because  I  don't  want  to  see  our  vibrant  clubs  &amp;  societies  on  campus  have  their  budgets  slashed  by  more  than  75%.  I  want  to  see  experienced  and  talented  individuals  in  the  SA  -  everyday  students  with  a  real  commitment  to  independence  bringing  you  the  things  that  matter  most.  Vote  to  DIVERSIFY.   Josh  Gordon-Carr  (Diversify)  Clubs  and  Societies  funding  stands  to  be  slashed  under  this  current  SA  exec  and  this  is  completely  unacceptable.  The  present  exec  doesn't  believe  in  Clubs  and  Societies  and  has  actively  moved  to  make  them  fend  for  themselves.  DIVERSIFY   believes  in  supporting  Clubs  and  Societies  and  providing  them  the  resources  they  need  to  attract  members  and  hold  events.  After  all,  Clubs  and  Societies  are  integral  to  our  university  experience.  I  will  make  this  my  priority.  Vote  for  university  life.  Vote  for  funding  for  clubs  and  societies.  Vote  for  DIVERSIFY.   Madeline  Firth  (Diversify)  'Why  should  you  vote  for  me?'  I  think  the  more  important  question  here  is  'why  should  you  vote?'  And  the  answer,  simple.  Because  you  can!  Last  year  only  a  meagre  700  people  did,  and  we  call  ourselves  a  democracy!  So  why  vote  for  me   specifically?  Well,  why  not?  I'm  committed  to  student  interests;  have  a  generally  cheerful  disposition  and  am  very  friendly  when  drunk.  Surely  these  are  the  qualities  of  an  ideal  candidate.  So  go  on,  exercise  your  democratic  power  and  have  your  say  during  election  week.   Emma  Phillips  (Diversify)  As  a  John's  fresher,  I'm  concerned  with  assisting  students  make  the  transition  from  school  to  uni,  home  to  college,  old  friends  to  new.  ANUSA  needs  to  make  uni  life  as  easy  as  possible.  Parking  needs  fixing,  reading  brick  lines  need  shortening,  library  opening  hours  need  extending.  The   DIVERSIFY  team  recognizes  differences  and  individual  needs.  It's  a  ticket  without  the  influence  of  any  political  party,  with  the  support  of  a  range  of  groups  on  campus.  I  am  on  this  ticket  because  I  want  to  reflect  your  views,  not  the  views  of  last  year's  administration  or  a  group  of  political  hacks.   Patrick  Dennien  (Indigo)   My  name  is  Patrick  Dennien  and  I  am  running  as  a  General  Representative  on  the  *  Indigo  ticket  in  the  upcoming  ANUSA  election.  I  have  involved  myself  in  this  election  in  an  effort  to  take  part  in  policy  involving  the  student  body  and  to  play  a  role  in  making  a  positive  change   in  the  future  of  the  ANUSA.  In  short  I  am  willing  to  dedicate  as  much  time  and  effort  as  is  necessary  to  make  sure  the  job  is  done  \  in  the  best  interests  of  the  students.  !  Kenny  Tan  (Diversify)  i  |  University  life  isn't  always  easy  -  especially  for  international  f  students.  Trying  to  make  it  where  no  one  knows  you,  coming  alone,  I  ^balancing  the  workload  in  English  (often  a  strange  language)  and  making  ends  meet.  I  believe  having  a  strong  social  network  helps.  Having  someone  to  represent  you  will  facilitate  the  process,  making  the  SA  the  zenith  to  international  student  representation.  Being  a  Gen  Rep  enables  me  to  use  the  resources  of  SA  for  the  benefit  of  international  students.  This  means  more  events  are  held  for  you.  Being  ISSANU  President  taught  me:  We  Are  Who  We  Are  Represented  By.  VOTE  DIVERSIFY  Emma  Smith  (Diversify)   Like  most  students  at  ANU  I  like  having  fun.  I  believe  a  rich  social  life-  is  crucial  to  surviving  uni.  I  approach  ANUSA  fresh  and  armed  with  ideas.  I  understand  the  difficulty  of  balancing  a  social  and  academic  life  and  want  to  work  to  make  uni  life  as  exciting  as  possible.  Running  with  DIVERSIFY  allows  me  to  approach  these   objectives,  as  well  as  listen  to  students,  unrestrained,  by  a  party  line.  As  a  Gen  Rep  I'm  committed  to  YOU!  Elinor  Jean  (Against  War  and  Racism)  I'm  Elinor  Jean  and  I'm  standing  as  General  Representative.  As  a  current  General  Representative  in  the  ANU  Students  Association,  I've  been  active  arguing  for  the  Students  Association  to  fight  for  full  funding  from  the  ANU  administration  and  against  disaffiliation  from  NUS.  I  believe  that  student  activists  have  a  vital  role  to  play  in  fighting  back  against  the  Howard  government.  Vote  Against  Racism  &amp;  War  for  books  not  bombs:  To  fight  to  save  our  student  organizations,  against  anti-Muslim  and  anti-Arab  racism,  against  Australia's  involvement  in  the  wars  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan,  and  for  an  end  to  military  advertising  on  campus.  Alex  Naughton  (Diversify)  Hi  guys,  my  names  Alex  and  I  am  currently  in  my  2nd  year  of  a  science/law  degree  and  am  at  Burgmann  College.  This  year  I  organized  my  college  o-week  and  have  been  on  the  residents   association,  so  I  am  familiar  with  trying  to  satisfy  various  needs  from  students.  If  elected  as  a  general  rep,  I  would  work  strongly  towards  consistent  assessment  standards  throughout  all  faculties  as  well  as  ensuring  welfare  services  are  made  readily  available  on  campus.  If  you  want  representation  of  everyone,  then  vote  to  diversify,  vote  for  diversify  and  vote  for  me.   David  Ananian-Cooper  (Diversify)  I  believe  in  integrity,  independence  and  '  accountability.  Voting  for  DIVERSIFY  shows  that  you  value  mature  and  reliable  representation  that  allows  all  students'  opinions  to  be  aired.  As  a  student  of  science  and  law,  I  know  about  lecture  clashes,  the  problems  with  taping,.  and  the  many  pressures  students  face  in  their  academic  lives.   Only  a  non-binding  ticket  can  deliver  the  results  that  diverse  students  want.  Vote  for  the  DIVERSIFY  team  to  ensure  that  your  view  is  heard.

I  am  currently  studying  finance  and  living  at  Bruce  Hall.  I  am  running  for  ANUSA  because  I  ?  feel  the  current  ANUSA  needs  to  get  over  the  whole  VSU  debacle  and  work  towards  making  the  most  of  the  funds  that  it  is  given.  I  also  feel  very  strongly  that  ANUSA  needs  to  be  more  particular  with  what  protests  and  activities  it  endorses  with  activities  like  Flag  Burning  being  high  on  the  list  of  things  to  stop.  If  you  agree,  vote  1  me!!!  :D   Dom  Delaney  (Indigo)  Hi  guys,  my  name's  Dom  Delany,  I'm  a  second  year  law/asian  studies  student  and  I  live  at  Burton  and  Garran  Hall.  I'm  running  for  a  gen  rep  position  with  Indigo  because  I  believe  that  ANUSA  is  a  really  important  organisation,  placed  in  a  unique  position  to  represent  students.  Now  that  VSU  has  arrived,  I  believe  that  ANUSA's  job   is  more  important  than  ever,  and,  if  elected,  I  would  focus  mainly  upon  increased  understanding  between  international  and  domestic  students,  as  well  as  student  representation  in  relation  to  various  faculties.  Hope  to  see  you  on  the  campaign.  Harry  Paternoster  (Against  Racism  and  War)  'I  believe  our  Student  Association  needs  to  take  ab  leading  role  in  fighting  racism  on  campus  and  abroad.  Howard's  racist  campaign  against  Muslims  and  Arabs,  most  recently  in  support  of  Israel's  massacres  in  Lebanon,  must  be  opposed.  As  students,  the  most  effective  way  to  do  this  is  to  make  our  National  Union  of  Students  take  a  lead  whenever  these  outrages  occur.  Of  course,  this  means  continuing  to  affiliate  to  NUS.  But  to  have  a  strong,  national  body,  we  need  strong  student  associations  on  every  campus  -  so  i'll  also  be  pushing  to  get  full-funding  for  our  own  one.1   Sarah  Lynch  (Diversify)  I  am  running  on  this  ticket  because  I  believe  in  true  independence.  I  want  to  directly  represent  my  peers.  That's  why  I  ran  on  Synergize  last  year  and  why  I  am  running  on  DIVERSIFY  this  year  -  a  non-binding  ticket  of  diverse  people  chosen  because  of  merit,  not   politics.  Our  ticket's  strength  has  meant  that  we  are  being  supported  by  four  diverse  campus  groups.  ANUSA  needs  innovative,  committed  and  independent  representatives  -  all  qualities  I  possess.  To  confront  VSU  next  year  ANUSA  needs  experienced  people  with  fresh  and  varied  ideas;  people  from  a  wide  range  of  backgrounds  -DIVERSIFY!  Kyla  Cassells  (Againsts  Racism  and  War)  There's  much  about  the  students'  association  that  has  lacked  lustre,  but  that  doesn't  mean  it  lacks  potential.  As  a  General  Representative  candidate,  I  stand  for  a  students'  association  that  is  strong  and  fighting.  We  need  to  get  rid  of  the  idea  that  the  VC  is  our  'best  friend'.  The  students'  association  must  demand  full  funding,  but  also  political  autonomy.  I  am  in  favour  of  NUS  affiliation;  against  military  advertising  on  campus,  and  I  think  the  students'  association  needs  to  be  active  fighting  racism  and  war.  So  if  you  want  a  fighting  students'  association,  vote  Kyla  Cassells  for  General  Representative.  Alex  Rafaiowicz  (Diversify)   Elections  are  frustrating  but  they're  also  the  best  way  to  fix  your  campus.  I  am  running  with  DIVERSIFY  as  an  approachable  and  articulate  3rd  year  student.  I  am  an  experienced  representative  who  will  ensure  that  the  ANU  is  not  just  the  best  learning  institution  in  Australia  but  also  the  best  teaching  institution  in  the   country.  This  means  having  an  education  department  focused  on  advocating  student-specific  issues.  Campus  culture  is  important  too,  even  in  a  VSU  environment,  I  want  to  keep  clubs  and  societies  strong.  Elect  fresh  people  with  new  ideas  and  a  range  of  passions.  Vote  to  DIVERSIFY  your  SA.  Hannah  McCann  (Diversify)  I'm  Hannah  (it's  so  easy  to  remember  you  can  even  spell  it  backwards),  and  I'm  running  as  a  gen  rep  for  Diversify  this  year.  Should  I  be  elected,  I  will  be  dedicated  to  improving  many  areas  of  student  life,  namely  student  welfare  services.  Napoleon  once  said,  'Ability  is  of  little  account  without  opportunity',  and  I  hope  that's  what  you'll  give  me  -  the  opportunity  to  represent  you  (but  unlike  Napoleon,  I  promise  not  to  invade  Russia).  Andy  Hargraves  (Diversify)  Being  a  representative  also  involves  leading  by  example.  It  is  about  team  spirit  and  university  community.  It  is  for  these  reasons  that  as  President  of  Bruce  Hall,  I  ran  the  IB.  I  have  extensive  '.experience  as  a  student  representative,  a  good  relationship  with   those  around  me,  and  an  excellent  understanding  of  students'  '  DIVERSE  needs.  I  believe  in  independent  and  accountable  student  representation.  ANUSA  needs  capable  and  approachable  students  at  its  helm.  That  is  why  I  am  RUNNING!   Sebastian  Mcintosh  (Indigo)  I  do  not  claim  to  have  any  hard  and  fast  rules  that  will  prescribe  my  actions  as  a  general  representative,  except  to  say  I  will  be  truthful  and  responsible.  I  will  do  what  I  think  is  right  for  the  student  body,  beginning  by  seeking  to  make   lecturers  more  accountable  for  their  own  poor  quality  or  ill  performance.  I  will  also  provide  a  voice  for  those  who  feel  threatened,  alienated  or  even  repulsed  by  student  politics,  because  frankly,  so  do  I.  .  ?  Neal  Fielding  (Mosaic)  Hi  my  name  is  Neal  Fielding  and  I'm  running  for  a  General  Rep  position  in  the  Students  Association.  I  am  running  the  Mosaic  campaign  and  if  elected  I  will  always  be  contactable  for  any  student  wishing  to  make  a  contribution.  Mosaic  was  established  to  provide  undergraduate  students  a  sensible  and  accountable  voice  in  the  Students  Association.  It  is  a  fact  that  the  SA  will  suffer  a  reduction  in  funding  under  VSU  and  Mosaic  will  be  committed  to  advocating  sensible  policies  that  ensure  as  many  relevant  services  are  retained  as  possible.   Ben  Pynt  (Diversify)  So  why  should  you  vote  for  me  as  gen  rep?  Well  first  of  all,  I  am  that  virile  Member  of  Parliament  Tony  Abbott's  son.  So  I  believed  for  a  while,  anyway.  So  what  should  a  shit-hot  gen  rep  be  gunning  for?  Not  only  an  easier  go  for  you  guys  as  far  as  appeals  processes  go,  but  also   ensuring  access  to  lectures  (and  their  tapes)  is  made  easier  and  finally  making  sure  that  the  average  student  knows  that  the  SA  is  there  for  them.  So  even  though  I  am  not  really  Tony  Abbott's  son  (devastatingly),  I  think  I  would  make  a  kickarse  general  representative  who  could  actually  do  something  for  you.  So  (excuse  the  cliche)  vote  for  me!  Henry  Pilcher  (Diversify)  Hey,  I'm  Henry  Pilcher,  I'm  a  third  year  fine  arts  students  living  at  Burgmann  College.  I  am  involved  in  the  Darts  team  and  have  an  understanding  of  clubs  and  societies  within  the  ANU.  If  elected,  I'd  work  for  their  continued  full-funding  under  VSU.  I've  also  really  enjoyed  living  on  campus  and  would  be  honoured  to  provide  a  voice  for  the  Halls  and  Colleges  on  the  Students  Association.  Andrea  Kirwin  (Indigo)  I  would  like  to  be  a  General  member  of  the  SA  for  the  following  reasons:  I  Generally  attend  uni.  I  Generally  enjoy  playing  sport,  making  music,  doin  art  and  kissing  girls.  I  am  Generally  a  happy  cat.  Vote  for  Andi  ey-  your  mum  knows  where  it's  at. ",2006-08-01
"  From  Darfur  to  jail   TEL  AVIV  -  Musa  Suleiman,  a  17-year-old  Sudanese  Muslim  youth  who  lost  his  whole  family  in  the  Darfur  fighting,  waits  for  the  United  Nations  to  decide  on  his  refugee  status  while  incarcerated  at  Ma'asiyahu  Prison  in  the  central  Israeli  town  of  Ramie.  Roughly  160  Sudanese  who  fled  the  fighting  in  the  Darfur  region  have  made  their  way  from  Sudan,  through  Egypt  and  the  Sinai  Desert  before  seeking  refugee  status  in  Israel.  Some  have  been  waiting  for  a  decision  for  more  than  a   year.   The  Israeli  High  Court  of  Justice  this  week  gave  the  state  30  days  to  propose  a  new  policy  to  deal  with  the  Sudanese  refugees  who  are  currently  imprisoned.  The  new  policy  must  allow  for  a  form  of  judicial  review  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Once  the  state  comes  up  with  an  alternative  scheme,  the  High  Court  will  most  likely  schedule  a  second  hearing  on  the  matter.  Until  then,  at  least,  the  refugees  will   remain  in  prison.   JTA ",2006-05-12
"  ISRAEL  AT  WR   Despite  doomsayers,  inter-faith  goes  on   AW  STAFF   A  MEETING  between  Sydney  Jewish  communal  leaders  and  a  visiting  American  imam  is  proof  that  despite  some  Mus  lim  leaders’  public  show  of  support  for  Hezbollah  last  week,  dialogue  can  continue,  even  in  times  of  great  strain,  inter-faith  activist  Jeremy   Jones  said  this  week.   Jones,  who  is  director  of  international  and  community  affairs  at  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council,  said  that  during  the  visit  of  Imam  Yahya  Hendi,  he  chaired  a  dis  cussion  on  the  importance  of  dialogue  during  times  of  polit  ical  turmoil,  which  involved  graduates  and  mentors  from  the  Journey  of  Promise  Inter  faith  program,  Muslim  schol  ars,  representatives  of  the  Women’s  Interfaith  Network  and  the  National  Council  of  Churches  in  Australia.   “The  discussion,  while  informal,  was  extremely  con  structive,”  Jones  said.  “Imam  Hendi  is  a  passionate  propo  nent  of  dialogue  and,  while  in  Australia  he  encouraged  Mus   lims  to  embrace  values  of  inclusiveness  and  tolerance.”   During  his  visit,  Imam  Hendi,  a  chaplain  and  lecturer  at  Georgetown  University  in  Washington,  DC,  also  visited  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum.   In  the  NSW  Central  Coast  town  of  Gosford,  more  than  300  people  attended  an  inter  faith  seminar  and  exhibition  last  Sunday,  which  was  co  hosted  by  the  local  Jewish,  Christian  and  Muslim  com  munities  as  part  of  the  Project   Abraham  initiative.

Meanwhile,  left-wing  group  Jewish  Voices  for  Peace  and  Justice,  convened  by  Syd  ney  writer  Donna  Jacobs  Sife,  has  co-signed  a  statement  with  pro-Palestinian  and  Lebanese  groups  urging  Israel  “to  ease  the  harsh  conditions  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza”.   However,  the  statement  did  not  criticise  the  actions  of  Hamas,  Hezbollah  or  Lebanon   in  the  current  conflict   Last  week,  New  Zealand’s  Jewish  and  Muslim  communi  ties  issued  a  joint  statement  calling  for  harmony  in  the  wake  of  attacks  on  a  local  syn  agogue  and  mosque.   The  statement  from  the  New  Zealand  Jewish  Council  and  the  Federation  of  Islamic  Associations  of  New  Zealand  said:  “New  Zealand  Muslims   and  Jews  stand  together  against  racism  and  vandalism.  We  are  all  dismayed  by  the  current  turmoil  in  the  Middle  East,  but  we  pray  and  work  for  a  lasting  peace  daily.   “The  vandals  and  bigots  are  a  tiny  but  vocal  minority,  and  we  know  that  our  many  friends   are  ashamed  of  such  acts  occurring  in  New  Zealand.”   Last  week,  Victorian  Mus  lim  leader  Sheikh  Fehmi  Naji   El-imam  and  former  Islamic   Council  of  Victoria  president   Yasser  Soliman  came  under  fire  from  Jewish  leaders  for  allegedly  praising  Hezbollah  “freedom  fighters”  at  a  pro  Lebanese  rally  in  Melbourne.

"  WAIT  FOR  DEMOCRACY   PRESIDENT  George  W  Bush’s  call  for  Arab,  Middle-Eastern  countries  to  democratise  and  rid  themselves  of  tyrannical  regimes  after  the  liberation  of  Iraq  might  seem  to  be  a  propitious  notion  for  Israel  but  could  be  just  utopian  in  its  outlook.   As  was  witnessed  in  Algeria,  and  to  some  degree  Turkey,  with  democratic  elections  in  some  Muslim  countries,   there  is  a  strong  possibility  that  the  undercurrent  of  resentment  felt  by  the  Muslim  masses  will  bring  to  power  hardline,  fanatical-Muslim  political  parties  hell  bent  on  turning  their   “One  of  the  saddest  things  these  days  is  the  number  of  Jews  who  hide  their  faith  in  so  many   different  ways.”   J  APTERMAN   countries  into  Muslim  republics  like   Iran.

And  if  Egypt  ever  held  a  truly  free  election  without  government  intervention,  would  we  see  the  once  outlawed  Muslim  Brotherhood  mak-   ing  a  political  comeback  that  would  pose  a  real  threat  to  Egypt’s  fragile  peace  with  Israel?   The  Weimar  Republic  of  Germany  of  the  late  1920s  and  early  ’30s  was  free  and  democratic  -  but  the  German   people  voted  for  an  evil  and  despica-  ble  regime  led  by  history’s  worst  mass  murderer,  Adolph  Hitler.   Before  Arab  governments  hold  democratic  general  elections,  there  must  be  a  change  in  their  constitution  that  separates  church  from  the  state.  There  has  to  be  a  secular  state  with  the   rule  of  law  and  human  rights  being   written  in  its  constitution.  These   changes  cannot  be  imposed  from  any  outside  powers;  the  Arab  masses  must  decide  if  they  want  to  live  like  most  of   the  civilised  world.   Then  and  only  then,  we  can  believe  in  truly  democratic  and  free  elections   in  the  Arab  world  without  the  omi-   nous  Muslim  fanatical  parties  hijack-  ing  the  elections.

"  Prayers  answered  at  Williams   RAAF  Base  Williams  has  sent  a  powerful  message  of  support  to  its  diverse  population  with  the  long-awaited  opening  of  the  base's  Muslim  Prayer  Room  last  month.   According  to  Defence  International  Training  Centre  (DITC)  Executive  Officer/Support  Flight  Commander,  SQNLDR  Peter  Vinnic-Clark,  the  base  plays  host  to  a  large  number  of  Muslim  believers.  ""In  addition  to  a  number  of  staff  from  across  the  base,  DITC  trains  dozens  of  Muslim  students  among  the  700  students  from  40  countries  that  it  trains  annually,""  he  said.  ""The  opening  of  this  dedicated  facility  sends  a  strong  signal  that  the  ADF  is  serious  about  its  obligations  to  its  diverse  workforce  and  that  we  genuinely  try  to  meet  people's  cul  tural  and  religious  needs.""  RAAF  Base  Williams  had  been  without  a  prayer  room  since  the  clo  sure  of  the  old  Chaplaincy  Centre  in  2005,  so  the  refurbishment  of  this  surplus  building  has  been  much  anticipated.  The  Muslim  Prayer  Room  has  been  outfitted  with  a  large  room  for  prayers  and  other  services  and  a  smaller  room  with  dedicated  facili  ties  for  the  necessary  ablutions  com  pleted  before  prayer.  SQNLDR  Vinnic-Clark  said  feedback  from  staff  and  students  has  been  very  positive.  ""The  feed  back  we  received  when  it  was  just   a  proposal  was  extremely  good  and,  now  that  it  is  open  and  in  use,  eve  ryone  is  delighted,""  he  said.  Officer  Commanding  Ground  Training  Wing,  GPCAPT  Robert  Cooper,  officially  opened  the  new  facility,  assisted  by  Indonesian  Army  Captain  Ro'is  Nahrudin,  who  was  involved  in  the  development   of  the  project.  Local  Muslim  cleric  Sheikh  Caesse  was  an  integral  part  of  the  ceremony,  reciting  a  prayer  from  the  Qur'an.

"  RECOGNISE  THE  DEFICIENCY   WITH  respect  to  your  editorial  (AJN  (7/9):  I  wish  to  take  you  up  on  your  premise  that  communication  with  “moderate”  Muslims  can  set  the  tone  for  peaceful  coexistence  and  mutual  respect  between  Muslim  communities  and  non-Muslim  ones.   There  is  a  fundamental  difference  in  outlook  between  Judaism  and  Christianity  on  the  one  hand,  and  Islam  on  the  other.  In  the  former,  there  can  be  mutual  respect  and  recognition  of  an  outsider  without  compromising  one’s  beliefs;  in  the  lat  ter,  the  basic  beliefs  preclude  this.  In  order  for  a  Muslim  to  be  truly  a  mod  erate,  liberalised,  western-minded  individual,  they  must  subvert  their   beliefs  since  Islam  does  not  afford  full  recognition  to  the  non-believer.   If  a  Muslim  is  to  be  true  to  his  cul   ture  and  heritage  and  at  the  same  time   assume  moderation  in  his  relations   with  the  outside  world,  s/he  is  likely  to  have  to  adopt  a  schizophrenic  per  sona.  The  only  real  way  forward  is  for  the  Islamic  clergy  to  recognise  this  deficiency  and  put  their  heads  togeth  er  to  actively  do  something  about  it.

"  US  HOLOCAUST  MUSEUM  SLAMMED   NATHAN  GUTTMAN   WASHINGTON  -  A  group  of  Ameri-  can  Jewish  activists  has  launched  a  campaign  aimed  at  getting  the  US   Holocaust  Memorial  Museum  to   recognise  the  antisemitic  actions  by  Arab  and  Muslim  leaders  during  World  War  II  and  to  take  a  leading  role  in  fighting  antisemitism  in  the  Arab   world.   The  group,  “Holocaust  Museum  Watch”,  points  to  the  feet  that  the  museum,  funded  by  the  US  Govern-  ment,  has  never  presented  an  exhibit  or  sponsored  an  event  dealing  with   Muslim  antisemitism  or  with  the  fete  of  the  Jews  in  Arab  countries  during   the  Holocaust   “The  absence  of  these  programs  is  a  failure  of  the  museum  and  an  obscene   dereliction  of  its  ways,”  said  chair-   woman  Carol  Greenwald.   The  demand  of  the  activists  is  focused  on  three  issues:  the  coopera-  tion  of  Jerusalem’s  grand  mufti,  Haj  Amin  al-Husseini,  with  the  Nazi   The  Hall  of  Witness  at  the  US  Holocaust  Memorial  Museum.

The  group  is  trying  to  get  the  museum,  part  of  whose  mission  is  to  fight  hate  and  genocide,  to  speak  out  against  modern  Arab  and  Muslim  antisemitism,  specifically  the  latest   remarks  of  Iranian  President  Mah-   moud  Ahmadinejad  calling  for  the   destruction  of  the  State  of  Israel.

"  A  different  approach   IT  is  true,  unfortunately,  that  an  overwhelming  majority  of  terrorists  are   Muslims.  The  inverse,  of  course  -  that  an  overwhelming  majority  of  Mus  lims  are  terrorists  -  is  an  absolute  fallacy.   Thus,  while  one  can  appreciate  the  concern  that  security  agencies  have  about  Muslim  communities  harbouring  potential  terrorist  cells,  any  singling  out  of  Muslims  as  such,  and  any  call  for  Muslims  to  combat  terrorism  by  abandoning  their  religion,  culture  or  heritage,  is  inherently  counterproduc  tive.  It  can  only  foster  collective  resentment  that  acts  as  a  breeding  ground  for   would-be  terrorists.   Thus,  we  concur  with  Jewish  officials  who  this  week  expressed  unease  about  statements  made  by  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  that  publicly  casti  gate  the  Muslim  community  and  urge  it  to  integrate.  Jews,  more  than  others,  should  instinctively  wince  when  an  elected  leader  singles  out  a  distinct  minor  ity  for  criticism.   The  Australian  Muslim  community  indeed  harbours  troubling  pockets  of  extremism,  and  its  leadership  has  often  disappointed  by  adopting  the  most  harsh  anti-Israeli  rhetoric  and  failing  to  speak  out  unequivocally  against  ter   ror.   Nonetheless,  and  until  proven  otherwise,  the  overwhelming  majority  of  the  390,000  Australian  Muslims  should  be  viewed  as  loyal  and  hard-working,  and  are  highly  appreciative  of  their  chance  to  build  a  new  life  in  the  “lucky  country”.  We  therefore  concur  with  their  call  for  politicians  to  cease  playing  to  the  populist  political  gallery  and  to  desist  from  ostracising  the  entire  Muslim  community.  The  War  on  Terror  requires  not  only  guns,  ammunition  and  counter-terror  measures,  but  wise  counsel,  calm  heads  and  cooler  rhetoric  as  well. ",2006-09-08
"  Hamas:  a  beginner’s  guide   JTA  STAFF   HAMAS,  which  will  form  the  next  Palestinian  Authority  Government,  has  an  ideology  that  is  based  on  the  destruction  of  Israel  through  jihad,  or  Muslim  “holy  war”.  The  group’s  1988  charter  states:  “Israel  will  exist  and  will  continue  to  exist  until  Islam  will  oblit  erate  it,  just  as  it  obliterated  others   before  it.”   The  charter  adds  that  the  territory   of  Israel  is  “Islamic  Waqf  ’  -  that  is  part  of  the  Muslim  religious  trust,  which  cannot  be  given  to  non-Muslims  -  and  that  “the  law  governing  the  land  of  Palestine  is  the  Islamic  Sharia”,  or  Mus  lim  law.   Hamas  has  its  origins  in  the  Mus  lim  Brotherhood,  a  fundamentalist  Muslim  group  founded  in  Egypt  in  the  first  half  of  the  20th  century.  The  brotherhood  inspired  Hamas  founder   Sheikh  Ahmed  Yassin’s  notion  that  Israel  is  Islamic  land  whose  ownership  is  not  negotiable.   Sheikh  Yassin  founded  the  Islamic  Centre  in  the  Gaza  Strip  in  the  1970s,  turning  it  into  a  major  religious  organ  isation  and  laying  the  groundwork  for  a  network  of  social  and  welfare  institu  tions  that  increased  the  movement’s  popularity.  He  continued  to  absorb  the   violent  and  nationalist  ideas  of  the  Muslim  Brotherhood,  and  gradually  shifted  the  group’s  focus  from  welfare  to  violence.  That  paved  the  way  for  the  founding  of  Hamas  —  which  means  “zeal”  in  Arabic,  and  is  an  acronym  for  the  Islamic  Resistance  Movement  -  after  the  first  intifada  began  in  1987.   One  of  the  most  formative  experi  ences  for  Hamas  was  the  deportation  of  400  of  its  activists  to  Lebanon  in  1992  by  then  prime  minister  Yitzhak  Rabin.  The  move  gained  Hamas  inter  national  exposure  and  enormous  pop  ularity  in  the  territories.   Hamas  began  using  suicide  bombers  as  a  weapon  in  1994  and  since  has  carried  out  at  least  60  such  attacks;  many  more  have  been  stopped  by  Israeli  security  forces.  The  group  began  launching  rockets  at  Israeli  tar  gets  in  2001,  using  crude  Kassam  rock  ets  to  shell  Israeli  towns  in  the  Negev,  notably  Sderot.   The  group’s  attacks  have  killed  hundreds  of  Israeli  civilians  in  the  past  five  years  alone,  prompting  Israeli  legal  and  military  responses.

Photo:  JTA   States,  Australia  and  the  European  Union  consider  Hamas  a  terrorist   organisation.  During  the  second  intifada,  the  Israel  Defence  Forces  began  targeting  Hamas  leaders  for   assassination.  Sheikh  Yassin  was  killed  in  March  2004  by  an  Israeli  helicopter  gunship.  Abdel  Aziz  Rantissi,  who  was  appointed  Hamas  head  in  Yassin’s  place,  was  assassinated  a  month  later.   The  group’s  popularity  is  partly   based  on  its  social-service  worK.   Hamas  funds  educational,  medical  and  welfare  programs,  though  the  group  is  accused  of  using  the  educa  tional  program  to  spread  anti-Israel  and  extremist  Islamic  propaganda  to  children.

Firstly  and  most  importantly,  the  forum  was  held  on  a  Friday,  a  day  in  which  Jewish  schools  finish  earlier  in  preparation  for  Shabbat,  so  the  momentous  task  of  organising  bus  loads  of  kids  to  schlep  up  the  road  would  be  a  disaster,  given  the  time   frame.   Secondly,  Jewish  schools  -  especially  Moriah  College  as  evidenced  by  the  front  cover  of  the  AJN  on  November  10  -  constantly  meet  with  Muslim  stu  dents  and  hold  interaction  gatherings  whereby  Jewish  kids  and  Muslim  stu  dents  just  sit  and  talk  to  one  another,  breaking  down  barriers.   So  for  George  Newhouse  to  cast  a  wide  net  that  envelops  all  and  sundry  is  really  not  justified,  because,  even   I  after  all  the  insults  and  antisemitic  ||  barbs  hurled  against  the  Jewish  com  4l  mumty  in  Sydney  by  the  controversial  |  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly  of  Lakemba   Mosque  over  the  last  20  years,  our  yl  schools  have  tried  to  bridge  the  gap  p;  between  Jewish  and  Muslim  teenagers,  p  I  believe  the  Jewish  schools  and  |  especially  the  students  should  receive  |  an  unconditional  apology  from  $  Newhouse  for  his  slanderous  remarks.

"  Jews  accuse  PM  of  alienating   Aussie  Muslims   MARK  FRANKLIN   SENIOR  Jewish  figures  have  accused  the  Howard  Government  of  alienat  ing  Australia’s  Islamic  community  by  urging  Muslims  to  integrate  more  speedily  into  Australian  society.   Rabbi  Jeremy  Lawrence,  of  Syd  ney’s  Great  Synagogue,  told  the  AJN  this  week;  “It’s  not  helpful  to  make  public  remarks  suggesting  deficiencies  in  the  integration  of  a  community.   “It  is  important  that  faith  groups  and  ethnic  minorities  feel  _   they  are  able  to  remain  true  to  their  cultures  and  traditions  within  the  society  in  which  they  have  chosen  to  live”   Members  of  the  Jewish  commu  nity  urged  caution  and  sensitivity  after  after  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  accused  a  “small  section  of  the  Islamic   population”  of  demonstrating  an  unwillingness  to  integrate.   Howard  said  integration  included  “speaking  English  as  quickly  as  possi  ble”  and  “embracing  Australian  val  ues”,  which  he  said  required  “women  to  be  treated  fairly  and  equally”.   Earlier  this  week,  Treasurer  Peter  Costello  also  weighed  into  the  debate,  calling  on  Muslim  leaders  to  take  greater  steps  to  renounce  terrorism.   However,  Australian  Muslim  lead  ers  have  lashed  out  at  the  government,  calling  the  PM’s  remarks  “offensive”.   B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commission  chairman  Dr  Paul  Gard  ner  criticised  the  government  for  sin   gling  out  the  Islamic  community.  “The  same  certainly  applies  to  immigrants  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  or  from  Indonesia,  for  example,”  he  said.   Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  director  of  community  and  international  affairs  Jeremy  Jones  said  Islamic  integration  is  important  for  a  harmonious  society,  but  that  the  gov  ernment  should  take  steps  to  assist  by  providing  educational  programs.  “Politicians  and  media  need  to  be  aware  that  if  the  debate  is  not  clearly   structured  in  now  everyoody   can  feel  better  engaged  with  each  other...  then  we  run  the  risk  that  bigots  and  those   who  seek  to  do  damage  to  Australian   social  harmony  will  feel  empowered.”   But  Executive  Council  of  Aus   tralian  Jewry  president  Grahame  Leonard  said:  “In  principle  [Howard]  is  correct  and  it  applies  to  all  new  immigrants  to  Australia.  But  we  need  to  understand  that  it  often  takes  a  gen  eration  or  more  for  effective  integra  tion  to  happen  ”   Last  month,  the  Muslim  commu  nity  criticised  the  government  for  its  support  of  Israel  in  the  war  in  Lebanon.  Earlier  this  year,  Costello  angered  Muslims  when  he  said  there  was  no  place  in  Australia  for  tradi  tional  Muslim  (sharia)  law.

"  GREATEST  FRIEND   ONCE  again  our  PM,  John  Howard,  along  with  Alexander  Downer  and  Peter  Costello,  have  shown  that  it  is  actions  and  not  rhetoric  that  counts  when  it  comes  to  supporting  Israel  -  regardless  if  it  means  losing  votes  from  the  Aus  tralian  Muslim/Arab  community  and   their  supporters,  who  are  far  more  numerous  than  the  pro-Zionist  Jews.   The  latest  Arab/Muslim-backed  UN  resolution  against  Israel’s  offensive  in  Gaza  was  opposed  by  Australia,  the   USA  and  Micronesia  because  the  reso  lution  was  so  one-sided.   The  previous  Arab/Muslim  backed,  one-sided  UN  resolution  against  Israel’s  defensive  wall  was  also  opposed  by  Australia,  the  USA  and  Micronesia  —  and  this  was  criticised  by  Kevin  Rudd  who,  when  asked  how  Labor  would  have  voted,  stated  that  Labor  would  have  abstained.

"  Indonesian  tennis  to  Israel   AJN  STAFF   JAKARTA  -  Indonesia’s  Fed  Cup  team  has  been  given  the  government  go-ahead  to  play  in  Israel,  despite  an  absence  of  diplo  matic  ties  between  the  two  countries.   Leading  women  tennis  players  from  Indonesia,  the  world’s  most  populous  Muslim  nation,  will  clash  with  their  Israeli  counterparts  in  a  world  group  II  playoff  over  July  15-16.   “The  match  is  organised  by  the  Inter  national  Tennis  Federation.  It  has  nothing  to  do  with  political  issues  and  bilateral   relations  between  Indonesia  and  Israel,  therefore  the  team  can  go  to  Israel,”  foreign  ministry  spokesman  Desra  Percaya  said.   The  Indonesian  tennis  federation  had  previously  asked  to  change  the  venue  but  Israeli  officials  said  they  would  not  agree  to  moving  it  outside  Israel  and  that  sport  and  politics  should  not  be  mixed.   Indonesia  is  a  staunch  supporter  of  Palestinian  sovereignty  and  a  critic  of  Israel.

"  NOTHING  WRONG   WHAT  is  not  helpful  is  that  sanctimo  nious  Jews  attack  PM  John  Howard  on  an  issue  on  which  he  has  the  support  of  a  vast  majority  of  Australians  including,  I  would  suggest,  the  vast  majority  of  the  Jewish  community  in   Australia.   As  Laurie  Oakes,  the  veteran  jour  nalist  and  greatly  respected  political   columnist  stated  in  his  recent  column   in  the  Bulletin,  Howard  did  nothing  more  than  state  the  bleeding  obvious   about  a  small  section  of  the  Muslim   community  in  Australia  that  is  very  resistant  to  integration.   Howard  called  on  that  small  sec  tion  of  the  Australian  Muslim  com  munity  to  adopt  Australian  values  and  learn  English.  I  can’t  see  anything  wrong  with  that  I  am  one  Australian  Jew  who  fully  supports  John  Howard   on  this  issue!

"  Downer:  most  Muslims   do  not  support  terrorism   GEDALIAH  AFTERMAN   THE  majority  of  Australian  Muslims  do  not  support  terrorism,  Foreign   Minister  Alexander  Downer  said  this  week.   “Most  Australian  Muslims  do  not  have  sympathy  for  terrorism  or  ter  rorist  acts,”  Downer  told  the  Menzies  Research  Centre  in  Canberra  on  Tuesday.   “It  is  very  important  to  differenti  ate  between  people  who  happen  to  be  Muslim  who  support  terrorism  and  the  vast  majority  of  people  who  are  Muslim  who  abhor  terrorism.”   On  an  international  level,  Downer  called  on  states  that  sponsor  terrorism,  such  as  Iran  and  Syria,  to  “use  their  influence  to  stop  terrorist  activities  in  the  region  including  those  directed  at  the  state  of  Israel”   In  a  wide-ranging  address  titled  “Terrorism:  meeting  the  ideological  challenge”,  Downer  said  the  war  on  terror  would  be  a  “long  struggle”.   “The  terrorists  are  adapting  then  tactics  in  response  to  our  efforts.  Their  cells  are  becoming  smaller,   more  autonomous  and  more  difficult   to  detect,”  he  said.  “Despite  their  war  on  modernity,  they  increasingly  rely  on  digital  communications,  the   media  and  the  internet  for  recruit  ment,  operations  and  to  spread  their  message.”   Warning  that  any  premature  with  drawal  of  foreign  troops  from  Iraq  would  produce  consequences  that  “would  be  felt  everywhere”,  Downer  said  the  West  must  remain  “clear  eyed”  in  its  war  against  the  ideology  that  motivates  al-Qaeda  and  other  extremist  groups,  which  he  argued  is  more  political  than  religious.   “[Islamism]  seeks  to  intimidate  and  eliminate  those  who  refuse  to  submit  According  to  this  mind-set  the  personal  liberties  and  pluralism  that  characterises  the  western  way  of  life,  including  the  freedoms  enjoyed  by  women,  constitute  a  mortal  threat  to  a  ‘true’  Islamic  society.”   Downer  said  that  while  the  West  should  strengthen  the  moderates  in  the  Muslim  world  and  advance  democracy,  it  will  ultimately  be  Mus  lims  “who  reject  violence  and  extrem  ism  who  will  win  over  the  minority  who  might  be  susceptible  to  the  jihadist  cause”.

"  MIXED  MESSAGES   B’NAI  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Com  mission  chairman  Dr  Paul  Gardner  ridiculed  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  because,  Dr  Gardner  alleged,  Howard  had  suggested  that  if  people  learned  English,  they  would  be  less  inclined  to  commit  terrorism  (“Zion  ists  rally  behind  Howard  over  Muslim  integration”,  AJN15/9).   However,  that  is  not  what  Howard  said.  In  answering  a  talk-back  caller  who  expressed  concern  about  immi  grants  who  “aren’t  fitting  in  very  well”,  Howard  responded  that  people  who  come  to  this  country  should  fully  inte  grate,  which  means  accepting  Aus  tralian  values,  learning  the  English  language  and  understanding  that  our  society  may  be  more  progressive  than  the  one  they  have  left,  in  areas  such  as  the  equality  of  women.   Terrorism  was  mentioned  neither   in  the  question  nor  in  the  answer.   Ironically,  the  same  edition  of  the  AJN  features  an  eminently  sensible  letter  by  the  ADC’s  executive  officer,  Manny  Waks,  supporting  the  PM’s  stance  on  the  Muslim  community  response  to  terrorism.

"  mum   Jewish  news   Shame  on  the  sheikh   THE  fallout  from  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilal/s  latest  tirade  says  more   about  the  moderate  Muslims  than  the  extremists.  Though  his  long  time  spokesman,  Keysar  Trad,  once  again  rolled  out  his  standard  response  that  the  good  sheikh  had  been  misinterpreted  and  misquoted,  we’ve  heard  that  chorus  for  almost  two  decades,  as  Sheikh  Hilaly  has  adopted  the  notoriously  Arafet-esque  approach  of  saying  one  thing  in  Arabic  to  his  frithful,  and  something  altogether  different  in  English  to  the  media.   But  Sheikh  Hilal/s  latest  grotesque  torrent  of  abuse  -  this  time  offending  the  entire  female  population  -  offered  the  moderates  in  the  Muslim  camp  their  moment  of  truth;  a  litmus  test  for  them  to  show,  once  and  for  all,  that  Sheikh  Hilal/s  radical  views  do  not  represent  them.   Despite  some  encouraging  signs,  for  the  most  part,  the  moderates  failed  once  again.  Some  moderate  Muslims  on  the  street  did  speak  out,  the  Islamic   Council  of  Victoria  called  for  his  removal  and  the  Australian  Federation  of   Islamic  Councils  is  rescinding  the  post  of  mufti.  But  other  Muslim  religious  leaders  actually  supported  Sheikh  Hilaly,  while  the  Lebanese  Muslim  Associa  tion  (LMA),  which  controls  the  Lakemba  Mosque  where  Sheikh  Hilaly  is  imam,  could  only  deliver  a  rap  on  his  knuckles,  telling  him  to  stop  sermonis  ing  for  a  few  months.   To  paraphrase  the  famous  poem  by  German  Pastor  Martin  Niemoller,  Sheikh  Hilaly  first  came  for  the  Jews,  when  in  1988  he  called  us  “the  cause  of  all  wars”,  among  other  outrageous  antisemitic  epithets.  Then  he  attacked  Christians  and  other  “heathens”,  denied  the  Holocaust  and  lauded  suicide  bombers,  including  Palestinian  and  Hezbollah  terrorists.  Now  he  has  offended  the  entire  female  population  -  and  still,  many  moderates  remain  silent,  though  it  seems  it  is  just  a  matter  of  time  before  moderate  Islam  itself  becomes  the  object  of  Sheikh  Hilal/s  tirades.   Shame  on  the  sheikh,  and  shame  on  moderate  Muslims  for  allowing  them  selves  to  be  woefully  short-changed  by  a  firebrand  cleric  whose  sole  “contribu  tion”  has  been  to  widen  the  chasm  between  the  Islamic  community  and  the   rest  of  multicultural  Australia.

"  Bor  at:  who  has  the  last  laugh?   VIEWPOINT   DANNY  KATZ   Borat  is  excruciatingly  funny,   but  the  laugh  is  at  the  expense  of  others.   I  wonder  what  western  audiences  would  make  of  a  Muslim  actor  playing  a  Jewishy  stereotype  who   happens  to  despise  Muslims.   A  COMEDIAN  friend  didn’t   want  to  see  the  new  Borat  movie  with  me:  he  said  he   had  mixed  feelings  about  this  style  of  modem  comedy  where  a  performer  will  do  just  about  anything  for  a  laugh,  humiliate  anybody,  leave  no  taboo  unbroken  -  and  after  seeing  the  film,  I  kind  of  know  what  he   means.   I  mean,  man,  I  laughed  a  lot,  and  so  did  everyone  else  in  the  packed-out  cinema  -  on  a  sheer  chortles-per  minute-count,  this  must  be  one  of  the  funniest  films  since  Flying  High  back   in  1980.   But  it  was  laughter  of  excruciation,  laughter  of  shock,  laughter  of  you  can’t-do-that-but-you-just-did,  and  after  a  while  you  get  numb  to  it,  you  can’t  be  shocked  anymore,  you  just  want  a  story  and  some  drama  that  you  can  latch  on  to.   It’s  complicated,  because  I  really  did  adore  this  film,  and  at  the  same  time,  it  irked  me  a  bit.  Borat  is  a  bril  liantly  conceived  character,  and  Sacha   Baron  Cohen  is  a  fearless  and  clever  satirist,  but  I’m  a  little  uncomfortable  with  the  idea  of  a  Jewish  actor  playing   a  Muslim-ish  stereotype  who  hap  pens  to  despise  Jews  -  with  the  state  of  the  world  as  it  is,  I’m  not  sure  this  is  entirely  helpful,  and  I  wonder  what   western  audiences  would  make  of  a   Muslim  actor  playing  a  Jewishy  stereotype  who  happens  to  despise   Muslims.   And  also,  just  like  my  comedian  friend,  I  worry  about  this  current  fad  of  guerrilla  comedy,  with  movies  like  Borat  and  Jackass,  where  boundaries  of  taste  are  irrelevant,  and  the  laughs  must  be  won  at  all  cost,  usually  at  the  expense  of  others.

NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies   CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  said.   The  initiative  -  run  in  conjunc  tion  with  the  Musiim-based  Affinity  Intercultural  Foundation  and  Chris  tian  Kincoppal  Rose  Bay  -  is  in  its  third  year  of  operation  and  has  doubled  in  size  each  year.

She  added  that  while  she  thought  Sheikh  Hilal/s  comments  were  “not  appropriate”,  she  believed  he  was  misquoted.   Fetnat  Moussali,  a  student  at  Noor  Al  Houda  school,  said:  ""Sheikh  Hilal/s  comments  regard  ing  women  were  based  on  what  our  book  says  and  sometimes  if  a  woman’s  skirt  is  too  short,  she  may  put  herself  at  risk.”   Masada  College  student  Rebecca  Glaser,  16,  added:  “I  have   learned  that  the  religious  traditions  in  Judaism,  Christianity  and  Islam  have  so  many  commonalities.  This  inter-faith  dialogue  has  enabled  me  to  engage  with  those  who  I  would  not  usually  come  into  contact  with.""   John  Fisher,  a  Year  11  student  at  Shore  College,  said:  “Although  I  have  learned  various  things  about  what  people  of  other  religions  believe,  and  how  they  go  about  wor  ship,  I  think  the  most  important  les  son  was  that  the  media  may  falsely  represent  some  groups.  It  was  refreshing  to  see  a  realistic  repre  sentation  of  the  views  of  [other  reli  gious  groups].”   Virginia  Judge,  the  MP  for  Strathfield,  encouraged  students  to  respect  each  other's  faiths.   “Respect  the  culture,  language  and  religion  of  others  and  take  the  lessons  learned  in  the  forum  back  to  your  communities.  I  hope  you  will  all  play  a  part  in  making  this  great  nation  a  better  place  to  live.”   The  Youth  Encounters  program  began  in  2004  with  60  students  from  three  schools.

"  Dancing  to  a  multicultural  beat   MELISSA  SINGER   UP  until  two  weeks  ago,  Sarah  Shihata,   a  Year  12  student  at  East  Preston   Islamic  College,  had  never  met  a  Jew.   Meanwhile,  across  town,  Shifra  Joseph,  a  Jewish  University  of  Mel  bourne  student  of  Indian  descent,  grew  up  in  Taylors  Lakes,  far  away  from  the  traditionally  Jewish  suburbs  of   Caulfield  and  St  Kilda  East   But  earlier  this  month,  a  program  aimed  at  building  bridges  between  Jew  ish  and  Muslim  youth  brought  the  two  girls  together.   Launched  on  April  9  with  a  picnic  for  around  100  people,  Embracing  Youth,  a  joint  initiative  of  B’nai  B’rith’s  Anti-Defamation  Commission  (ADC)  and  the  Australian  Intercultural  Society  (AIS),  aims  to  bring  together  Jewish  and  Muslim  children,  teenagers  and  young  adults  for  a  series  of  educational   and  social  events  to  foster  inter-cultural   friendships  and  break  down  racial  and  religious  stereotypes.   Sarah,  16,  is  one  of  approximately  20  members  on  the  Embracing  Youth  organising  committee.  Even  at  this  early  stage  of  the  project,  she  said  she  has  already  discovered  numerous  similari  ties  between  her  Egyptian  background  and  Jewish  traditions  and  customs,  par  ticularly  in  relation  to  food  and  dance.   “It  makes  me  feel  that  somehow   we’re  really  close  to  each  other,”  she  said.   Joseph,  who  is  the  Australasian  Jew  ish  Union  of  Students’  (AUJS’)  Victori  an  inter-faith  officer,  said  that  as  she  grew  up  surrounded  by  Muslim  neigh  bours,  she  felt  like  something  of  a  bridge  between  the  two  groups.   “There  are  a  lot  of  people  who  are  more  different  [to  each  other]  than  Jews  are  to  Muslims,”  she  said.   Joseph  said  the  most  common  mis  conceptions  among  her  Jewish  friends  were  that  all  Muslims  have  strict  par  ents,  wear  headscarves  and  force  the  women  in  their  community  to  be  sub  servient  to  their  male  counterparts.   “The  root  cause  of  a  lot  of  racism  is   that  people  don’t  understand  each  other,”  said  Joseph.   Following  the  success  of  last  year’s  Building  Bridges  project,  which  brought  together  10  Muslim  and  10  Jewish  families  for  activities  including  a  model  seder  and  mosque  visit,  ADC  inter-faith  committee  chair  Walter  Rapoport,  together  with  representatives  from  the  AIS,  obtained  a  $44,000Victo  rian  Government  Living  in  Harmony  grant  to  start  Embracing  Youth.   Rapoport  told  the  AJN  the  chief  objectives  of  the  project  are  to  “educate  each  group  about  the  beliefs  and  tradi  tions”  of  the  “other”;  discuss  ways  in   which  each  community's  traditions   have  contributed  to  Australian  society;  enhance  participation  in  Australian  society  though  increased  integration;  and  facilitate  cross-cultural  friendships.   Organisations  involved  in  the  proj  ect  include  The  King  David  School,  Habonim  Dror,  Hashomer  Hatzair,  SKIF,  AUJS,  Isik  College,  Selimiye  Youth,  El  Sadeaq  Islamic  Society,  the  Association  of  Turkish  University  Stu  dents  of  Australia  and  Light  United  Soccer  Club.   He  said  unlike  adults  freed  with  a   similarly  confronting  situation,  “the  youth  let  it  hang  out  straight  away.  The   conversation  revolves  around  what  all  kids  do.  —   “It  took  me  back  50  years  to  Carlton  when  kids  began  to  talk  to  each  other  as  if  they’ve  been  close  friends  their  whole   lives.”   While  several  activities  planned  for  the  Embracing  Youth  program  will  mirror  Building  Bridges,  a  panel  discus  sion  on  youth  issues  facing  both  com  munities  is  one  of  several  new  additions.   And  although  Rapoport  is  one  of  several  “adults”  in  charge  of  the  project,  he  stresses  the  need  to  be  “very  cog  nisant  that  I’m  not  running  the  show,  that  I’m  not  making  all  the  decisions  -  it’s  up  to  the  kids  to  make  it  work.”   Habonlm  Dror’s  Daniel  Platt  (left)  and  Islk  Collie  student  Mete  Temurchln  perform  a  Turkish  dance  at  the  Embracing  Youth  launch.

After  they  had  lit  the  candles,  ate  kosher  food  and  drank  grape  juice,  half  the  group  went  out  side  and  prayed  towards  the  west,  while  the  rest  watched.  '   Five  Year  12  students  of  Sule  Col   lege,  all  practising  Muslims,  prayed  at  sundown,  but  not  before  attending  services  at  Central  Syna  gogue  and  dining  at  the  home  of  Moriah  College  Year  12  student  Jenna  Bloom.   Jenna  said  the  initial  purpose  of  the  dinner  was  “to  bridge  gaps  [between  the  groups]  and  learn  about  religion”.   She  met  students  from  the  Liver  pool  school  at  2006  Youth  Encoun  ters,  a  two-day  seminar  that  brought  together  200  Year  12  students  in  inter-faith  dialogue.   Zainib  Cheema,  17,  said  the  night  was  “amazing”.   “I  felt  so  welcomed  throughout.  It   was  awesome  to  be  able  to  do  this.”   That  evening,  she  learned  about  Chanukah  and  recited  prayers  through  transliteration  with  her  peers,  Adam  Hafda,  Omer  Tas,   Subhi  Bora  and  Ertan  Uzul.   Zainib  said  she  was  impressed  by  the  beauty  of  the  shul  and  the  Shabbat  traditions,  but  her  favourite  part  was  “eating  and  laughing  ...  by  the  end  of  night,  everything  melted  away,  and  we  were  just  a  couple  of   friends  around  a  table”.   Moriah  student  Danna  Fain,  who  was  also  at  the  event,  said  that  through  her  interactions  with  the  Muslim  students  since  Youth  Encounters,  she  hopes  to  break  down  religious  barriers,  because  '■“they’re  teenagers  just  like  us”   The  other  Jewish  students  at  the   zainib  cneema  fights  the  Shabbat   candles,  while  (from  left)  Danna  Fain,  OmerTas  and  Jenna  Bloom  look  on.

Gina  said  the  group  decided  not  to  invite  parents  to  the  dinner  to  make  it  “more  comfortable”   “We  didn’t  want  the  parents  to   facilitate  conversations.”   Josh  Levin  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  launched  Youth  Encounters  in  partnership  with  Muslim  organisation  Affinity  Inter  cultural  Foundation  with  60  stu  dents  in  2004.  “I’m  thrilled  to  see  that  people  are  taking  the  idea  fur  ther  and  bringing  it  into  their  own  homes,”  he  said.   Central  Synagogue’s  Rabbi  Levi  Wolff  hoped  that  the  Muslim  stu  dents  would  be  encouraged  to  “share  with  people  in  their  own  community  the  warmth  and  energy  we  have  toward  people  who  want  to  learn  how  to  respect  other  religions”.   Jenna  also  hopes  the  relationship  between  the  students  will  continue.   “They  already  invited  us  to  the  mosque  sometime  soon.  It  would  be  interesting  to  see  the  other  side.” ",2006-12-22
"  Al-Qaeda  threatens  Israel   NEW  YORK  -  Confirming  recent  warnings  by  Israeli  intelligence  ana  lysts,  a!-Qaeda's  deputy  leader,  Ayman  al  Zawahri  (pictured),  has  hinted  that  Israel  may  be  the  target  of  future  attacks  by  the  group.   In  a  video  aired  by  CNN  on  the  eve  of  the  fifth  anniversary  of  the  September  11  attacks,  al-Zawahri  refers  to  Israel’s  bom  bardment  of  Lebanon  in  July-August  and  the  capture  of  Israeli  soldiers  by  Hezbollah  and  Hamas.  “You  gave  us  every  legitimacy  and  every  opportunity  to  continue  fighting  you,”  al-Zawahri  says,  addressing  the  US  in  the  video,  which  appeared  to  be  new.  “You  should  worry  about  your  presence  in  the   [Persian]  Gulf,  and  the  second  place  you  should  worry  about  is  Israel.”   Israeli  intelligence  experts  -  including  the  head  of  Shin  Bet,  Yuval  Diskin  -  have  warned  in  recent  months  about  the  increasing  attempts  by  al-Qaeda  to  infil  trate  the  territories  and  to  enlist  Palestini  ans  in  a  renewed  terror  campaign  against  Israel.  Diskin  told  the  Israeli  Cabinet  sever  al  weeks  ago  that  the  Sinai  Desert  is  turn  ing  into  a  staging  ground  for  al-Qaeda's  attempts  to  smuggle  sophisticated  weapons  into  Gaza.   Egyptian-born  al-Zawahri,  Osama  bin  Laden’s  deputy,  criticised  the  West  for  sup  plying  Israel  with  weapons,  and  called  on  the  Muslim  world  “to  rush  with  everything  at  its  disposal  to  the  aid  of  its  Muslim  brothers  in  Lebanon  and  Gaza”.

"  Whose  Mid-East  narrative?   Israel  and  the  Palestinians  are  battling  for  media  supremacy.  But  two  new  books  suggest  very  different  outcomes.  By  DEBORAH  STONE   NOTHER  new  book  has  come   /  out  on  Muslims   and  the  Middle   jP  ^East  and  again   Israel  is  painted  as  the  bad  guy   in  a  black-and-white  narrative  with  a  single  soundtrack  in  a  minor  key.   Us  and  Them  by  Peter  Manning  is  a  survey  of  Muslim  positions  in  var  ious  countries  which  aims  to   redress  a  perceived  imbalance  by  promoting  the  Muslim  point  of  view.   The  author  takes  as  his  starting  point  a  belief  that  Israel  is  well  served  by  a  media  beholden  to  the  US  and  that  the  Palestinians  are  part  of  a  still-misunderstood  Muslim  margin.  His  discursive  book  is  part  travelogue,  part  opinion  writing,  ranging  across  issues  whose  only  connection  is  Muslim  dramatis  personae  -  Indonesia,  Lebanon  and  Syria,  as  well  as  Israel   and  the  Palestinians.   Manning  is  a  distinguished  Australian  journalist  who  deserves  to  be  taken  seriously.  But  in  regard  to  the  Middle  East  he  comes  across  as  extraordinarily  naive,  so  charmed  with  Lebanese  pastries  and  smoking  nargillehs  that  he  loses  any  professional  scepticism.   To  understand  where  this  book  goes  wrong  it  is  helpful  to  look  at  another  recently  published  book  on  the  Middle  East  and  the  media.   The  Other  War  by  Stephanie  Gutmann  is  an  analysis  of  foreign  correspondent  reporting  of  the  sec  ond  intifada,  focused  on  how  the  parties  to  the  conflict  succeed  or  fail  in  manipulating  the  media.   Gutmann  is  an  American  journal  ist  with  some  family  ties  to  Israel  and  solid  experience  working  among  foreign  reporters  on  the  ground.  Her  book  argues  that  Israel  has  come  out  badly  in  the  media  not  because  of  inherent  failures  in  its  military  or  ethical  position  but  because  of  its  failure  to  understand  and  manipulate  the  narrative.   Gutmann  highlights  a  frequently  misunderstood  factor  in  the  way  the  media  works  and  one  which  many  journalists  only  know  about  subconsciously;  the  narrative  of  a  story  frequently  dictates  the  way  the  facts  are  presented.   When  we  strive  to  comprehend  and  assess  media  coverage  of  something  we  care  about,  when  Jews  read  stories  about  Israel,  for  instance,  we  judge  how  the  stories  we  are  told  are  concordant  or   (frequently)  discordant  with  the   stories  we  tell  ourselves.   Journalists  choose  what  they  report  and  how  they  report  it  in  relation  to  an  unspoken  but  essen  tial  narrative  line  that  runs  through  what  they  write.  If  they  didn’t  they  would  produce  unreadable  lists  of  disconnected  facts.   Cadet  reporters  are  rarely  taught  complex  narrative  skills.  They  absorb  the  importance  of  the  narrative  through  learning  the  essential  but  ephemeral  skill  of  “news  judgment”,  the  ability  to  assess  events  in  terms  of  how  they  can  be  translated  into  marketable   commodities  as  news  stories.   Each  story  has  its  own  narrative  line  marked  by  plot  and  characteri  sation,  frequently  as  essential  to  the  news  story  as  they  are  to  a  fairy  tale  or  thriller.  Few  journalists  are  used  to  analysing  themselves  and  many  are  somewhat  bewitched  by  the  power  of  their  own  narratives.  An  attraction  to  shaping  the  story  powerfully  can  cause  them  to  make  poor  judgments  about  the  facts  they  choose.   'Vhe.  con-flic!  in  fke   .Middle  £as!  is   probably  !ke  most  e&gt;cIreme  example  of  sustained/  albei!   changed/  meta   na^mfive.   This  occupational  hazard  is  mag  nified  and  aggravated  when  a  story  is  part  of  an  on-going  “meta-narra  tive”,  an  over-arching  view  of  a  situ  ation  which  slots  each  new  event  into  an  almost  predetermined  place  in  the  big  story.  The  conflict  in  the  Middle  East  is  probably  the  most  extreme  example  of  sustained,  albeit  changed,  metanarrative.   Diaspora  Jews  are  among  those  who  watch  the  progress  of  this  meta-narrative  of  the  “Israel  story”  with  concern  and,  increasingly,  with  dismay.  Many  express  their  feelings  about  the  way  the  Israel  story  is  told  in  simple,  not  to  say  vehement,  terms  which  label  particular  outlets  or  individual  reporters  as  “anti  Israel”  or  even  “antisemitic”.  Such  labelling  rarely  reflects  a  genuine  understanding  of  the  way  news  judgment  works  although  it  may  not  always  be  entirely  off  the  mark  about  its  effects.   kUTMANN’S  very  telling  .case  studies  examine  in   |detail  how  particular   events  in  the  intifada  were  trans  lated  into  news  stories  in  a  way  in  which,  ultimately,  the  story’s  fidelity  to  events  became  irrelevant  to  the  propaganda  war.   Her  first  and  most  powerful  case  study  is  of  Mohammed  al-Dura,  the  12-year-old  boy  who  was  immor  talised  dead  in  his  father’s  arms  in   the  early  days  of  the  intifada  in  2000.  Gutmann  casts  important  doubts  on  the  truth  of  the  received  story  that  the  al-Duras  were  inno  cent  civilians  shot  by  Israel,  sug  gesting  that  they  may  have  been  shot  by  Palestinian  forces  and  pos  sibly  even  set  up  as  sacrificial  vic  tims  for  media  consumption.   But  perhaps  more  importantly  from  the  point  of  view  of  under  standing  the  way  the  al-Dura  image  has  been  used,  she  shows  how  journalists  were  beholden  to  Palestinian  forces  in  their  ability  to  tell  the  story.  Israel’s  self-sufficient  investigative  process  -  where  jus  tice  was  done  but  not  seen  to  be  done  -  played  into  their  hands.   Gutmann  analyses  how  Israel  has  been  the  victim  of  a  changed  meta-narrative:  once  the  plucky  lit  tle  guy  in  the  conflict,  it  is  now  painted  as  Goliath  to  the  Palestinians’  David.   Us  and  Them  is  a  case  in  point.  Manning  commits  one  of  the  jour  nalistic  sins  Gutmann  discusses,  becoming  so  identified  with  his  contacts  On  Israel  all  Palestinians)  that  he  can  only  tell  their  story.   Similarly,  Manning  was  a  player,  not  a  journalist,  in  relation  to  the  Han  an  Ashrawi  affair,  in  which  he  was  part  of  the  support  group  that  promoted  her  receipt  of  the  2003  Sydney  Peace  Prize.  In  the  book,  he  never  overcomes  the  anomalous   position  of  journalist-analyst  and  proponent  of  a  cause.  Perhaps  we  are  meant  to  read  him  as  one  who   has  crossed  the  fence,  propelled  by  the  justice  of  the  Muslim  position.   But  those  who  know  the  field  know  there  is  no  single  “Muslim  position”.  His  failure  to  explore  con  flicting  and  problematic  aspects  of  the  groups  he  wants  to  love  make  him  unconvincing  to  a  reader  who  knows  the  field.   It  is  unfortunate  that  Manning’s  book,  with  an  Australian  publisher,  accessible  style  and  known  author,  will  probably  be  more  widely  read  in  Australia  than  Gutmann’s  excel  lent  though  more  complex  analysis.  If  only  those  who  write  the  stories  and  make  the  judgments  would  read  Gutmann  they  might  under  stand  the  fragility  and  danger  of  the  story-telling  endeavour.

"  Combating  cartoons:  on  streets  or  in  courts?   MARK  FRANKLIN   AS  outraged  Muslims  rioted  overseas  in  protest  against  offensive  cartoons  of  die  Prophet  Mohammed  this  week,  Australian  Jewish  leaders  won  an  “unreserved  and  unconditional”  apol  ogy  in  Federal  Court  over  an  antise  mitic  cartoon  published  by  the  newspaper  of  a  political  party.   Riots  in  Syria,  Lebanon  and  Afghanistan  this  week  left  five  people   dead,  dozens  injured,  and  three  embassies  burned  to  the  ground  more  than  four  months  after  the  12  cartoons  were  originally  published  in  Den  mark’s  Jylbnds-Posten  newspaper.   Meanwhile,  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  was  satis  fied  by  its  legal  victory  over  the  Nation,  the  mouthpiece  of  the  Queensland  branch  of  the  One  Nation  party  (see  story,  right),  which   in  2004  described  Jews  as  “the  world’s  chief  purveyors  of  filth,  degradation   and  decadence”.   Defending  the  right  of  newspapers  to  publish  controversial  cartoons,  Vic  torian  Council  of  Civil  Liberties  for  mer  president  Robert  Richter  said  the  proper  way  to  seek  remedies  for  mate  rial  that  oversteps  the  mark  is  through  the  courts,  as  demonstrated  by  the  ECAJ.  CONTINUED  ON  NEWS  6   Combating  offensive  cartoons:   on  the  streets  or  in  the  courts?   CONTINUED  FROM  NEWS  1   “The  reaction  by  violence  is  less  acceptable  than  the  publication  of  material  that  one  might  find  insult  ing,”  he  said  “The  response  by  vio  lence  is  something  that  we  gave  away  when  we  stopped  burning  blasphe  mers  and  stoning  heretics.”   Demonstrating  other  peaceful  avenues  for  recompense,  Australian  Jews  last  month  sought  amends  in  the  letters  pages  of  newspapers  over  a  car  toon  by  the  Ages  Michael  Leunig,  which  appeared  to  equate  ailing  Israeli   Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  with  Hamas  founder  Sheikh  Ahmed  Yassin.   As  in  Judaism,  Islam  prohibits  the  depiction  of  sacred  figures  as  a  form  of  idol  worship.  Islamic  Friendship   Association  of  Australia  founder   Kaysar  Trad  emphasised  the  genuine   hurt  that  the  cartoons  have  caused   many  Muslims.   ""We’re  deeply  offended  by  these  cartoons  and  it  is  an  outrage  that  they  were  published.  They  were  not  just  slandering  a  great  individual  but,  through  that  slander,  they  were  slan  dering  every  Muslim,”  he  said.   Three  of  the  cartoons  depicted  Mohammed  as  a  terrorist,  he  said.  “It  is  the  equivalent  of  going  to  other  reli   gions  and  depicting  their  great  figures  by  the  actions  of  their  most  violent  followers  and  it  shows  a  great  deal  of  contempt  by  the  publishers  of  the  emotions  of  every  Muslim.”   Jeremy  Jones,  a  longtime  inter  faith  activist,  said  that  as  well  as  being  a  cause  of  genuine  offence  for  Mus  lims,  the  Danish  cartoons  are  being  used  as  a  “pretext”  for  claiming  that  the  West  is  “opposed  to  everything   Islam  stands  for”.   He  suggested  that  international  Islamic  outrage  was  partly  a  result  of  the  globalising  impact  of  the  internet.  Whereas  the  Danish  public  were  once  the  only  readers  of  Danish  newspa  pers,  Jones  said  Danish  newspapers  -   like  all  others  -  could  now  be  accessed   via  internet  by  people  throughout  the  world,  with  differing  cultural  sensitiv   ities.   “It’s  really  very  rich  to  threaten  people  in  Denmark  for  doing  what  people  in  Denmark  have  always  done,”  Jones  added,  referring  to  threats  of  boycotts  and  further  retalia  tion  against  Denmark   Dr  Michael  Fagenblat,  a  lecturer  at  Monash  University’s  Centre  for  the  Study  of  Jewish  Civilisation,  said  the   Islamic  reaction  “marks  a  turn  in  the   brazenness  by  which  some  of  the   voices  are  challenging  fundamental   western  values.   “It  seems  to  be  a  challenge  to  a  country’s  own  right  to  represent  in  its  own  media  its  forms  of  social  critique  or  political  opinion.”   He  said  Islamic  leaders  were  seek   ing  to  “dictate  across  borders  into   another  nation  and  determine  what   form  of  political  and  media  represen  tation  should  be  permitted,  and  it  seems  to  be  another  step  forward  in  a  tragic  and  self-fulfilling  cultural  war”   B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commission  chairman  Dr  Paul  Gard  ner  accused  Middle  Eastern  Islamic   leaders  of  hypocrisy  for  condemning  the  Danish  cartoons  while  condoning  “despicable  anti-Jewish  caricatures  [which]  appear  almost  daily  in  gov  ernment-controlled  newspapers  across  the  Arab  and  Muslim  world”.   “One  would  hope  that  leaders  of   Arab  and  Muslim  countries  would   turn  all  of  the  anger  being  aimed  at  the  European  press  into  a  larger  lesson  for  their  own  people  about  the  power  of  images,”  he  said.

"  2002  peace  statement  ‘achieved  nothing’   MELISSA  SINGER   A  JOINT  statement  for  peace  signed  by  leaders  of  the  NSW  Jewish  commu  nity  and  controversial  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly  in  April  2002  completely  failed  in  its  objectives,  one  of  its  signa   tories  said  this  week.   Great  Synagogue  Rabbi  Emeritus  Raymond  Apple,  who  signed  the  con  tentious  document  with  then  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Stephen  Rothman,  said  images  of  Sheikh  Hilaly  wearing  a  keffiyeh  and  wielding  placards  depicting  Israeli  prime  minister  Ariel  Sharon  decorated  with  swastikas  just  two  weeks  after  the  historic  signing  were  a   “stab  in  the  back”.   “[From  then  on]  I  became  increas  ingly  reluctant  to  share  any  occasion  with  a  man  who  could  not  be  trusted,”  Rabbi  Apple  told  the  AJN  from  Jerusalem  this  week.   The  statement,  which  called  for  Mid-East  peace  and  an  end  to  hostili  ties  between  Australian  Jews  and  Mus  lims,  which  had  escalated  following  the  alleged  massacre  by  IDF  troops  at  Jenin,  said:  “Islamic  and  Jewish  leaders  of  NSW  call  upon  all  members  of  their   communities  and  all  other  Australians   not  to  allow  their  personal  feelings  about  events  in  the  Middle  East  to  find  expression  in  violent  behaviour.”   It  also  called  for  the  cessation  of  “all   acts  of  violence  and  military  actions  and  to  use  rational,  peaceful  dialogue  to  achieve  a  just  peace  [in  the  region]”.   Last  month,  Sheikh  Hilaly  came  under  pressure  to  resign  as  mufti  of   Australia  and  imam  of  Lakemba   Mosque  over  a  sermon  he  gave  during  Ramadan  in  which  he  reportedly  accused  women  of  inviting  sexual  abuse.  He  has  since  taken  indefinite  leave  from  Lakemba  Mosque,  but  his  long-term  fate  is  still  unclear.   Dr  Ron  Weiser,  then  president  of  the  Zionist  Federation  of  Australia,  said  it  was  “obscene”  for  the  Jewish  com  munity  to  co-sign  a  statement  with  Sheikh  Hilaly,  whose  antisemitic  and  anti-Israel  views  were  well  document   ed.  “The  call  for  communal  harmony  was  a  very  good  call  -  it  was  just  made  with  the  wrong  person,”  Dr  Weiser  said  this  week.  “It  was  made  with  a  Muslim   cleric  who  does  the  opposite  of  enhancing  communal  harmony.  Sadly  this  realisation  came  only  lately  to   some  of  our  communal  leaders.”   Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  national  chairman  Mark  Leibler,  who  at  the  time  accused  Rabbi  Apple  and  Rothman  of  “appalling  judgment”,  told  the  AJN  this  week  that  Shiekh  Hilal/s  subse  quent  behaviour  “highlights  the  fact  there’s  no  point  in  signing  meaning  less  memorandums  of  understanding   with  unreconstructed  antisemites”.   He  said  the  statement  could  have   only  benefited  the  Muslim  leadership.   “Some  people  who  hold  us  [Jews]  in  contempt,  who  oppose  everything  that  we  stand  for  —  it  occasionally  suits  them  to  be  parties  to  memorandums  of  understanding  of  that  nature  ...  to  help  bolster  their  position  when  it  becomes  untenable.  I  don’t  think  we   ought  provide  that  sort  of  assistance.”   Although  Rabbi  Apple  acknowl  edged  some  “disquiet”  over  Sheikh  Hilal/s  involvement,  “we  hoped  that  getting  some  form  of  relatively  positive  commitment  from  him  was  a  good  sign”.   Leibler  and  others  also  criticised  the  wording  of  the  statement  —  which  was  brokered  by  former  premier  Bob  Carr’s  Community  Relations  Com  mission  and  reportedly  went  through  several  drafts  -  for  creating  a  moral  equivalence  between  the  actions  of  the  Israeli  Army  and  Palestinian  terrorists.   Rabbi  Apple  said  that,  despite  the  critics,  he  had  hoped  that  “in  the  end  [they]  would  agree  that  we  had  got   somewhere”.   But  when  asked  whether  in  hind   sight  the  statement  achieved  anything  for  Jewish-Muslim  relations  in  Aus  tralia,  he  responded:  “No,  it  did  not.”   In  response  to  Sheikh  Hilal/s  latest  outburst  about  women,  Rabbi  Apple  said:  “My  advice  to  him  is  to  fade  into  retirement.  Would  I  sign  anything  else  with  him?  Not  as  things  stand.”   But  Leibler  called  on  the  Lebanese   Muslim  community  to  take  tougher  action  against  its  radical  leader.   “It’s  a  pity  he  wasn’t  deported  when  it  was  possible  to  deport  him  [in  the  1980s].  I  can  only  hope  that  his  own  community,  despite  the  views  that  the/ve  expressed,  will  eventually  come   to  understand  that  it’s  not  in  their   interests  to  retain  a  spokesman  and  leader  who  espouses  [these]  sort  of   views.” ",2006-11-10
"  Jews  laud  Islamic  book  ban   PETER  KOHN   JEWISH  community  leaders  have  praised  this  week’s  historic  banning  of  two  Islamic  books  inciting  suicide  bombing  and  terrorism.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  deputy  president  Rabbi  John  Levi  said:  “It  is  gratifying  to  know  the  government  has  taken  these  texts  very  seriously.  It’s  not  a  matter  of  censor  ship  but  of  responsibility.”   But  he  expressed  concern  at  the  continued  availability  of  inciteful  material  at  Islamic  bookshops.   Race-hate  texts  have  previously  been  sighted  at  bookshops  in  the  Mel  bourne  suburb  of  Brunswick  and  the  Sydney  suburb  of  Lakemba.   The  Federal  Government’s  Classifi  cation  Review  Board  (CRB)  handed  down  its  ruling  last  week,  banning  Defence  of  the  Muslim  Lands  and  Join  The  Caravan  from  sale  or  publication  in  Australia.  It  is  the  first  time  the  CRB   has  banned  material  for  inciting  ter   rorism.   The  banned  texts  were  among  eight  books  and  a  film  submitted  to  the  CRB  by  Attorney-General  Philip   Ruddock  last  month.   A  film,  Jihad  Or  Terrorism,  also  submitted  by  the  Attorney-General’s  Office,  has  been  classified  PG  (parental  guidance  recommended).   In  a  statement  released  this  week,  the  CRB  said  Defence  of  the  Muslim  Lands  was  refused  classification  “because  it  promotes  and  incites  in  matters  of  crime,  specifically  terror  ism  acts,  including  the  plan,  action  and  execution  of  martyrdom  opera   tions”.   The  book  was  translated  from  Ara   bic  into  English  in  1995  by  Muslims  seeking  support  for  the  Mujahadeen  in  Bosnia  and  was  republished  in   2002.   “It  is  gratifying  to  know  the  government  has   taken  these  texts  very  seriously.  It’s  not  a   matter  of  censorship,  j  but  of  responsibility!’   RABBI  JOHN  LEVI  Deputy  president,  ECAJ   Join  The  Caravan  was  refused  clas   sification  “because  it  has  the  objective  purpose  of  promoting  and  inciting  acts  of  terrorism  against  ‘disbelievers’  and  is  a  real  and  genuine  call  to  specif  ic  action  by  Muslims  to  fight  for  Allah  and  engage  in  acts  of  violence”.   The  book  was  first  published  in   English  in  1996  and  reprinted  in  2001.   The  author  of  both  books  was  Sheik  Abdullah  Azzam,  known  as  “the  godfather  of  jihad”  and  a  mentor  to   Osama  Bin  Laden.   Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  (AIJAC)  director  of  interna  tional  and  community  affairs  Jeremy   Jones  described  the  banned  books  as  “unsophisticated,  blatant  calls  to  criminal,  terrorist  action.  AIJAC  has  sought  in  the  past  to  call  attention  to  Defence  of  the  Muslim  Lands  and  other  books  whose  main  purpose  is  to  con  vince  Muslims  that  they  have  a  reli  gious  obligation  to  commit  terrorist   violence.”   However,  AIJAC  “is  concerned  that  other  pernicious  material  is  unaffect  ed  by  this  decision”,  Jones  added.   CRB  convenor  Maureen  Shelley  stated  that  the  board  “sought  the  opinions  of  a  number  of  organisa  tions  so  that  a  range  of  perspectives   could  be  considered”.   She  said  among  those  consulted  were  the  mufti  of  Australia  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly  and  the  NSW  Council  of  Civil  Liberties.  The  CRB  also  considered  current  Australian  ter  rorism  legislation  in  reaching  its  deci   sion.   The  CRB  includes  one  Jewish  member,  Sydney  lawyer  Rob  Shilkin. ",2006-07-14
"  From  left  Sonia  Tatar,  Elsa  Zylbersteln  and  Bruno  Todeschini  enjoy  a  Shabbat  dinner  in  a  scene  from  La  Petite  Jerusalem.   Confronting  drama  captures   troubled  world  of  French  Jews   I   Film  review   LA  PETITE  JERUSALEM   Reviewed  by  Lorin  Blumenthal   HE  French  drama  La  Petite  Jerusalem  (Little  Jerusalem)  is  set  in  modern-day  Paris,  in  the  derelict  suburb  of  I  Sarcelles  where  Jews  and  Muslims  live  alongside  each  other.  The  tension  between  the  two  groups  is  captured  in  the  explosive  love  of  18-year-old  Jewish  student  Laura  (Fanny  Valette)  and  her  Muslim  lover.   Laura  lives  with  her  widowed  mother  (Sonia  Tahar),  sister  Mathilde  (Elsa  Zylberstein)  and  brother-in-law  (Bruno  Todeschini),  all  of  whom  are  concerned  that  as  she  immerses  herself  in  the  world  of  western  philosophy,  she  is  moving  away  from  the  tenets  of  her  Jewish  faith.   Laura  is  tom  between  the  words  of  the   philosophers  she  venerates,  telling  her  to  maintain  self-discipline  and  resist  all  pleas  ures  of  the  flesh,  her  own  attraction  to  a   Muslim  co-worker  and  the  attempts  of  her  Tunisian-born  mother  to  see  her  wed  a  Jewish  doctor  she  has  no  interest  in.   The  movie  poignantly  captures  the  confu  sion  of  a  young  girl  who  is  struggling  to  find  her  place  in  the  world.   Her  sister  Mathilde  is  dealing  with  difficul  ties  of  her  own.  Her  husband,  frustrated  by  her  insistence  upon  maintaining  modesty,  admits  to  having  an  affair  and  she  is  crushed.  Mathilde  seeks  counsel  from  an  older  Jewish  lady  at  the  mikvah  (Aurore  Clement)  and  is  slowly  able  to  transform  her  marriage.   The  sisters’  relationship  remains  volatile,  as  Mathilde  and  her  husband  are  drawn  fur  ther  into  the  world  of  religious  observance  and  Laura  further  away.   The  movie  captures  the  struggle  of  the  devout  Parisian  Jewish  community  to  remain  faithful  to  their  traditions  in  the  face  of  the  hostility  that  surrounds  them  in  their  dilapi  dated  neighbourhood.  The  movie  opens  with  the  community  members  throwing  bread  from  their  pockets  into  the  river  during   Selichot  and  features  scenes  of  traditional  Sephardic  Shabbat  dinners  and  Purim  and  other  religious  celebrations.   While  Laura  struggles  to  defend  herself  against  her  family’s  attempts  to  bring  her  back  to  the  fold,  she  finally  cannot  resist  her  attraction  to  the  Moroccan  man  who  changes  at  the  locker  behind  hers.  Laura  finds  though  that  her  world  is  not  the  only  one  with  preju  dice  find  is  met  with  hostility  in  the  Muslim  world  her  lover  inhabits.   The  movie  is  charged  with  emotional  intensity  and  proffers  an  insight  into  the  life  of  Jews  struggling  against  poverty,  the  sec  ular  world  and  the  rising  tide  of  antisemitism  in  France.   Featuring  French,  Arabic  and  Hebrew  dia  logue  the  film  is  at  once  beautiful  and  confronting.   La  Petite  Jerusalem  is  part  of  the  French  Film  Festival,  which  screens  at  the  Palace  Academy,  Paddington,  and   Palace  Norton,  Leichhardt,  until  March  20.

"  MUSLIM  CONSTITUENCY   IT  shouldn’t  be  surprising  that  city  councils  with  large  Arab/Muslim  constituencies,  such  as  Leichhardt  and  Marrickville,  have  taken  sides  in  the  Israeli/Arab  conflict.   Another  classic  example  of  politi  cians  courting  the  rising  Arab/Muslim  community  vote  in  Australia  is  when  Paul  Keating  inter   vened  and  allowed  controversial   Sheikh  Hilaly  to  stay  in  Australia.   Visiting  British  journalist  Melanie  Phillips  told  us  that  senior  Labour  Party  figures  in  Tony  Blair’s  govern  ment  say  privately  that  there  are  1.8  million  Muslims  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  only  280,000  identi  fying  Jews,  so  the  Jews  had  better  get   used  to  the  fact  that  their  concerns  are  no  longer  of  any  account,  that  the  Muslim  vote  is  the  only  show  in  town  and  that  therefore  the  Labour  Party  will  adopt  the  “Muslim  narrative”  on   Israel/Palestine.   In  Australia,  there  are  about  five   times  more  Muslims  than  Jews  and  Islam  is  the  fastest-growing  religion,  with  the  majority  of  refugees  and  asylum  seekers  coming  from  Muslim  countries.  Just  like  in  UK  councils  with  large  Muslim  populations,  such  as  Broadmeadows,  which  have  already  tailored  their  food  menus  so  as  not  to  offend  Muslims,  Leichhardt  and  Marrickville  will  follow  and  advocate  for  the  Palestinians.   Perhaps  Jews  should  lobby  the  City  of  Woollahra  and  Port  Philip  to   form  sister  cities  with  Tel  Aviv.   MICHAEL  BURD   Toorak,  Vic ",2007-06-22
"  THE  editors  at  Iranian  weekly  Ya-Laserat  were  looking  for  a  good  picture  to  illustrate  their  story  about  “Religious  beliefs  behind  unjust  dismissal  of  another  Iranian  in  the  US”,  and  never  in  a  million  years  would  you  guess  whom  they  chose:  Israeli  Strategic  Affairs  Minister  Avlgdor  Lieberman.  Lured,  perhaps,  by  the  minister's  beard,  the  paper  chose  Lieberman  as  an  example  of  a  good  Muslim  who  is  misjudged  simply  because  of  his  looks,  according  to  the  Assar-lran  website.  Given  that  Lieberman  is  a  far-right  firebrand  who  “eats  Muslims  for  breakfast”,  as  the  Israelis  say,  you  must  admit  that  what  we  have  here  is  a  classic  case  of  poetic  -  or,  in  this  case,  photographic  -  justice.   r ",2007-07-13

"  Doubts  cast  on   Muslim  party   JASON  FRENKEL   POLITICAL  experts  have  cast  doubt  on  plans  by  the  nation’s  most  senior  Mus  lim  cleric,  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly,  to  set  up  a  new  political  party.   Sheikh  Hilaly,  who  failed  to  deliver  on  his  promise  to  run  candidates  in  the  NSW  State  Election,  said  the  so  called  Australia  Peace  Party  would  be  independent  of  race  and  religion,  despite  the  crucial  role  of  six  anony  mous  Muslim  leaders  as  organisers.   But  Zionist  Federation  of  Australia  president  Philip  Chester  said  he  would  be  surprised  if  the  mooted  party  ever  got  off  the  ground.   “The  Jewish  community  is  right  to  have  reservations  about  what  he  does  ...  and  to  take  everything  he  says  with  a  huge  grain  of  salt.”   Conservative  Jewish  commentators  have  warned  recently  that  growing  Muslim  populations  both  here  and  overseas  could  jeopardise  social  and  political  harmony.   But  political  academic  and  author  Philip  Mendes  said  fears  of  a  powerful  Muslim  lobby  in  Australia  were  prema  ture.  “It  depends  on  having  funding  and  resources,  and  unless  there  are  some  reasonably  wealthy  and  gener  ous  people  willing  to  put  money  up,  it  won't  get  off  the  ground.”   Federal  MP  Michael  Danby  told  the  A/A/:  “It  sounds  to  me  like  a  lot  of  hot  air,  and  the  amount  of  support  they  get  would  be  minimal.

"  Limit  Muslim  intake,  urges  visiting  scholar   JASON  FRENKEL   A  VISITING  Israeli  expert  on  Islam  has  urged  Australia  to  cap  its  intake  of  Muslim  immigrants,  warning  “life   will  become  untenable”  unless  the   Muslim  population  is  kept  in  check.   Raphael  Israeli,  a  professor  in  Islamic  Studies  at  the  Hebrew  Univer  sity  of  Jerusalem,  said  Australia  was  in  danger  of  being  swamped  by  Muslims  -  especially  from  Indonesia  -  and  called  for  a  “preventative  policy”  to  protect  national  security  and  ensure  Muslims  remained  a  “marginal  minority”.   Professor  Israeli,  whose  visit  is  in  part  sponsored  by  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council,  has  just  begun  a  six-week  stint  as  a  scholar-in  residence  at  the  Shalom  Institute  in   Sydney,  where  he  is  teaching  a  course  on  “Understanding  Islam”.   An  author  of  20  books  on  the  Muslim,  Arab  and  Chinese  worlds,  he  will  also  give  talks  in  Melbourne,  Perth,  Brisbane  and  New  Zealand.   In  an  interview  with  the  AJN,  Professor  Israeli  said  radical  Islam  would  not  be  defeated  by  a  war  of   words.   “Limit  the  [Muslim]  immigration  and  therefore  you  keep  them  a  marginal   minority,  which  ...  cannot  pose  a  threat  to  the  demographic  and  security  aspects  of  a  country”  professor  Raphael  Israeli   Islam  scholar   “You  have  to  infiltrate  all  those  circles  where  the  Muslim  radicals  operate,  to  arrest  them,  and  to  limit  immigration  into  western  countries  where  these  Muslims...  who  are  bent   on  destroying  western  civilisation  ...  to  limit  immigration,  even  students  who  apply  to  come  from  Islamic  countries  to  the  West,”  he  said.   “It  serves  no  purpose  when  you  have  this  home-grown  terrorist,  who  has  been  preparing  for  years  to  blow  up  undergrounds  in  London,  and  all   you  do  is  lead  a  war  of  words.

""You  have  to  adopt  some  kind  of  preven  tative  policy.  In  order  not  to  get  there,  limit  the  immigration  and  therefore  you  keep  them  a  marginal  minority,  which  will  be  a  nuisance,  but  cannot  pose  a  threat  to  the  demographic  and  security  aspects  of  a  country’   But  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria  director  Waleed  Aly  branded  the  comments  “ill  advised  and  foolish""  and  said  Professor  Israeli  didn't  understand  Australia.   “It  is  clearly  possible  in  the  current  envi  ronment  to  say  things  about  Muslims  that  you  simply  cannot  say  about  anyone  else,”  Aly  said.  “The  fundamental  problem  at  the  heart  of  this  is  that  he  seems  to  be  sug  gesting  that  increased  marginalisation  of  Muslim  populations  will  somehow  produce  something  other  than  mutual  resentment  It  should  be  obvious  to  anyone  really  that  it’s   doomed  to  failure.”   Officially,  there  are  fewer  than  300,000  Muslims  in  Australia  according  to  the  2001  Census,  but  Muslim  community  officials  esti  mate  the  actual  number  to  be  at  least  500,000  -  about  2.5  per  cent  of  the  popu   lation.   “Even  though  its  so  low,  they  are  so  vocal,  and  they  make  so  much  noise,”  Professor  Israeli  said.  “And  therefore  the  situation  has  to  be  checked  before  they  increase  their  num  bers,  because  don’t  forget  in  your  immediate  proximity  dwells  the  largest  or  most  populous  Islamic  country  in  the  world  [Indonesia],  and  by  necessity,  there  is  demographic  pressure   from  there  to  channel  the  suiplus  of  popula  tions  to  wherever  it’s  possible.   “And  one  of  the  big  possibilities  is  Aus  tralia,  so  they  will  continue  to  come  legally,  or  illegally,  and  settle  here,  and  when  they  get  to  the  rate  of  the  10  per  cent,  like  in  France,  then  you  will  see  life  will  become  untenable.”   He  said  France  might  already  be  at  the  “point  of  no  return”.  “Then  they  control  whole  sections  of  the  economy.  There  are  areas  in  France  where  you  cannot  be  elected  to  par  liament  without  the  support  of  the  Muslims.” ",2007-02-16

Among  the  antiquities  that  have  been  damaged  is  a  wall  that  is   believed  to  date  from  the  time  of  the   Second  Temple,  which  was  likely  part  of  the  Temple  courts,  according   The  Temple  Mount  In  Jerusalem...  anger  over  repair  work.

Larry  Marshall,  project  officer  from  Latrobe  University  which  organised  the  course  together  with  the  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria,  said  the  meeting  with  Block  and  Tisher  was  about  creating  dialogue  across  the  community.   “We  just  had  an  ordinary  dis  cussion,”  Marshall  told  the  AJN  of  the  meeting  with  Block  and  Tisher.  “It  was  more  about  sharing.”   As  well  as  touring  the  museum,  the  group  of  local  youngsters  also  stayed  at  the  Australian  Catholic  University  in  Sydney,  travelled  to   Canberra  to  meet  Mark  Coleridge,  the  Archbishop  of  Canberra,  and  spoke  with  politicians  and  mem  bers  of  the  media.   “The  aim  was  to  give  young  leaders  the  chance  to  access   people  who  have  control  over  important  issues,”  Marshall  said.

"  Visiting  Muslim  academic  defends  Israel’s  existence   YONI  BASHAN   A  V1S1J.1NG  Muslim  academic  from   Bangladesh  has  called  on  all  Muslims  to  accept  Israel’s  right  to  exist.   Associate  Professor  Ehsanul  Haque,  42,  made  the  remark  at  the  Australian  Association  of  Jewish  Studies  annual  conference  at  the  Uni  versity  of  Sydney’s  Mandelbaum   House  earlier  this  week.   Associate  Professor  Haque  -  whose  homeland  has  no  diplomatic  ties  with  the  Jewish  State  -  criticised  the  Bangladeshi  Government  for  being  “too  conservative”  and  rife  with  “extremists”.   The  academic,  who  openly  lauded  Israel’s  right  to  statehood  in  his  pres  entation  titled  “The  Jewish  leaders:  in  search  of  a  just  peace  with  the  Mus  lims”,  told  the  AJN:  “The  problem  is  that  Bangladesh  is  an  extremely  con  servative  society  and  people  are  largely  ignorant  about  other  religions.  So  that’s  why  misunderstandings  often  come  up  between  people.”   The  Australian  Association  of   Jewish  Studies  sponsored  Haque  to  fly   to  Australia  for  the  conference  after  he   submitted  his  paper  online.  He  volun  teered  to  speak  in  Australia  despite  the  inherent  risks  he  could  face  when  he   returns.   Bangladesh’s  is  the  third-largest  Muslim  nation  in  the  world  and  one  of  31  states  which  refuse  to  establish   diplomatic  ties  with  Israel.  In  the  past,  the  government  has  detained  Bangladesh  who  have  attempted  to  visit  the  Jewish  State.   A  fellow  countryman,  journalist  Salah  Uddin  Shoaib  Choudhury,  is  currently  facing  sedition  charges  for  attempting  to  visit  Israel  in  2003  for  a  conference.   He  was  reportedly  detained,  tor  tured*  and  kept  in  isolation  for  over  a   Associate  Professor   Ehsanul  Haque  in  Sydney  this  week  ...no   qualms  about  returning  to  Bangladesh,   which  has  not  established   diplomatic  ties  with  Israel.   year  under  suspicion  that  he  was  an   Israeli  spy.  Eventually  released,  he  was  later  assaulted  at  his  newspaper’s  office  by  members  of  the  Bangladesh  Nationalist  Party,  who  have  alleged  ties  with  Jemaah  Islamiah.  If  found  guilty  he  faces  the  death  penalty.   “A  lot  of  my  students   show  their  intolerance   toward  Jews  and  Israel.   I  So  I  thought  as  a  faculty   member  I  should  give  a  balanced  view  to   students  as  a  moral  responsibility'   EHSANUL  HAQUE  Associate  professor,  University  of  Dhaka   But  Associate  Professor  Haque  said  that  despite  his  outspoken  views,  he  has  no  qualms  about  returning  to  the  country  this  week.   “I  strongly  believe  that  what  I  feel  is   not  wrong.  A  gulf  of  misunder  standing  exists  between  the  Jews  and  the  Muslims.  And  there  are  moderate  Muslim  groups  as  well  who  always  speak  for  greater  harmony  and  coop   eration.”   A  lecturer  in  international  relations  at  the  University  of  Dhaka,  he  said  anti  Israel  rhetoric  dominated  academic   debate,  and  said  it  was  his  duty  to  bal  ance  his  students’  biased  perspective.   “A  lot  of  my  students  show  their  intolerance  toward  Jews  and  Israel.  So  I  thought  as  a  faculty  member  I  should  give  a  balanced  view  to  students  as  a  moral  responsibility.”   Acclaimed  international  scholars  at  the  two-day  conference  included  Islam  expert  Professor  Rah  Israeli  and  Holo  caust  scholar  Professor  Yehuda  Bauer.  The  conference  also  attracted  aca  demics  from  Germany,  Wales  and   New  York   The  event,  convened  by  Associate  Professor  Suzanne  Rutland,  has  taken  place  annually  for  the  past  19  years  and   will  be  held  at  Melbourne’s  Monash  University  2008.

"  Senate  passes  motion  to  free  pro-Israeli  Muslim   LEXI  LANDSMAN   THE  Australian  Senate  unani   mously  passed  a  motion  last  week  urging  the  Bangladeshi  Gov   ernment  to   “ensure  a  fair   trial  for  Muslim  journalist  Salah  Uddin  Shoaib  Choudhury  (pictured),  who  is  feeing  the  death  penalty  for  advocating  diplomatic  ties  with  Israel.   Senator  Ursula  Stephens,  from  the  Labor  Party,  moved  the  motion  after  being  contacted  by  Miriam  Jones,  an  executive  member  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies.   The  motion,  which  will  be  sent  to  Dhaka,  called  on  the  Bangladesh   Government  to  ensure  a  fair  trial   against  Choudhury  and  “investigate  those  responsible  for  his  harassment  and  intimidation  because  of  his  call  for  inter-feith  tolerance”.   Senator  Stephens  told  the  AJNthis  week:  “In  a  world  where  the  influence  of  religious  extremism  serves  to  divide  ordinary  citizens,  there  must  always  be  people  like  Shoaib  Choud  hury,  who  are  brave  enough  to  speak   out  about  that  influence  and  what  its   consequences  on  society  will  be.   “Choudhur/s  call  for  inter-faith  tolerance  has  resonance  far  beyond  the  country  of  Bangladesh.  It  is  a  message  that  is  as  relevant  today  in  Australia  as  it  is  in  many  European  countries,  Africa,  the  Middle  East  and  India.”   i“lf  Choudhury  is   sentenced  to  death,  it's  a  win  for  Islamic   j  fascism.  It’s  very   important  that  we  don’t   allow  that  to  happen.”   MIRIAM  JONES   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  Choudhury,  41,  the  editor  and  publisher  of  English-language  news  paper  The  Weeldy  Blitz,  was  arrested  in  November  2003  as  he  tried  to  board  a  plane  to  Israel,  which  has  no  diplomatic  ties  with  Bangladesh,  the  world’s  third  most  populous  Muslim  country.   He  was  tried  for  sedition,  blasphemy  and  treason.  He  was  released  on  bail  in  April  2005  and  a  few  months  later,  a  judge  ordered  the  case  continued  on  the  basis  that  Choudhury  had  “spoiled”   the  “image  of  Bangladesh”  and  “hurt  the  sentiments  of  Muslims”  by  his  positive  attitude  to  Jews  and  Chris   tians.   Jones,  who  played  a  key  role  in  gaining  the  support  of  the  Australian  Government,  said  she  was  “thrilled  that  something  was  being  done”.   With  one  week  until  the  trial  resumes,  Jones  urged  “the  Australian  Jewish  community  to  show  a  unified  voice  in  helping  free  Choudhury”.   “Now  is  crucial.  His  life  is  on  the  line  because  he  supports  Israel,  so  what  right  do  we  then  have  on  turn  ing  our  backs  on  him,”  she  said.  “I  see  this  man  as  the  key  in  the  long  term  war  on  fighting  terrorism  because  if  he  is  sentenced  to  death,  it’s  a  win  for  Islamic-fascism.  It’s  very  important  that  we  don’t  allow  that  to  happen.”   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  president  Grahame  Leonard,  who  has  been  in  contact  with  Alexander  Downer  over  the  issue,  said  he  was  pleased  the  motion  was  passed.   “We  need  to  show  solidarity  and  encourage  the  more  moderate  people  in  the  Muslim  world,  of  which  there  are  many,  to  speak  up,”  he  said.   Currently,  83  per  cent  of  Bangladeshis  are  Muslims. ",2007-03-09
"  Spirited  defence  of  Israel  -by  a  Muslim  refusenik   MODERN  Israel  is  a  “far  cry”  from  old  South  Africa,  wrote  Muslim  author  Irshad  Manji,  in  a  spirited  defence  of  the  Jewish  State  last  week.   It’s  absurd  to  apply  the  term  “apartheid”  to  one  of  the  most  progres  sive  states  in  the  world,  maintained  the  author  of  The  Trouble  with  Islam  Today:  A  Muslim’s  call  for  reform  in  her  faith.   Scathing  in  her  derision  of  Jimmy  Carter's  new  book,  Peace  Not  Apartheid,  she  wrote  in  the  Australian  last  Friday:  “In  a  state  practising  apartheid,  would  Arab  Muslim  legislators  wield  veto  power  over  anything?   “At  only  20  per  cent  of  the  popula  tion,  would  Arabs  even  be  eligible  for  election  if  they  squirmed  under  the  thumb  of  apartheid?   “Would  an  apartheid  state  extend  vot  ing  rights  to  women  and  the  poor  in  local  elections,  which  Israel  did  for  the  first  time  in  the  history  of  Palestinian  Arabs?”   “Would  an  apartheid  state  have  sev  eral  Arab  political  parties,  as  Israel   does?”  she  asked.   “Would  an  apartheid  state  award  its  top  literary  prize  to  an  Arab?”  the  Cana  dian  resident  asked,  referring  to  Emile   Habibi  in  1986.   “Would  an  apartheid  state  encourage  Hebrew-speaking  schoolchildren  to  learn  Arabic?  Would  road  signs  throughout  the  land  appear  in  both  languages?

But  she  was  not  without  criticism.  “I  condemn  its  illegal  Jewish  settlements  and  less  visible  crimes  such  as  the  diver  sion  of  water  away  from  Palestinian   towns.   “These  contradictions  of  the  Israeli  state  should  be  exposed,  discussed,  even  pilloried.  And  they  are:  openly,  as  well  as  often.  So  there’s  little  point  in  deciding  whose  camp  is  the  paragon  of  vice  or   virtue.   “The  better  question  might  be:  who’s  willing  to  hear  what  they  don’t  want  to  hear?

"  Community   Yiddish  concert  strikes  a  chord  with   Muslim  diplomat   LEXi  LANDSMAN   ALL  walks  of  life,  a  multicultural  group  of  young  and  old,  packed  into  Hakoah  Club’s  Gold  Star  Room  last  Saturday  evening  to  see  Yiddish  singer  Fay  Sussman  perform.  And  in  a  rather  unlikely  set  of  events,  the  singer  -  with  her  Yiddish  lyrics  -  struck  a  chord  with  a  Muslim  diplomat  and  his  son.   Turkish  Deputy  Consul-General  Recep  Peker  and  his  son,  Eflatun  Peker,  were  among  avid  music  fans,  Holocaust  survivors  and  members  of  Swedish  and  Greek  communities  who  came  to  hear  Sussman’s  dynamic  voice.   Peker  told  the  AJN  that  he  enjoyed  the   Yiddish  music.   “We  are  looking  forward  to  going  to  her   next  concert,”  he  said.   The  consul  and  his  son  sat  next  to  Sussman’s  two  daughters  at  the  concert,  and  Sussman  told  the  AJN:  “The  14-year-old  boy   [Eflatun  Peker]  kept  raving  that  this  is  the  best  concert  they’ve  ever  heard.  They  didn’t  know  they  were  sitting  with  my  children.”   She  said  Peker  invited  her  family  to  his  home  for  a  traditional  Turkish  dinner.   Sussman,  who  often  collaborates  with  the  Sydney  Jewish  Museum,  said  the  presence  and  praise  of  the  Muslim  consul  and  his  son  was  “the  most  amazing  thing  that  ever  hap  pened”  to  her.   “The  most  important  thing  to  come  out  of  my  music  is  that  we  can  build  bridges  with  different  cultures  -  we  can  unite,  we  can  create  harmony,  peace  and  understanding  of  each  other,”  she  said.   Sussman’s  performance  included  tributes  to  Holocaust  survivors.  She  was  accompa  nied  by  pianist  Phil  Marks  and  violinist  Daniel  Weltlinger  and  the  Klezmer  Connection  band.

"  SYDNEY  OUTLET  SUPPLIES  MUSLIM  'DVDS  OF  HATE'    AJN  STAFF     AN  outfit  based  in  a  western  Sydney  suburb  is  a  prime  source  for  DVDs   that  contain  extremist  Islamic  ranti-  ngs  against  Jews,  women  and  “infi-  dels”,  the  AJN  has  learned.   Islam  1  Productions,  based  in  Minto,  NSW,  provides  an  online  serv-  ice  for  the  production  and  distribution   of  Muslim  fundamentalist  DVDs  that   featured  prominently  in  a  UK  docu-  mentary  program  aired  on  Britain’s   Channel  4  this  week.   The  documentary,  titled  Under-  cover  Mosques,  exposed  well-estab-  lished  British  mosques  -  including  London’s  Central  Mosque  -  that  are  selling  DVDs  predicting  the  mass  killing  of  world  Jewry  and  denigrating   women  and  “infidels”.   The  DVDs  -  produced  in  NSW   and  distributed  worldwide  -  include   sermons  by  Sydney-based  Sheikh  Feiz  Mohammad  and  lectures  given  in  Australia  by  American-born  Sheikh   Khalid  Yassin.   In  one  DVD,  titled  Signs  of  the  Hour,  Sheikh  Feiz  imitates  the  noise  of  a  pig  when  referring  to  the  Jewish  people,  who  he  says  will  be  killed  on   the  “day  of  judgment”.  In  another,  Sheikh  Yassin  speaks  of  the  “filth”  that  Christians  and  Jews  believe  in  (see  table,  page  4).   The  director  of  Islam  1  Produc-  tions,  Lebanese-born  Subi  Alshaik,  told  the  AJN  that  his  company  had  been  unaware  of  the  inflammatory  nature  of   some  of  the  DVDs  and  would  “remove  them  from  the  shelves”.   CONTINUED  ON  NEWS  4   SYDNEY  SHOP  SELLS  INCITEMENT   Documentary  uncovers  DVDs  of  hate   CONTINUED  FROM  NEWS  1     But  as  the  AJN  went  to  press,  the  DVDs  were  still  listed  on  the  website.  Alshaik  explained  that  this  was  due  to  the  feet  that  the  man  who  handles  the  company's  internet  posting  “was  away  on  holiday”.   Alshaik  said  that  most  of  the   DVDs  of  Muslim  clerics,  including  the  ones  by  Sheikhs  Feiz  and  Yassin,  were  taped  in  Australia.  Feiz  is  based  in  Liverpool,  NSW  and  Yassin  visited   Australia  in  2005.   Alshaik  claimed,  however,  that  in  many  cases  the  company  itself  did  not  monitor  the  contents  of  the  tapes  but  inscribed  them  directly  onto  the   DVDs.   “Obviously  we  do  not  agree  with   racist  statements.  We  are  not  out  to  defame  anyone.  We  realise  times  are  changing,”  Alshaik  said.   He  added  that  his  lecture-tapes  series  had  helped  to  establish  his   company  financially,  but  that  the  company  was  now  focusing  on  pro-  ducing-children’s  DVDs  which  teach  the  tenets  of  Islam  to  young  children,  and  had  no  interest  in  promoting  inflammatory  material.   Nonetheless,  Alshaik  accused  Channel  4  and  the  company  that  pro-  duced  the  documentary  of  taking  the  inflammatory  quotes  “out  of  context”  and  of  seeking  to  “defame  Islam”.  He  said  his  company  was  examining  legal  action  against  the  company  for  airing  portions  of  the  DVDs  without  secur-  ing  the  company’s  permission.   Contacted  by  the  AJN,  the  Aus-  tralian  Security  and  Intelligence  Organisation  refused  to  comment  on  the  program’s  findings,  describing  them  as  “operational  matters”.   Last  year,  the  Federal  Govern-  ment’s  Classification  Review  Board  (CRB)  banned  two  Islamic  books  for  inciting  suicide  bombing  and  terror-   ism.  It  was  the  first  time  the  CRB  had   banned  material  for  inciting  terror-  ism.  Race-hate  books  have  previously  been  sighted  at  bookshops  adjacent  to  mosques  in  the  Sydney  suburb  of  Lakemba  and  the  Melbourne  suburb  of  Brunswick.   The  documentary  contains  video  footage  secretly  filmed  in  British  mosques  over  a  period  of  12  months.  The  findings  of  the  documentary,   London’s  Central  Mosque  in  Regents  Park,  pictured  here  during  the  July  2005  mourning  and  prayers  for  the  victims  of  the  London  bus  bombings.  Now,  according  to  a  new  documentary,  they  are  selling  and  airing  hate  DVDs  and  sermons.  The  mosque  is  run  by  Dr  Al  Dubayan  -  an  accredited  Saudi  diplomat.   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   Photo:  AP/AAP     aired  in  Channel  4’s  Dispatches  series,  have  sparked  further  discussion  within  Britain  about  the  radicalisa-  tion  of  extreme  elements  within  the   country’s  Muslim  community,  which  was  highlighted  on  July  7,  2005,  as  a  group  of  home-grown  suicide  terror-  ists  killed  52  people  in  simultaneous  rush-hour  Underground  and  bus  bombings  in  London.   The  investigation  also  reveals  that  Saudi  Arabian  universities  are  recruit-  ing  young  western  Muslims  to  train  them  in  their  extreme  theology,  and  sending  them  back  to  the  West  to  spread  the  word.  And  the  Dispatches  reporter  discovers  that  British  Muslims  can  ask  for  fatwas  -   religious  rulings  -  direct  from  the  top  religious  leader  in  Saudi  Arabia,  the   Grand  Mufti.  The  program’s  under-  cover  reporters  taped  direct  broad-  casts  from  Saudi  Arabia  to  the  mosques  in  which  senior  Saudi  clerics  espoused  jihad  and  the  subjugation  of   women.  It  also  revealed  that  the  direc-   tor  of  London’s  Central  Mosque  in  Regents  Park  was  a  fully-fledged  Saudi  diplomat.   The  investigation  reveals  that  the  influence  of  Saudi  Arabian  Islam  -   Wahhabism  -  extends  beyond  the  walls  of  some  mosques  to  influential  organisations  that  advise  the  British  Government  on  inter-community  relations  and  prevention  of  terrorism.   It  should  be  noted  that  Foreign   Minister  Alexander  Downer  was  recently  involved  in  a  public  spat  with  the  Saudi  Arabian  Embassy  in  Can-   berra,  after  the  embassy  protested  Downer’s  claim  that  the  government  had  blocked  Saudi  funding  for  a  new  mosque  in  Adelaide.     “In  one  DVD,  titled  Signs  of  the  Hour,  Sheikh  Feiz  imitates  the  noise  of  a  pig  when  referring  to   the  Jewish  people,  who  he  says  will  be  killed  on  the  “day  of  judgement”.     The  roof  body  of  Muslims  in  Britain,  the  Muslim  Council  of  Britain  (MCB)  -  which  has  been  lauded  by  British  Prime  Minister   Tony  Blair  for  promoting  coexis-  tence  and  understanding  in  the  UK  -  has  accused  the  documentary’s  pro-  ducers  of  “a  clear  attempt  to  foment  sectarian  divisions  among  British  Muslims  and  misrepresent  some  leading  UK  Muslim  institutions”.   At  the  same  time,  the  MCB  urged  the  Muslim  community  “to  be  vigi-  lant  and  ensure  that  their  premises  are  not  allowed  to  be  abused  by  those  who  are  intent  on  pursuing  divisive  agendas.  Unacceptable  and  inflam-  matory  language  can  never  be  accepted  from  Muslim  speakers,  either  during  talks  or  on  recorded  DVDs,”  the  council  said.

"  MUSLIM-JEWISH  ACRIMONY     ISLAMIC  GROUP  BLASTS  JEWISH  LEADERS  AS  'HATEFUL  FORCES'   JASON  FRENKEL     A  RADICAL  Muslim  group  hoping  to  create  an  Islamic  superstate  has  lashed  out  at  Jewish  community  leaders  who  called  for  it  to  be  banned  last  week,  describing  them  as  “hateful  forces”  intent  on  destroying  social  cohesion.   Hizb  ut-Tahrir,  which  describes  Israel  as  an  illegal  state  that  will  never  be  accepted  by  Muslims,  also  vowed  to  push  ahead  with  a  contro-  versial  conference  promoting  the  establishment  of  an  Islamic  caliphate.   The  group,  which  is  banned  in  several  European  and  Muslim  countries,  remains  free  to  operate  in   Australia.   But  Bankstown  Council  in  Syd-  ney  has  cancelled  a  Hizb  ut-Tahrir  seminar  originally  scheduled  to  be  held  in  its  town  hall  on  January  27  following  claims  it  was  deceived  when  the  group  booked  the  venue   under  a  different  name.   In  response,  Hizb  ut-Tahrir  blamed  Anglican  and  Jewish  com-  munity  leaders  and  the  media  for  demonising  the  group,  complaining  that  a  coalition  of  hateful  forces  was  “determined  to  facilitate  the  means  for  the  offensive  against  Islam  and   Muslims”.   “The  comments  made  by  Mel-  bourne  Anglican  minister  Mark  Durie  and  the  statement  issued  by  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs   AIJAC  chairman  Mark  Leibler:  Hizb  ut  Tahrir  should  be  banned.     Council  (AIJAC)  are  but  indicators  upon  some  of  these  forces,”  the  group  wrote  on  its  website.   AIJAC,  the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  and  federal  MP  Michael  Danby  are  among  those  pushing  for  the  Federal  Govern-  ment  to  add  Hizb  ut-Tahrir  to  a  list   of  proscribed  terror  groups  which   includes  Hamas.   AIJAC  national  chairman  Mark   Leibler  said  there  was  nothing  to  be  gained  by  “making  a  huge  public  outcry”  over  the  group,  but  reiterated  his  call  for  Attorney-Gen-  eral  Phillip  Ruddock  to  re-examine   Hizb  ut-Tahrir’s  status  in  Australia.   “One  would  hope  that  the  Federal  Government  will  be  looking  again  at  this  organisation  with  a  view  to  banning  it,”  Leibler  said.   “In  a  democracy  you  are  entitled  to  the  freedom  to  express  your  views,  provided  you  comply  with  the  law,  and  provided  you’re  not  engaged  in  the  incitement  of  vio-  lence  and  I  think  they’ve  crossed  that  boundary.”   Hizb  ut-Tahrir  promised  to  push  ahead  with  its  January  27  confer-  ence,  which  will  discuss  the  creation   of  an  Islamic  superstate,  or  caliphate,  despite  the  forced  change   of  venue.   The  council  said  it  had  been  unaware  of  Hizb  ut-Tahrir’s  involvement  in  the  conference  after  the  booking  was  made  under  the  name  Risala  Incorporated.   But  the  Islamic  group  said  previ-  ous  Hizb  ut-Tahrir  seminars  at  the   town  hall  had  all  been  booked  using   the  Risala  name.   “On  every  occasion  an  event  was  organised  under  Risala  Incorporated,  Bankstown  City   Council  was  informed  from  the  outset  that  the  event  was  a  Hizb  ut  Tahrir  lecture,  and  the  name  Risala  Incorporated  was  being  employed  as  an  administrative  tool,”  the  group  said  on  its  website.  -----------------------------------------------------   ajn.com.au  -  Have  your  say ",2007-01-19
"  ?   Interfaith  expert  ROSE  MCCONNELL  evaluates  the  ANU  Muslim  Association's  recent  Multi-Faith  Ramadan  Event.   Interfaith  Dialogues  are  notorious.  They  are  boring:  founded  upon  the  truistic  concept  of  gathering  people  of  different  beliefs  together  to  applaud  each  other  for  their  tolerance  and  pray  that  it  might  spread  to  the  world.  Those  who  are  not  tolerant  will  not  attend.  I  attended  the  interfaith  event  held  earlier  in  the  year  that  featured  the  Dalai  Lama.  His  visit  was  much  anticipated,  and  his  message  was  indeed  one  of  warmth.  Many   believers  and  non-believers  would  do  well  to  integrate  something  of  his  message  into  their  own  lives.  Yet  the  event  was  lacking.  I  was  left  feeling  unsatisfied;  why  should  we  be  gathering  together  to  hear  leaders  of  four  spiritual  traditions  express  tolerance  for  each  other's  beliefs?  Haven't  we  come  further  than  that?  Aren't  we  just  bowing  to  fundamentalism,  on  the  part  of  all  faiths,  giving  it  validity  in  reaffirming  that  the  message  of  violence   propagated  by  some  is  not  in  fact  the  message  of  love  endemic  to  religion?  Perhaps  I  am  being  overly  critical  of  the  event.  It  should  be  commended  for  the  opportunity  it  gave  many  to  hear  some  of  the  core  tenets  of  various  religions.  And  the  changing  attitude  to  religion,  particularly  in  this  country,  should  not  be  overlooked.  Many  are  now  running  from  religion  as  it  looses  its  apparent  relevance  and  appears  to  actually  harm  the  world.  Works  like  Richard  Dawkin's  The  God  Delusion  further  promote  the  idea  that  religion  is  responsible  for  more  harm  than  good.  Dialogue  may  well  be  the  only  way  to  allow  people  to  openly  question  how  they  see  religion  influencing  their  lives.  The  ANU  Muslim  Association  (ANUMA)  recently  held  its  own  'Multi-Faith  Ramadan  Event'.  Its   tag  line,  not  surprisingly,  was  peace,  love,  compassion.  The  event  departed  from  the  typical  interfaith  theme.  It  was  different  in  that  it  was  an  event  that  actually  had  a  point.  Ramadan  is  the  ninth  month  of  the  Islamic  calendar.  This  year  it  fell  between  the  13th  of  September  and  the  11th  of  October.  Ramadan  is  often  understood  by  non-Muslims  as  a  month-long  fast.  It  is  true  that  during  daylight  hours  in  Ramadan,   Muslims  should  abstain  from  eating,  drinking,  smoking  and  sex.  These  physical  aspects  are  only  one  part  of  Ramadan.  It  is  a  month  of  deep  religious  and  spiritual  reflection  and  worship.  Ramadan  was  the  month  in  which  the  Quran  was  revealed  and  fasting  during  this  month  is  an  opportunity  for  Muslims  to  learn  self-restraint.  (Qur'an  2:183,185)  This  year,  ANUMA   held  an  Iftaar  (dinner  that  follows  a  day  of  fasting)  on  campus.  It  was  jointly  hosted  by  the  ANU  Christian  and  Jewish  Students  Associations,  and  ANU  students  and  staff  of  all  faiths  were  invited  to  attend.  More  than  130  attended,  of  whom  around  40  were  non-  Muslims.  The  evening  began  with  the  Adhaan  (call  to  prayer)  and  the  opening  of  the  fast,  traditionally  done  with  water,  fruit  juices  and  dates.  Muslims  then  performed  evening  prayers  and  dinner  was  served.  The  keynote  address  of  the  evening  was  Archbishop  Mark  Coleridge.  He  spoke  of  the  challenges  faced  by  all  religions  to  find  peace,  arguing  peace  is  a  task...  not  just  a  matter  of  sitting  back  and  waiting  for  God  to  zap  us'.  He  stressed  that  religious  divisions  &amp;nbsp;   must  not  corrode  our  common  humanity,  'we  are  all  human  beings,  you  cut  me  and  I  bleed,  and  my  blood's  the  same  colour  as  yours.'  Yet  what  began  as  an  apolitical  reassertion  of  the  common  strive  for  love,  peace  and  tolerance,  quickly  became  a  moral  ear-bashing:  Australian  Muslims  have  become  the  'Other',  they  are  ghetto-dwellers  &amp;nbsp;  and  must  integrate.  He  questioned,  'will  this  minority  in  our  culture  use  its  freedoms  to  undermine  this   culture'.  This  final  statement  seemed  to  allude  to  threat  of  Muslims  becoming  terrorists.  His  next  comments  were  about  9/11.  Later,  Saba  Awan,  secretary  of  ANUMA,  acknowledged  that  she  was  saddened  and  annoyed  that  he  spoke  of  this.  She  reasoned  that  the  room  was  full  of  Muslims  celebrating  their  religion,  whereas  9/11  was  an  act  of  terrorists  stealing  religion.  Indeed,  it  seems  highly  inappropriate  for  a  leader  of  one  religion  to  chastise  followers  of  another.  This  was  a  Multi-Faith  &amp;nbsp;  event  through  which  ANU  Muslims  were  attempting  to  connect  with  non-Muslims.  And  they  were  forced  to  endure,  once  again,  being  told  that  they  were  a  threat  to  the  stability  of  this  country.   The  Archbishop  attempted  to  frame  his  comments  in  the  context  of  the  hardships  that  have  been  experienced  by  other  Diasporas.  He  spoke  of  the  historic  marginalisation  of  Jews  and  Catholics.  He  attempted  to  compare  these  experiences  saying  to  Muslims  'you're  not  on  your  own.  The  Jew  and  the  Catholic  have  known  it  [being  the  'Other].'  The  difference  that  made  his  comments  offensive  was  that  he  spoke  of  the   problems  of  Jews  and  Catholics  solely  in  the  context  of  what  other  people  had  done  to  them,  of  the  job  ads  that  said  'Catholics  need  not  apply'.  In  the  case  of  Muslims  though,  he  referred  to  terrorism  in  the  ranks.  His  failure  to  disconnect  the  experience  of  Australian  Muslims  living  in  the  ghettos,  disconnected  from  the  community  with  the  racism  they  experience,  among  other  difficulties,   was  only  highlighted  by  his  own  deferral  to  the  stereotypical  view  of  the  Muslim.  I  was  happy  to  see  that  Jack  Pinczewski  and  Abbas  Manafov,  Presidents  of  the  Jewish  and  Muslim  Associations  (respectively)  were  able  to  avoid  unhelpful  politicisation  of  a  religious  celebration.  Jack  expressed  his  delight  that  students  from  different  religious  faiths  were  gathering  together  to  share  a  meal,  and  asked  that  'tolerance  become  the  by-word  &amp;nbsp;  for  the  coming  years'.  Abbas  noted  that  'Islam  is  known  to  be  a  religion  of  tolerance'.  He  saw  the  event  as  a  success:  'we  show  everyone  that  we  an  get  together,  we  can  understand  each  other  and  we  can  work  for  humanity  in  respect  of  our  personal  views  and  beliefs.'

"  How  to  smother  your  friends  with  too  much  love   JOHNNY  BAKER  ^   The  JNF  strayed  from  its  own  mission  and  potentially  embarrassed  the  prime   minister  by  sponsoring  a  virulently  anti-Muslim  journalist.   For  a  people  blessed  with  so  much   brainpower,  we  Jews  are  sometimes  too   I  clever  by  half.   THERE  was  a  time  when  the   old-style  JNF  Blue  Box  occu  pied  a  position  of  prominence  in  our  home  and  our  lives.  It   was  passed  around  with  pride  at  my  parent’s  wedding  and  in  turn  at  my  own  bar  mitzvah  and  wedding.  It  rep  resented  all  that  was  good  and  noble  about  the  Zionist  enterprise.   True,  the  JNF  must  adapt  if  it  is  to  be  relevant  in  our  times.  Water  and  reforestation  strike  a  chord  that  is  broader  than  most  Jewish  causes  and,  on  these  issues,  the  JNF  is  a  certain  winner,  one  would  have  thought.  At  least  until  the  major  JNF  dinner  held  at  Melbourne’s  Crown  Palladium  last  week,  when  politics  was  the  order  of  the  day.   The  keynote  speaker,  Brigitte  Gabriel,  a  Lebanese  Christian  jour  nalist,  is  a  controversial  figure  whose  positions  were  well  known  to  the  organisers  of  the  JNF  function.  She  is  articulate  and  her  love  for  Israel  and   all  things  Jewish  is  palpably  genuine,   but  so  too  is  her  hate  of  the  Muslim  world.  Not  only  fundamentalism,  but  also  stereotypical  vitriol  about  Islam  as  an  inherent  force  for  evil.  Such  feel  ings  may  be  understandable  from  Gabriel’s  personal  experience,  but  they  are  not  a  worthy  sentiment  for  our  community  to  overtly  embrace  and  propagate.   Most  of  the  JNF  audience  greeted  Gabriel’s  address  with  a  standing  ova  tion.  Some  even  confessed  to  standing  and  applauding,  out  of  trepidation  they  would  be  “outed”  by  file  herd  mentality.  If  the  community’s  leader  ship  decided,  in  its  wisdom,  that  the  message  of  visiting  Professor  Rafael  Israeli  was  inappropriate  for  our  patronage,  then  kal  vachomer  (how  much  more  so)  that  of  a  presentation  which  made  Fox  News  look  like  a   John  Howard  receives  a  certificate  from  JNF   Victoria  president  Tom  Borsky  declaring  a  forest  named  in  the  PIVi's  honour  In  the  Negev.   Photo:  Sam   Okun/Progressive   Photography   mouthpiece  of  the  Democrats.   A  week  before  Shavuot,  we  should  have  been  a  little  truer  to  our  heritage:  more  engaged  in  tikkun  olam  (repair  ing  the  world)  than  sin’at  chinam  (needless  hate).  Worse  yet,  of  all  organisations  to  be  promoting  this  kind  of  message,  the  JNF  should  be  the  last.  Unlike  the  drift  to  the  right   within  some  of  our  communal  roof   bodies,  its  strength  lies  in  it  being  non-partisan  and  non-political.   ORST  of  all,  this  was  carried  out  in  the  presence  of  the  true  guest  of  honour  of  the  evening,  Prime  Minister  John  Howard.  Whatever  one’s  political  preferences,  Howard  is  deservedly  regarded  for  his  friendship  and  sup  port  of  Israel  and  the  Jewish  people.  His  acceptance  of  the  Jerusalem  Prize  was  yet  another  act  of  friendship  and  yes,  of  courage.  By  juxtaposing  him  with  a  strident  anti-Islamic  speech,  the  JNF  and  Zionist  movement  placed  him  in  a  potentially  embar  rassing  position.  It  was  a  misuse  if  not  an  abuse  of  our  special  relationship.   Recent  op-eds  in  the  Age  ought  to  remind  us  that  such  unequivocal  sup  port  from  the  Liberal  coalition  has  not  always  been  the  case.  Former  prime  minister  Malcolm  Fraser  is  fast  developing  into  Australia’s  answer  to  Jimmy  Carter.  He  places  Israel  at  the   core  of  all  the  troubles  in  the  Middle  East  and  argues,  “Israel  should  be  subject  to  stringent  nuclear  safeguard  arrangements  and  to  the  destruction  of  its  nuclear  arsenal”  (the  Age  22/5).   Yet  Fraser’s  views  are  moderate   when  compared  with  those  of  former  head  of  the  National  Party  and  deputy  prime  minister  Tim  Fischer.  He  fancifully  suggests  that  the  unre  solved  sinking  of  the  USS  Liberty  in  1967  proves  that  “Israel  will  push  over  the  edge  whenever  it  suits,  because  recent  history  shows  that  it  can  get  away  with  such  actions”  (the  Age  27/5).  If  Fischer  is  the  type  of  candi  date  being  mooted  as  Australia’s  first  president,  then  God  save  the  Queen.   The  current  Howard  leadership  is  indeed  a  “dream  team”  as  far  as  key  Jewish  issues  are  concerned.  But  whatever  the  outcome  of  the  next   election,  John  Howard  is  unlikely  to  be  prime  minister  in  two  years’  time.  Fortunately,  we  have  close  friends  on  either  side  of  the  political  spectrum.  Yet  they,  too,  need  to  be  treated  with  political  intelligence  and  sensitivity.  For  a  people  blessed  with  so  much  brainpower,  we  Jews  are  sometimes  too  clever  by  half.  Yes,  even  in  politics  you  can  sometimes  smother  your  friends  with  too  much  love.   What  is  the  lesson  of  all  this  for  our  community?  To  use  a  mixed  sporting  metaphor,  we  need  to  keep  it  simple;  get  back  to  basics;  pick  our  batdes  wisely  and  play  with  a  straight  bat  Let  the  JNF  focus  on  reforesta  tion;  the  UIA  on  refugees;  B’nai  B’rith  on  fraternity  and  the  Zionists  on  mainstream  Zionism.  And  let  our  col  lective  hasbara  efforts  be  sensitive  and  intelligent  in  articulating  the  real  issues  of  Jewish  concern.   Johnny  Baker  is  president  of  Australian  Friends  of  Yad  Vashem,  a  member  of  the   AIJAC  editorial  board  and  a  past   president  of  the  State  Zionist   Council  of  Victoria.

"  When  Australian  Jews  face  a  million  Muslims   VIEWPOINT   BILL  RUBINSTEIN   In  the  future,  the  incredible  growth  of  the  Muslim   community  in  Australia  will   present  a  significant  challenge  -  if  not  threat  -  to  the  Jewish  community.   The  presence  of  one  million  Muslims  in  a   country  with  (if  we  are  lucky)  only  150,000   Jews  will  necessarily  tilt  the  political  balance   sharply  against  the  Jews  and  Israel.   THE  controversy  aroused  by   Professor  Raphael  Israeli’s  suggestion  that  Muslim  immigration  to  Australia  be   curtailed  or  stopped  starkly  raises  the  question  of  whether  a  large  Muslim  population  in  Australia  poses  a  threat  to  the  Jewish  community.  For  the  past  11  years  I  have  lived  in  a  country  and  a  region  that  has  seen  an  enormous  Muslim  influx  and  where  Islamic  ter  rorism  is  a  daily  threat.  Is  Australia  likely  to  go  the  same  route,  and  what   should  be  done?   The  facts  are  these:  in  1971,  there  were  only  22,000  declared  Muslims  in  Aus  tralia.  According  to  the  2001  Census,  the  Muslim  population  had  grown  to  282,000  (many  other  sources  say  301,000),  an  astronomical  rate  of  increase.  Between  1996  and  2001  -  in   only  five  years  -  the  Muslim  population  of  Australia  increased  by  81,000,  nearly  the  same  as  the  entire  Jewish  popula  tion  of  Australia.  Sixty-five  per  cent  of  Australia’s  Muslims  are  under  40,  compared  with  only  45  per  cent  of  the  total  population;  only  36  per  cent  were  bom  in  Australia,  compared  with  73  per  cent  of  the  total  population.  The  Muslim  unemployment  rate  in  2001  was  9.5  per  cent,  nearly  double  the  national  rate  of  4.5  per  cent   The  most  important  challenge  to  the  Jewish  community  posed  by  these   facts  does  not  lie  in  the  current  situa  tion  but  in  future  trends:  the  Muslim  population  of  Australia  is  almost  cer  tain  to  increase  even  more  sharply  in  the  future,  and  it  will  be  interesting  to  see.  the  results  of  the  2006  Census  when  these  are  released.  Spurred  by  continuing  high  rates  of  immigration,  a  birth  rate  vastly  higher  than  the  national  average  and  some  conver  sions  to  Islam,  Muslim  numbers  here   are  very  likely  to  continue  to  grow.  Muslim  numbers  will  surely  reach  500.000  within  a  decade  or  two,  and  are  likely  to  reach  one  million  within  several  decades  (and  will  not  stop  there,  of  course).   There  is  nothing  automatically  wrong  with  an  Australian  Muslim  population  of  one  million.  The  main  challenge  -  many  would  say  threat  -  to  the  Jewish  community  is  that  the  pres   ence  of  one  million  Muslims  in  a   country  with  (if  we  are  lucky)  only  150.000  Jews  will  necessarily  tilt  the  political  balance  sharply  against  Jews  and  Israel.  Whom  does  anyone  think  the  Australian  Government  -  any  Aus  tralian  government  -  will  listen  to  about  the  Middle  East?  Does  anyone   think  that  the  Australian  Govern   ment’s  remarkable  record  of  support  for  Israel  would  continue,  given  these  demographic  realities?  One  million  Muslims  would  hold  the  political  bal  ance  in  20  or  more  parliamentary  seats   and  could  well  decide  dose  federal  and  state  elections.   THE  Jewish  community  has   always  been  able  to  compensate   for  its  small  numbers  -  there  are  perhaps  110,000  Jews  in  Australia,  0.5  per  cent  of  the  total  population  -  by  a  variety  of  means.  Because  of  their  very  high  levels  of  educational  and  occupa  tional  attainments,  Jews  are  extremely  over-represented  in  the  managerial  and  professional  upper-middle  dasses,  probably  comprising  about  five  per   cent  of  the  upper-middle  classes  of  Melbourne  and  Sydney.  Jewish  lobby  ing  efforts  have  normally  been  highly  effective,  marked  by  presentational  excellence,  a  well-funded  infrastruc  ture  and  unity  on  goals.  But  there  are  distinct  limits  to  these  advantages.  In  a  democracy,  numbers  count  above  everything  else,  and  it  is  only  to  be  expected  that  the  Muslim  community  will  develop  its  own  competent  lobby  ing  network.   Although  it  would  be  both  legally  impossible  and  unethical  to  ban  Mus  lim  immigration  to  Australia,  the  gov  ernment  might  well  consider  linking  the  number  of  any  nationality,  reli  gious  or  ethnic  group  permitted  to  migrate  to  Australia  to  the  socio-eco   nomic  and  educational  attainments  of   that  group  already  in  this  country  -  the  worse  they  do  here,  the  fewer  would  be  permitted  to  come,  and  vice  versa.  Groups  which  have  been  spectacularly  unsuccessful  here,  like  the  Lebanese  Muslims,  would  find  it  much  harder  to   migrate  in  future,  and  their  places  allotted  to  groups  like,  say,  the  Chinese  and  Vietnamese,  who  have  done  well  here  and  have  benefited  Australia.   Such  a  scheme  would  also  have  the   advantage  of  acting  as  a  spur  to  any  affected  community  and  its  leaders  to  lift  their  game.  Of  course,  much  flexi  bility  would  be  allowed  and,  of  course,  this  is  rough  justice.  But  no-one  has  a  right  to  migrate  to  Australia.  It  is  always  a  privilege,  one  that  migrants  should  strive  to  repay  with  compound   interest.   The  other  challenge  of  a  large  Mus  lim  population  is  file  direct  threat  posed  by  terrorism.  Plainly,  any  reasonable  governmental  efforts  to  identify,  punish,  and  exclude  potential  terrorists  should  be  strongly  supported  by  the  Jewish  community.

"  The  media  decides  what  terrorists  are  all  about   MATTERS   TZVI  FLEISCHER   In  trying  to  decipher  the   motivation  of  Muslim  terrorists,  the  media  tends  to  ignore  their  underlying  Islamist  ideology   and  to  highlight  their  supposed  ""grievances”  against  the  west.   HAT  motivates  Jihadist  terrorists  like  the  eight   health  care  workers   alleged  to  be  behind  the  unsuccessful  car  bombings  in  Britain  three  weeks  ago?  Many  in  the  media  think  they  know  -  grievances  about  Israel,  Iraq,  western  Middle  East  policy   and  the  situation  of  Muslims  in  the  west.  Journalists,  editors  and  com  mentators  try  to  imagine  what  could  drive  them  to  do  something  similarly  murderous,  using  their  own  western  cultural  sensibilities,  and  conclude  ter  rible  rage  or  despair  must  be  behind   such  acts.   It  is,  of  course,  possible  to  cite  claimed  grievances  by  terrorists.  But  this  requires  taking  these  claims  out  of  their  context  of  the  larger  justifications   asserted  for  terrorist  violence  -  which   are  primarily  about  the  rightful  place  of  Islam  in  the  world,  and  the  religious  obligation  of  Muslims  to  help  imple  ment  God’s  plans  for  the  creation  of  a  perfect  universal  Islamic  society.   Recently,  two  British  Muslims  who  are  former  activists  in  Jihadist  move  ments  provided  some  clarity  on  the   issue  of  terrorist  motivation.  Ed  Husain,  formerly  of  the  extremist   “I  remember  how  we   used  to  laugh  In   celebration  whenever  people  on  TV   proclaimed  that  the   sole  cause  for  Islamic   acts  of  terror  like  9/11,  the  Madrid  bombings  and  7/7  was  western  foreign  policy!'   HASSAN  BUTT  Former  British  jihadist   Hezb  ut-Tahrir  movement,  is  author  of  a  new  book  on  his  experiences.  Husain  told  Tony  Jones  on  ABC’s  Late  line  (5/7)  that  the  root  of  jihadist  vio  lence  is  “the  marrying  of  an  Islamist  ideology  set  up  in  the  1950s  in  Egypt  and  ...Wahhabism”  and  repeatedly  asserted  that  the  root  problem  is  “Islamism”  as  a  “political  ideology”.   Similarly,  Hassan  Butt,  a  former   member  of  ultra-radical  al-Muha   jiroun,  a  pro-al-Qaeda  group  in  Britain,  wrote  in  Britain’s  Observer  (1/7):  “I  remember  how  we  used  to  laugh  in  celebration  whenever  people  on  TV  proclaimed  that  the  sole  cause  for  Islamic  acts  of  terror  like  9/11,  the  Madrid  bombings  and  7/7  was   western  foreign  policy.  By  blaming  the  government  for  our  actions,  those  who  pushed  the  ‘Blair’s  bombs’  line  did  our  propaganda  work  for  us.  More  impor  tant,  they  also  helped  to  draw  away  any   critical  examination  from  the  real  engine  of  our  violence:  Islamic  theology.”   YET  for  some  in  the  media,  such   statements  cannot  erase  the  -  to  them  -  self-evident  belief  that   such  terrorism  directly  result  from  grievances.  The  worst  offender  has  been  the  Canberra  Times,  which  ran  piece  after  piece  making  this  argument  in  recent  weeks.  On  July  4,  the  paper  editorialised  (July  4)  that  the  bombing  attempts  showed  that  “the  resentment  felt  by  Muslims  of  Middle  Eastern  descent  about  western  interference  in  Arab  lands  is  as  acute  and  visceral  as  ever”.  Then  Australian  National  Uni  versity  academic  Clive  Williams  (6/7)  wrote  that  the  “driving  issues”  behind   terrorism  were  “Muslim  concerns”   about  the  “Palestinian  issue”  plus  British  “involvement  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan”  and  the  “civilian  casual  ties  in  all  three”.  Seamus  Milne  (7/7),  reprinted  from  the  Guardian,  said  it  was  “delusional”  to  deny  the  “central  link”  between  British  policy  in  the  Middle  East  and  terrorism  and  added,  “Given  Britain’s  role  in  the  Muslim   world,  the  surprise  must  be  that  there   haven’t  been  more  attacks.”   The  only  piece  the  paper  printed  that  did  not  ignore  the  Islamist  ideology  behind  such  attacks  was  by  Johann  Hari  of  Britain’s  Independent  (3/7).  Perhaps  because  he  is  active  in  gay  rights,  Hari  did  acknowledge  the  existence  of  a  “jihad  against  free  women,  gays  and  novelists,  as  well  as  a  war  against  occu  pation”  and  a  need  to  “unpick  the   jihadist  ideology”.  But  he  still  insisted   that  terrorism  is  also  “blowback”  for  “the  British  Government’s  invasion  of   Iraq  and  its  support  for  Israel”  and  argued  that  western  leaders  who  sup  ported  polices  he  condemned  should  be  “put  ...  on  trial”  to  “choke  off  the   more  obvious  blowback”.   In  the  same  camp  is  George  Negus  of  SBS-TV’s  Dateline,  but  this  self-pro  claimed  ant-Zionist  appears  to  ascribe  the  whole  problem  to  just  one  griev  ance-Israel.  Negus  asked  former  CIA  analyst  Michael  Scheuer  (11/7),  “Is  it  still  possible  that  after  all  this  time  that  the  so-called  Coalition  of  the  Willing,  and  its  leaders,  is  [sic]  still  missing  the  point  about  what  this  is  all  about,  that  it’s  ultimately  about  the  feet  that  the  sit   uation  in  the  Middle  East  -  Israel  and   the  occupied  territories  -  has  not  been  resolved?”  Scheuer  has  said  some  pretty  ugly  things  in  the  past  about  the  danger  of  the  ‘Jewish  lobby”  but  he  more  or  less  dismissed  Negus’  suggestion,  instead  blaming  western  support  for  “tyrannies  and  police  states”  in  the  region.   This  helps  explain  why  many  in  the  media  seem  so  unsympathetic  to   Israeli  counter-terrorism  efforts  and   the  problems  it  feces  in  dealing  with  an  unreconstructed  Islamist  terror  group  in  Hamas,  whose  very  raison  d’etre  is   eternal  violent  “resistance”  in  the  name   of  universal  religious  pretensions.  This  is  mainly  the  result  of  a  blind  spot   about  the  link  between  terrorism  and   ideology  rooted  in  a  larger  world  view.  Even  with  strong  evidence  that  it  is  leading  to  incorrect  conclusions,  it  can  be  very  hard  to  break  through  the  prism  this  world  view  engenders.

"  ENCOURAGING  HATE   NO  non-Muslim  nation  has  suffered  more  death  and  destruction  at  the   hands  of  Muslim  jihadists  than  India,  so  let  a  senior  Indian  say  the  last  word   on  the  evil  of  the  Islamic  clerics  who   motivate  and  encourage  the  “endless  jihad”,  throwing  a  cloak  of  spurious  holiness  over  its  criminality.   In  his  remarkable  book  Carpet  Wars,  Sydney  journalist  Christopher  Kremmer  quotes  KPS  Gill:  “All  fun  damentalist  creeds  preach  an  iden  tical  message  of  exclusion  and  hatred.  These  malignant  doctrines,  and  not  Islam,  motivate  the  fanatics  in  Pak  istan  and  their  supporters  elsewhere  for  what  they  call  the  jihad  in   Kashmir.  The  mullahs  of  Pakistan   have  reduced  the  teachings  of  one  of  the  great  religions  to  a  travesty,  brain  washing  young  men  to  commit  murder  and  to  die,  in  wayward  wars  on  foreign  soil.  But  this  blasphemous  creed  offends  against  all  religions”.   Our  Australian  radical  clerics  are  no  different  in  essence  from  the  Tal  iban  and  Pakistan  mullahs.

"  Hilaly  in  hot   water  over   Shoah  remark   YONI  BASHAN   CONTROVER  SIAL  Muslim  leader  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hilaly  (pictured)  has  angered  Jew  ish  groups  for  questioning  the   six  million  Jews  murdered  in  the   Holocaust,  despite  an  attempt  to  extend  his  hand  to  Jews  and  end  decades  of  animosity.   During  an  interview  with  Fair  fax  newspapers,  the  sheikh  pro  fessed  his  “respect”  for  Judaism,  saying,  “I  would  not  be  a  Muslim  unless  I  believed  in  and  respected  the  prophet  Moses,  peace  be  upon   him.”   But  when  questioned  about  the  Holocaust,  the  sheikh  stood  by  his  long-held  view  that  the  number  of  Jews  murdered  by  the  Nazis  had  been  exaggerated.   “I,  like  many  researchers  in  the  wprld,  shy  off  the  number  of  inno  cent  victims  that  had  been  esti  mated  at  six  million.”   The  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  branded  the  profile,  part  of  a  series  on  Islam’s  place  in  Australian  society,  a  “thinly  veiled  whitewash”,  rejecting  Sheikh  Hilaly’s  attempt  to  show  solidarity  with  the  Jewish  community.   “This  is  a  man  with  an   appalling  record  of  racist  remarks  stretching  over  two  decades  [and]  his  protestations  of  goodwill  therefore  fall  flat,”  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  told  the  AJN.   The  B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defama  tion  Commission  (ADC)  also  accused  the  sheik  of  staging  a  PR   stunt.   ADC  executive  officer  Manny  Waks  told  the  AJN:  “[He]  contin  ues  to  question  the  number  of  [victims]  murdered  in  the  Holo  caust,  demonstrating  his  immer   sion  in  antisemitic  rhetoric.”   Previously,  Sheikh  Hilaly  has  come  under  fire  for  allegedly  praising  Palestinian  suicide  bombers.   &amp;lt;  He  is  currently  being  ques  tioned  over  allegations  he  may   have  handed  funds  earmarked  for  Victims  of  the  Second  Lebanon  War  to  groups  that  support   terrorism.

"  Professor’s  words   .split  community   AJN  STAFF   PROFESSOR  Raphael  Israeli’s  (pic   tured)  comments  to  the  AJN  on  Muslim  immigration  to  Aus  tralia  have  sparked  lively  debate  in  the  community  and  cre  ated  a  visible  split  among  the  organisa   tions  sponsoring  him.   The  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  (AIJAC)  is  defending   its  decision  to  sever  ties  with  the  con   troversial  Islam  expert,  denying  it  bowed  to  pressure  from  Australia’s  Muslim  community,  and  NSW  Jew  ish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  has  branded  the  comments  “racist”.   But  Professor  Israeli’s  Australian   lecture  tour  is  going  ahead  as  planned,  and  Sydney’s  Shalom  Institute,  which  brought  Israeli  to  Australia,  as  well  as   the  Friends  of  Hebrew  University  and  the  State  Zionist  Council  of  Victoria  are  continuing  to  serve  as  sponsors  and  to  defend  Israeli’s  right  to  speak   The  AJN  itself  has  been  inundated  with  letters  on  the  Israeli  academic’s  explosive  warning  that  Muslim  immi  gration  posed  a  threat  to  social  cohe  sion  in  Australia,  with  sentiments  evenly  split  between  the  two  sides.  Israeli’s  first  lecture  in  his  six-week  course  on  “Understanding  Islam”,  held  Monday  night  at  the  Shalom  Institute  in  Sydney,  overflowed  with   attendees.   Professor  Israeli  himself,  mean  while,  has  lashed  out  at  Australian  Jew  ish  community  leaders  for  their  “shameful  submission  to  the  Muslim  thugs,”  and  blamed  the  “political  cor   rectness  that  does  not  allow  these   things  to  be  said,  though  privately  everyone  supports  what  I  said”.   CONTINUED  ON  NEWS   Community  split  by  remarks   CONTINUED  FROM  NEWS  1   Professor  Israeli  has  authored  20  books  on  Islamic,  Arabic  and  Chinese  affairs  and  is  considered  to  be  an  expert  in  Islamic  studies  at  the  Hebrew  University  in  Jerusalem.   In  an  interview  with  the  AJN  last  week,  he  said  Muslim  immigrants  had  a  reputation  for  manipulating  the  values  of  their  adopted  countries  and  said  Australia  should  limit  its  intake  of  Muslim  immigrants  to  protect  social  cohesion  and  national  security.   In  a  letter  published  in  today5s  AJN,  AIJAC  said  it  was  “completely  wrong55  to  single  out  all  Muslims  for  suspicion  or  negatively  stereotype  the  Muslim  community.   “We  remain  very  con  cerned  by  Professor  Israeli’s  implication  that  Muslim  minority  communities  as  a  whole  are  a  threat  or  danger,  and  we  strongly  reject  any   such  claim,”  AIJAC  said.   But  SZC  Victorian  presi  dent  Danny  Lamm  defended  the  scholar  and  said  the  lec  ture  series  would  go  ahead  as  planned.   “There’s  a  lot  of  support  for  him  being  a  valuable  guest  in  the  community,”  Lamm  said.  “He  has  been  our  guest  in  the  past,  he  gave  a  high  quality  lecture,  and  his  visit  was  very  much  appreciated.”   The  Shalom  Institute  said  it  rejected  any  form  of  racial  stereotyping  and  ethnic  quo  tas,  but  it  defended  the  repu  tation  and  expertise  of  its  scholar-in-residence.   “Our  scholars,  who  come  to  teach  adults,  are  chosen  on  their  academic  credentials   and  hold  a  diverse  range  of   views,”  CEO  Hilton  Immer  man  said  in  a  statement.  “Their  views  are  their  own  and  do  not  represent  those  of   The  Shalom  Institute.”   There  was  widespread   debate  this  week,  in  both  the  Jewish  and  general  communi  ties,  over  the  merits  of  Profes  sor  Israeli’s  comments.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  branded  Israeli’s  comments   “racist”  and  said  they  reflected  poorly  on  the  Jewish  commu  nity.   “We  thought  it  was  impor   tant  to  disassociate  ourselves   from  them  and  to  get  on  the  front  foot  quickly,”  he  said.   The  Board  of  Deputies  came  under  fire  from  one  of   its  members  at  a  plenum  on  Tuesday  night,  when  Otto  Waldman  claimed  the  collec   tive  knowledge  of  the  board  “would  not  equal  half  of  the  knowledge  Professor  Israeli   has  on  the  issues”.

"  J   Alarm  over  Hezbollah  claim   JASON  FRENKEL   ONE  of  Australia’s  most  prominent  Muslim  community  spokesmen  denies  terrorist  organisation  Hezbol  lah  is  trying  to  destroy  Israel.   Keysar  Trad,  the  chairman  of  the  Islamic  Friendship  Association  of  Australia  and  a  spokesman  for  Aus  tralia’s  Sunni  Muslims,  told  the  AJN  he  was  unaware  that  Hezbollah  had  ever  called  for  the  destruction  of  the  Jewish  State.   Jewish  leaders  have  expressed  con  cern  that  a  growing  number  of  local  clerics  and  Muslim  community  fig  ures  are  trying  to  legitimise  the  Iran  ian-backed  terror  network.   The  push  comes  amid  an  extraor   dinary  call  from  Arab  diplomats  for  the  Howard  Government  to  adopt  a  more  impartial  role  in  Middle  East  politics.   ‘There  is  no  solution  to   the  conflict  in  this   region  except  with  the  disappearance  of  Israel.""   SHEIKH  HASSAN  NASRALLAH   Hezbollah  leader   Hezbollah  has  made  no  secret  of   its  hostility  towards  Israel,  and  its  spiritual  head,  Sheikh  Hassan  Nasral   lah,  has  openly  called  for  her  to  be  wiped  off  the  map,  telling  a  Beirut  rally  in  1999  there  would  never  be  peace  in  the  Middle  East  while  Israel  still  existed.  ""There  is  no  solution  to   the  conflict  in  this  region  except  with  the  disappearance  of  Israel,”  Sheikh   Nasrallah  said.   In  addition  to  stating  his  refusal  to  acknowledge  Israel’s  existence,  the   Lebanon-based  leader  has  also  vilified   Jews,  calling  on  Jewish  people  world  wide  to  gather  in  Israel  and  “save  us  the  trouble  of  going  after  them”.   But  Trad,  a  self-appointed  spokesman  for  Australia’s  large  Sunni  community,  denied  Hezbollah  was   committed  to  Israel’s  destruction.   CONTINUED  ON  NEWS  10   Alarm  over  Hezbollah  claim   CONTINUED  FROEVi  NEWS  1   “I've  never  seen  anything  from  Hezbollah  that  calls  for  the  destruction  of  the  State  of  Israel,""Trad  said  this  week.  “I  think  peo  ple  should  be  very  careful  when  they  make  these  comments  to  verify  them  for  accuracy""   Sunni  Muslims  make  up  about  85  per  cent  of  Australia’s  Muslim  population,  which,  according  to  the  latest  Census  data,  numbers  about  340,000  people.   Trad  this  week  said  Australian  Sunnis  overwhelmingly  supported  comments  attributed  to  the  nation's  most  senior  Shi’a  cleric,  who  backed  Hezbollah  and  labelled  Israel  a  terrorist  state  in  a  recent  interview.   Hezbollah's  military  wing,  the  External  Security  Organisation,  is  banned  in  Aus  tralia  as  a  proscribed  terrorist  group.   But  like  Trad,  who  does  not  believe  Hezbollah  is  a  terrorist  outfit,  an  increas  ing  number  of  Australian  Muslim  leaders  are  publicly  stating  their  support  for  its  ongoing  campaign  against  Israel.   Sheikh  Kamal  Mousselmani,  the  head  of  the  Supreme  Islamic  Shi”a  Council  of  Australia,  declared  his  allegiance  to  Hezbollah  last  week  and  said  the  Aus  tralian  Government  was  encouraging  ter  rorism  by  supporting  Israel.   “Our  opinion  is  that  Hezbollah  is  not  a  terrorist  group.  We  consider  Hezbollah  a  resistance  group,”  the  cleric  ‘told  The  Weekend  Australian.   “Shi’a  in  Australia  consider  Israel  a  terrorist  organisation  and  also  view  those  who  support  Israel  in  the  same  light.”  .   In  a  further  worry  for  Jewish  leaders,  Sheikh  Mousselmani’s  attack  on  the  Howard  Government's  support  of  Israel  was  followed  by  an  extraordinary  call  from  Arab  diplomats  for  Australia  to  take  a  more  impartial  role  in  the  Israel-Pales  tine  conflict.   The  Australian  representatives  of  12  Arab  states  urged  Australia  to  be  more  even-handed  on  the  Middle  East  in  a  bid  to  counter  perceptions  Australia  blindly  followed  the  US  position  on  the  region,  The  Australian  reported.   “Australia  should  not  look  at  the  region  only  from  the  Israeli  point  of  view  but  from  the  point  of  view  of  22  Arab  countries  who  want  to  have  good  rela  tions  with  Australia  and  respect  its  friend  ship  with  Israel,”  Syrian  ambassador  Tammam  Sulaiman  told  the  newspaper.   Sheikh  Mousselmani  is  the  spiritual  leader  for  Australia’s  30,000  Shi’a  Mus   lims.  His  Sunni  counterpart,  the  new  mufti  of  Australia,  Sheikh  Fehmi  Naji  el-lmam,  has  also  downplayed  Hezbollah’s  mili  tancy,  calling  its  operatives  “freedom  fighters”  at  a  rally  last  year.   But  as  local  Muslim  leaders  denied  their  comments  would  radicalise  young  Australians,  Australian  embassy  officials  in  Lebanon  confirmed  that  Lebanese  security  forces  had  arrested  at  least  four  Australian  men  this  week  in  relation  to  terrorist  activities.   An  Australian  man  and  his  wife  are   also  believed  to  be  among  12  people  killed  during  fierce  fighting  between  the  Lebanese  Army  and  an  alleged  terrorist  cell  operating  in  Abu  Samra,  near  Tripoli.   I'Tve  never  seen  anything   from  Hezbollah  that   calls  for  the  destruction  of  the  State  of  Israel""   KEYSAR  TRAD   Islamic  Friendship  Association   of  Australia   Trad  told  the  AJN  it  was  unlikely  that  Australian  Muslims  would  travel  to  Lebanon  to  fight  against  Israel.   A  close  ally  of  the  controversial  former  Australian  mufti  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly,  it  is  unclear  how  much  support  Trad  retains  among  Australian  Muslims  to  speak  on  their  behalf  as  a  community  leader.   But  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  executive  director  Dr  Colin  Rubenstein  said  the  push  by  several  local  Muslim  leaders  to  legitimise  Hezbollah's  terror  activities  was  a  major  concern  for  Australian  Jews  and  the  wider  community.   “That  would  be  disturbing  for  all  Aus  tralians  who  would  understand  that  any  Australian,  whether  they  be  Sunnis  or  Shi’ites,  shouldn’t  be  supporting  an  organisation  whose  military  wing  is  pro  scribed  as  a  terrorist  organisation  in  this  country,”  Dr  Rubenstein  said.   The  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  described  the  leaders’  support  for  Hezbollah  as  deplorable,  warning  that  it  also  “endangers  local  community  harmony”.   “Hezbollah  is  a  voice  of  extremism,  murder  and  hate.  It  does  not  ask  for  a  two-state  solution  or  for  justice,  but  stri  dently  calls  for  genocide,""  ECAJ  executive  director  Geoffrey  Zygier  said. ",2007-06-29
"  •SI  (  •  M  L  .  .  -if  \  ffllllki   Every  night  at  the  Squarehouse,  during  the  month  of  Ramadhan,  more  than  a  hundred  Muslim  students  gather  to  pray,  break  fast  and  relax.  They  are  served  with  meals  from  different  parts  of  the  Muslim  world  -  Turkey,  Libya,  Southeast  Asia.  Many  are  international  students.  Nafis  from  Bangladesh  told  us  ""this  Ramadhan  has  been  my  first  away  from  home  and  soon  I'll  be  celebrating  my  first  Eid  abroad  as  well.  It  feels  a  bit  funny.""  Local  Muslims,  and  curious  onlookers  join  in  the  welcoming  and  goodhumoured  daily  ritual.  ""This  is  the  mosque,  for  most  of  us,""  said  Nazrul,  a  biology  student  from  Malaysia.  ""Otherwise  we  can  do  our  prayers  at  home,  but  it  is  nice  to  come  here.  If  I  can't  get  a  break  at  the  right  time  I  have  to  just  leave  class  for  five  minutes,  there  are  a  couple  of  places  I  know  where  I  can  pray  quiedy.""  Life,  for  many,  is  not  easy.  ""I  have  to  cook  my  own  meals,  do  normal  household  chores...and  most  importandy,  finish  uni  assignments.  I  do  pray  everyday,  but  five  times  is  very  rare.  To  those  who  manage  to  do  that,  in  spite  of  the  huge  workload  at  uni,  hats  off  to  them,""  said  Nafis.  The  facilities  at  the  Squarehouse  are  University  vintage:  lurid  carpet,  cast-off  CATS  tables  and  chairs,  flickering  neon  lights.  There's  nothing  particularly  dignified  about  it,  or  adapted  to  be  a  place  of  worship,  but  Islamic  Society  of  UNSW  counts  itself  lucky.  ""It's  clean,  and  it  has  plenty  of  space,  which  is  important  because  there  are  so  many  of  us.""  Compared  to  France,  a  country  with  a  much  higher  Muslim  population,  it  is  fair  to  say  that  they  are  lucky.  Aix-en-Provence  is  a  small  city  to  the  north  of  Marseille.  It  is  famous  for  its  lyrical  arts  festival  and  its  Provencal  regal  history,  contrasting  with  Marseille  which  has  a  strong  working  class  identity   and  is  thought  of  as  the  gateway  between  Europe  and  Africa.  When  the  Wallabies  play  in  Marseille,  they  stay  in  Aix-en-Provence.  Even  though  20%  of  the  population  of  Aix  is  Muslim,  there  is  no  Mosque  or  meeting  place.  International  Muslim  students  cram  into  the  basement  of  a  restaurant  in  the  centre  of  the  city  along  with  city  workers  on  Fridays.  Conditions  are  cramped  and  dangerous,  as  people  complete  their  prayers  in  corridors  and  even  on  the  street  outside.  Forten  years  theMuslim  population  have  been  trying  to  get  a  Mosque  built.  They  have  a  public  site,  the  plans  and  funds.  They  have  agreed  to  build  it  in  'provençal'  style:  no  minarets.  Successive  socialist  and  conservative  Governments  have  promised  to  approve  the  project,  only  to  recoil  after  the  election  citing  the  legal  ban  on  the  state  sponsoring  any  particular  religion.  Last  year  the  Gaullist  Mayor  Maryse  Joissains-Masini  followed  suit.  ""I  have  changed  my  mind  on  the  Mosque.  Until  the  Muslim  population  can  demonstrate  their  commitment  to  the  values  of  the  French  Republic,  they  will  get  no  support  from  me.""  A  member  ofher  staff,  of  Algerian  descent,  confided  with  regret,  ""she  has  given  up  on  the  Muslim  vote,  she  is  chasing  the  Front  National.""  Joining  in  festivities  with  ISOC  provides  a  good  chance  to  reflect  on  how  lucky  we  are  to  live  in  a  multicultural  society,  and  the  role  played  by  the  University  in  fostering  it.  ""My  experience  of  Australia  is  that  it  is  a  very  accepting  place.

"  BEST  BYTES   from  ajn.com.au   The  following  are  some  of  the  best  comments  posted  on  ajn.com.au  over  the  last  week.   ON  MUSLIM  IMMIGRATION   IF  the  majority  of  the  public  wants  a  10-year  moratorium  on  Muslim  immi  gration,  why  is  that  not  a  good  thing?  Those  who  say  a  moratorium  is  bad  must  believe  that  no  moratorium  is  the  majority  position  of  Australians.  Put  it  to  a  vote.  Majority  rules.  Isn’t  that  what  democracy  is  about?   JOHN  SOBIESKI   ON  JEWISH  DISSENT?   WHAT  is  it  with  people,  Jews  and  non  Jews  alike,  who  must  denigrate  their  own  when  living  in  a  free  and  affluent  society.   I  am  not  a  Jew  but  totally  support  Israel  and  her  right  to  exist.  As  many  others  have  stated,  if  the  Palestinians  cease-fire  this  minute  there  will  be  peace.  If  the  Jews  lay  down  their  arms  they  will  be  pieces.   I  hope  I  live  long  enough  to  see  Israel  able  to  lay  down  her  arms  for  good,  and  the  Palestinians  start  showing  that  they  are  worthy  of  the  trillions  to  date  squandered  on  them.   ROSEM   ON  THE  PALESTINIANS   I  THINK  we  do  live  in  a  parallel  uni  verse.  It  is  one  in  which  we  are  uncomfortable  supporting  the  oppres  sion  of  the  Palestinians  despite  their  violence  towards  Israelis.  It's  no  fun  being  an  oppressor.  It’s  probably  even  damaging  to  the  psyche.  Perhaps  that  accounts  for  fear  and  loathing  expressed  by  some  of  your  contribu  tors.

ON  MUSLIM  IMMIGRATION   I  CAN  only  see  disaster  coming  if  the  gov   ernments  do  not  take  action  to  limit  the  growth  of  fundamentalist  Islam  in  this  country.   I  am  amazed  at  the  attitude  of  the  Jewish  council  taking  a  politically  correct  stance  rather  than  a  proactive  one.  Have  they  no  recollection  of  history  where  a  passive  position  lead  to  destruction?   EMMET   THE  professor's  blunt  language  might  make  us  uncomfortable,  but  we  must  face  and  rationally  debate  the  issues  he  raises.  His  comments  disturb  us  because  they  confront  our  usually  unquestioned  assumptions  about  the  “success”  of  mul  ticulturalism.  But  can  we  just  keep  on  blindly  patting  ourselves  on  the  back  about  how  great  multiculturalism  is,  and  how  Muslims  will  integrate  just  like  Ital  ians,  etc?   It  may  sound  crude  to  talk  numbers,  but  modem  times  are  no  exception  to  the  basic  fact  throughout  history  -  demo  graphics  count  Europeans  are  already  discovering  that  with  France  having  it’s  own  simmering  low-level  ""intifada”  of  ""youths”  who  burn  cars  while  shouting  “Allah  Akbar”.  Let  us  not  just  try  to  con  vince  ourselves  that  everything  is  OK  and  Muslims  will  just  integrate.  The  message  of  the  imams  -  here  too  in  Australia  -  is:  do  not  integrate,  the  West  is  corrupt,  the  women  are  ‘cat  meat  etc  etc...  How  does  that  fit  with  the  “melting  pot'?  How  do  we  show  our  tolerance  by  tolerating  other  peoples’  intolerances?

"  Inter-faith   ties  will  ease  tensions   TALIA  KATZ   INTER-FAITH  initiatives  with  Jews  and  Christians  could  destroy  stereo  types  and  ease  the  pressure  felt  by  Muslim  communities  in  Sydney,  a  panel  of  academics  and  community   leaders  said  this  week.   Addressing  the  topic,  ""Muslims  in  Sydney  media”,  at  the  University  of  Sydney’s  Centre  for  Peace  and  Conflict  Studies  on  Monday,  the  panel  included  the  executive  direc  tor  of  the  Forum  on  Australia’s  Islamic  Relations  (FAIR),  Kuranda  Seyit,  Peter  Manning,  former  head  of  news  and  current  affairs  at  the  ABC  and  Seven  Network,  and  University  of  Technology  Sydney  (UTS)  Islamic  law  lecturer  Jamila  Hussain.   Manning,  who  also  lecturers  in  journalism  at  UTS,  told  the  group   that  inter-faith  initiatives  would  nor  malise  the  public  view  of  Muslims  and  Islam.   ""It  is  up  to  the  relevant  commu  nity  bodies  today  to  present  a  differ  ent  view  of  the  Muslim  communities.  Instead  of  ‘us’  against  ‘them’,  bringing  together  [the  monotheistic  faiths]  in  that  Abra  hamic  tradition  is  important,”  he  said.   He  identified  recent  events,  such  as  The  Arts  of  Islam  exhibition  at  the  Art  Gallery  of  NSW  and  last  week  end’s  Abraham  Conference,  as  vital  to  improving  understanding,  and  condemned  racial  profiling  in  major  Sydney  media  outlets.   “We  wouldn't  allow  it  for  Jews,  for  the  disabled,  for  Asians,  but  we  do  it  for  Muslims?""  he  asked.   Seyit  agreed  that  the  level  of  knowledge  about  Muslims  is  very  low  among  the  general  population.   “We  share  all  the  same  stories  as  Judaism  and  Christianity,  and  yet  Islam  is  just  that  little  bit  different.  The  turning  point  will  be  when  Aus  tralians  know  enough  about  the  reli  gion  to  relate,  but  not  many  know  enough  to  understand  it  fully,”  he   said.   The  seminar,  which  was  hosted  by  the  Centre  for  Peace  and  Conflict  Studies,  discussed  negative  portray  als  of  Muslims  and  Islam  in  the  Sydney  media. ",2007-08-24
"  Jews  boycott  Sheikh  Hilaly   JASON  FRENKEL   A  PLANNED  inter-faith  meeting  to  bring  Jewish,  Hindu  and  Muslim  religious  lead-  ers  together  descended  into  farce  this  week  after  an  appearance  by  controver-  sial  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly  sparked  a   walkout.   The  prayer  meeting,  held  in  Sydney’s  Hyde  Park  on  Tuesday  night,  was  intended  as  a  commemoration  of  the  life  of  Indian  leader  Mahatma  Gandhi.   But  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  inter-faith  chair  Josie  Lacey  and  Rev-  erend  Pravrajika  Ajayaprana  Mataji,  the  president  of  Hindu  organisation  Ramakr-  ishna  Sarda  Vedanta,  withdrew  from  the  meeting  after  learning  of  the  mufti’s  par-  ticipation.   The  controversial  cleric,  who  has  pre-  viously  cast  doubt  on  the  validity  of  the  Holocaust,  spoke  briefly  at  the  meeting  and  then  said  the  boycott  was  “an  indica-  tion  that  the  Jews  are  not  interested  in   reconciliation”.  But  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  said  the  group  had  decided  to  ""draw  a  line  in  the  sand”  over  Sheikh  Hilaly’s  participation.   “There  can  only  be  one  motivation  for  Holocaust  denial  and  that  is  anti-  semitism,""  he  said.  “We  do  not  engage  with  those  who  practise  it  and  we  will  not  engage  with  Sheikh  Hilaly.""   Rejecting  the  sheikh's  claim  that  the  Jewish  community  was  not  interested  in  the  inter-faith  process,  Alhadeff  said  Jews  worked  closely  with  moderate  sections  of  the  Muslim  community.   “The  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  is  extremely  active  in  inter-faith  work  and  expends  a  great  deal  of  energy  in  out-  reach  and  bridge-building.   “However,  we  draw  a  line  in  the  sand  at  Holocaust  deniers  and  those  who  pro-  mote  racial  division  and  engage  in  hate  speech,”  he  said.   “Sheikh  Hilaly  is  such  a  person.” ",2007-02-02

"  FUNDS  MAY  HAVE  REACHED  HF7R0II  AH   Hilaly  a  ‘growing  embarrassment’   YONI  BASHAN   JEWISH  groups  have  this  week  urged  the  Muslim  community  to  end  the  “growing  embarrassment”  of  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly,  following  revela   tions  that  funds  he  distributed  after  the  Israel-Hezbollah  war  may  have  ended  up  in  the  hands  of  terrorists.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Grahame  Leonard  said  questions  over  the  mufti’s  han  dling  of  charity  funds  raised  in  Aus  tralia  for  victims  of  last  year’s  war  was   more  bad  news  for  the  Muslim  com  munity.   “The  solution  lies  in  their  hands,”  Leonard  said.  “He’s  clearly  becoming  a  growing  embarrassment”   The  B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commission  (ADC),  the  Jewish  com  munity’s  antisemitism  watchdog,  also  urged  Muslims  to  distance  themselves  from  the  controversial  sheikh.   “If  the  sheikh  has  ...  handed  some   of  the  money  to  an  Islamist  terrorism  sympathiser  and  supporter,  that  would  be  very  grave  indeed,”  said  the  ADC’s  executive  officer,  Manny  Waks.   “Whether  or  not  these  allegations  are  accurate,  the  ADC  implores  the  Muslim  community  to  immediately  disassociate  itself  from  this  unholy   man.  With  his  consistent  anti  semitism,  anti-Australian  and  anti  western  views,  as  the  mufti  of  Australia,  Sheikh  Hilaly  is  smearing  the  entire  Muslim  community”   Earlier  this  week,  the  Australian  reported  that  Sheikh  Hilaly  had  been  tasked  with  distributing  $AU47,000  in  aid  money  -  raised  by  the  Lebanese  Muslim  Association  (LMA)  -  to  vic  tims  of  the  war.   It  was  later  revealed  $AU13,000  had  Men  into  the  hands  of  Bilal  Shaaban,   a  radio  broadcaster  with  alleged  ties  to  al-Qaeda,  while  the  remaining  funds  had  yet  to  be  accounted  for.   The  LMA  has  promised  to  repay  the  money  donated  to  Shaaban  and  is  threatening  to  cut  ties  with  Sheikh  Hilaly  if  he  doesn’t  produce  receipts.   Attorney-General  Philip  Ruddock  expressed  concern  this  week  that  some  of  the  funds  could  have  been  diverted  to  terrorist  groups  because  of  Sheikh  Hilaly1s  ties  with  Hezbollah.   The  Egyptian-born  self-described  mufti  is  understood  to  have  met  with   key  members  of  the  group  during  a  visit  to  South  Lebanon  in  2004,  and  praised  suicide  bombers  at  a  confer   ence  in  Beirut  in  2002.   A  former  member  of  the  Prime  Minister’s  Muslim  Advisory  commit  tee,  Mustapha  Kara-Ali,  told  the  AJN  this  week  that  the  missing  funds  may  have  ended  up  in  the  wrong  hands.   “[Sheikh]  Hilaly  is  clearly  in  con   tact  with  Hezbollah  in  Lebanon  -  he   met  them  in  2004,  publicly  at  the  Sidon  speech.   “He  was  given  $US38,000.  $US10,000  went  to  Bilal  Shaaban  with  links  to  al-Qaeda.  The  other  $US28,000  could  have  [gone  to  Hezbollah].”   Kara-Ali  claimed  he  has  personally  experienced  the  recruiting  efforts  of  Shabaan  while  on  vacation  in  Tripoli.   He  said  Shabaan’s  radio  station   wouldn’t  constitute  an  authentic  recip  ient  of  relief  aid.  “This  man  has  been   developing  a  profile  of  [former  deputy  head  of  al-Qaeda  Abu  Musab  al]  Zar  qawi  in  Lebanon  and  recruiting  people  to  go  and  fight  with  him  [in  Iraq].   “If  it  wasn’t  for  that  profile,  Hilaly  wouldn’t  give  him  that  money.”   Sheikh  Hilaly  is  overseas  and   unavailable  for  comment ",2007-04-06
"  UK:  Shoah  cut  from  curriculum   JONNY  PAUL   LONDON  -  Some  British  schools  are  dropping  the  Holocaust  from  history  les  sons  to  avoid  offending  Muslim  students,  a  government-sponsored  survey  has  revealed.   Teachers  are  afraid  to  confront  anti  semitism  and  Holocaust  denial  among  Muslim  pupils,  according  to  a  Historical  Association  survey  funded  by  the  Depart  ment  for  Education  and  Skills,  the  Daily  Mail  reported.   The  study  examined  “emotive  and  controversial”  history  teaching  in  schools.  Researchers  gave  an  example  of  a  high  school  in  the  north  of  England  that  dropped  the  Holocaust  as  a  subject  of  study.   The  report  went  on  to  say  that  in  another  department  at  the  school,  the  Holocaust  is  taught,  despite  antisemitic   sentiment  among  pupils.  The  same  department,  however,  avoids  teaching  the  Crusades  for  fear  of  “Muslim  rage”  since  their  ""balanced  treatment  of  the  topic  would  have  challenged  what  was  taught  in  some  local  mosques.”   The  report  said  some  schools  are  using  history  “as  a  vehicle  for  promoting  political  correctness”.   Karen  Pollock,  chief  executive  of  the  Holocaust  Educational  Trust,  said:  “It  is  our  understanding  that  this  is  not  repre  sentative  of  the  majority  of  schools  in  the  UK  and  that  the  case  in  question  was  just  one  example  brought  to  light  by  the  His  torical  Association.  However,  this  does  not  detract  from  the  seriousness  of  the  situa  tion,  and  highlights  that  more  sufficient  monitoring  of  how  Holocaust  education  is  taught  in  schools  is  needed.""

"  WHERE  WAS  RICHTER?   HIGH-PROFILE  Jewish  lawyer  Robert  Richter  QC  is  quick  to  advo   cate  and  offer  his  service  free  to  mem  bers  of  the  Arab  and  Muslim  community,  asylum  seekers,  refugees  and  alleged  Islamic  terror  suspects.  He  has  even  appeared  alongside  Antony  Loewenstein  to  support  the  human  rights  of  Palestinians.   The  father  of  kidnapped  Israeli   soldier  Shlomo  Goldwasser  has  been   in  Australia  looking  for  help  to  free  his  son  in  Lebanon.  Richter  has  very  close  relations  with  the  Arab/Muslim   community  and  could  have  used  his  influence  with  our  very  large  Lebanese  community  to  put  pressure  on  the  Lebanese  Government,  which  is  doing  nothing.   He  could  even  have  brought  it  to  the  attention  of  the  non-Jewish  com  munity.

"  Engage  Muslims  en  masse,  urges  visiting  world  Progressive  leader   PETER  KOHN   DIALOGUE  with  Muslim  groups,  rather  than  individual  figures,  is  needed  to  reinvigorate  ties  between  the  two  communities,  a  visiting  Progres  sive  leader  said  this  week.   World  Union  for  Progressive  Judaism  (WUPJ)  president  Rabbi  Uri  Regev  told  the  AJN  that  in  his  experi  ence,  engaging  high-profile  individ  uals  is  not  a  solution  to  inter-faith  dialogue  by  itself.   “What  I  think  should  receive  more  attention  globally  is  the  need  to  iden  tify  not  just  individuals  who  might  be  praiseworthy  but  quite  esoteric  and  without  any  constituency,  but  groups   that  share  basic  values  with  us  on  human  dignity,  peace  and   coexistence.   “Some  of  these  groups  might  be  weak,  endangered  or  persecuted,  but  regional  and  international  alliances  with  these  groups  may  empower  them  and  create  an  atmosphere  of  trust,”  he   said.   He  offered  Moscow-based  Mufti  Ravil  Gainutdin,  chair  of  the  Russian  Council  of  Muftis,  as  an  example  of  a  strong  and  moderate  figure  backed  by  a  powerful  constituency  with  whom  Rabbi  Regev  has  forged  a  growing  dia  logue.  He  said  visits  by  the  Russian  mufti  could  ease  tensions  in  other   Progressive  Rabbi  Uri  Regev...  empower   the  moderates.   countries  with  Muslim  communities.   Rabbi  Regev  is  visiting  Sydney  and  Melbourne  to  promote  fundraising  for  the  United  Israel  Appeal’s  (UIA’s)  Pro  gressive  Trust   “As  always,  it  enables  Progressive  Jews  to  support  the  UIA  and  support  Progressive  Jewish  projects  in  Israel  within  the  UIA-Jewish  Agency  frame  work,  including  resettlement  and  absorption  of  dim,”  he  explained.   He  also  aims  to  create  closer  bonds  between  Progressive  Jewish  communi  ties  in  Australia  and  others  around  the   world,  particularly  through  the  use  of  technology.   Australian  participation  in  Etgar,  a   year-long  study  program  for  members  of  Progressive  youth  movements  worldwide,  is  another  initiative  he  will  promote  to  local  Union  for  Progressive  Judaism  lay  leaders  and  rabbis.   “The  Netzer  Reform  Zionist  youth  programs,  seeded  in  Australia  and  South  Africa,  now  encompass  our  youth  and  young  adults  in  18  countries,”  he  said.   Rabbi  Regev  said  that  on  his  way  back  to  Israel,  he  plans  to  meet  with  leaders  of  a  new  Progressive  congre  gation  in  Bangkok.   In  Sydney  last  week,  Rabbi  Regev  met  with  UIA  Progressive  Trust  major  donors,  as  well  as  members  of  Temple  Emanuel  Woollahra  and  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel.  He  was  scheduled  to  address  the  Mel   bourne  Progressive  community  after  the  AJN  went  to  press.   In  2002,  Rabbi  Regev,  who  last  vis  ited  Australia  in  2004,  became  the  first  Israeli-born  head  of  the  WUPJ.  A  qualified  lawyer,  Rabbi  Regev  pre  viously  headed  the  Israel  Reform  Action  Centre,  which  brings  cases  involving  non-Orthodox  converts  before  Israel’s  High  Court. ",2007-03-02
"  LONDON  -  A  new  report  has  revealed  the  extent  of  extremist  penetration  of  mosques  and  other  key  institutions  of  the  British  Muslim  community.   The  report  is  by  Policy  Exchange,  the  UK’s  centre-right  think  tank  and  is  titled  The  Hijacking  of  British  Islam:  How  extremist  literature  is  subverting  Britain’s  mosques.  It  is  based  on  a  yearlong  investigation  by  researchers  into  the  availability  of  extremist  liter  ature  at  more  than  100  mosques  and   Islamic  centres.   The  report  discovered  that  most  of  the  extremist  literature  is  published  and  distributed  by  agencies  linked  to   the  Saudi  Arabian  Government.   In  addition,  some  of  the  leading  mosques  in  Britain  are  among  the  worst  offenders;  in  many  of  them,  it  is  openly  available.   Among  the  most  controversial   statements  found  in  the  literature  available  at  the  mosques  and  Islamic  centres  are  calls  for  violent  jihad.   Other  statements  unlikely  to  curry  favour  with  inter-faith  groups  have  included:  “The  Jews  and  the  Chris  tians  are  the  enemies  of  the  Muslim.”   Many  of  the  publications  encour  age  British  Muslims  to  segregate  themselves  from  non-Muslims.  So   called  unbelievers  are  to  be  treated  as  second-class  and  avoided  wherever  possible.   Among  the  literature  available  are  extracts  from  the  notorious  Protocols  of  the  Elders  of  Zion  (published  by  the  Saudi  Ministry  of  Education)  and  other  publications  peddling  bizarre  conspiracy  theories  alleging  that  birth  control  is  a  plot  against  Muslims  and  Arabs,  and  that  pornography  is  spread  as  part  of  a  Jewish  plot  to  cor  rupt  Muslims.   Director  of  Policy  Exchange  Anthony  Browne  said:  “It  is  clearly  intolerable  that  hate  literature  is  ped  dled  at  some  British  mosques.  I  am  sure  the  majority  of  moderate  Mus  lims  will  be  as  horrified  as  everyone  else  that  pamphlets  advocating  jihad  by  force,  hatred  for  insufficiently  observant  Muslims,  Christians  and  Jews,  and  segregation  have  found  their  way  into  the  UK’s  mosques.”   “The  feet  that  the  Saudi  regime  is  producing  extremist  propaganda  and  targeting  it  at  British  Muslims  must  also  be  challenged  by  our  own  government   “It  is  reassuring  that  the  majority  of  mosques  investigated  do  not  prop  agate  hate  literature,  but  much  work   Worshippers  at  London’s  Balt-ul-Futuh  mosque...  hate  literature  Is  being  peddled  at  some  British  mosques.  Photo:  AAP   needs  to  be  done  to  ensure  that  a  large  number  of  leading  Islamic  institu  tions  remove  this  sectarianism  from  their  midst.”   The  report  recommends  that  the  Saudi  Government  must  be  pressured  to  stop  distributing  extremist  litera  ture  in  the  UK  and  urges  mosques  and  Islamic  institutions  to  immedi  ately  remove  extremist  literature.   Furthermore,  the  authors  insist  that  “Islamic  schools  must  be  subject  to  clear  and  rigorous  regulation  and  made  part  of  a  genuinely  shared  sys   tem  of  national  education”  as  well  as   urging  all  authorities,  institutions  and  individuals  from  disassociating  them  selves  from  places  that  continue  to  distribute  the  extremist  literature.

"  JASON  FRENKEL   THE  B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commission  (ADC)  has  lashed  Aus  tralia’s  Muslim  community  for  throwing  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly  a  lifeline  as  the  nation’s  Islamic  spiri   tual  leader.   The  ADC  said  it  was  “bewildered”  by  the  weekend  decision  of  the  National  Board  of  Imams  (NBI)  to  grant  the  controversial  cleric  a  three  month  extension  of  his  role  as  mufti,  describing  him  as  a  bigot  who  was  unfit  to  lead  a  religious  institution.   The  (NBI)  has  set  up  a  committee   to  consult  with  Muslims  and  choose   a  replacement  for  Sheikh  Hilaly  by  the  middle  of  the  year.   The  Executive  Council  of  Aus   tralian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  said  that  it  was  encouraging  that  the  end  of  Sheikh  Hilal/s  tenure  appeared  to  be   imminent.   But  the  ADC  said  the  three   month  extension  was  “counterpro  ductive”,  a  view  backed  by  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  and  Opposi   tion  Leader  Kevin  Rudd.   “Though  largely  a  ceremonial  position,  this  decision  highlights  the  support  this  racist  and  anti-Aus  tralian  sheikh  has  among  the  Muslim  community,”  ADC  executive  officer  Manny  Waks  said.   “With  his  track  record,  Sheikh  Hilaly  is  not  fit  to  lead  any  religious   institution.”   Howard  said  the  council’s  deci   sion  was  at  loggerheads  with  com  munity  sentiment  and  would  have  an  “extremely  negative”  impact.   “They’re  exercising  their  right  -  it’s  not  our  power  or  right  to  appoint   Executive  officer  of  the  ADC  Manny   Walks:  “Sheikh  Hlialy  Is  not  fit  to  lead  any  religious  Institution.”   religious  leaders  -  but  I  think  they’re  doing  their  community  damage,”  the   PM  said.   “I  remain  very  strongly  of  the  view  that  they’re  very  much  out  of  touch  with  community  sentiment.”   Rudd  said  Muslim  leaders  had   made  a  mistake  by  extending  Sheikh  Hilal/s  term.   “Australia’s  Muslim  leadership  should  not  be  taking  any  decision  which  allows  someone  like  [Sheikh]  al-Hilaly,  who’s  gone  out  there  and  defended  pack  rapists,  to  remain  as  mufti  of  Australia,  even  if  it’s  for  another  three  months,”  Rudd  said.   ECAJ  president  Grahame  Leonard  said  Australian  Jews  would  welcome  Sheikh  Hilal/s  eventual  departure   from  national  affairs.   “The  important  thing  from  our  community’s  perspective  is  that  the  only  people  who  can  really  sort  it  out   are  the  leaders  of  the  Australian  Mus  lim  community,”  he  said.  “The  encouraging  thing  is  that  it  looks  like  that  is  going  to  happen.” ",2007-03-30
"  THE  International  Koran  Exhibition  hosted  in  Tehran  during  the  Muslim  holy  month  of  Ramadan  featured  a  unique  activity  for  its  visitors:  US  and  Israeli  flags  were  placed  on  the  floor  of  the  exhibition's  entryway,  forcing  those  who  visit  to  walk  over  them  on  their  way  in  -  symbolically  trampling  Iran's  enemies.   Using  flags  as  doormats  is  considered  a  small  protest  against  what  Iran  calls  the  ""big  devil”  and  the  ""little  devil”  -  the   former  being  the  US  and  the  latter  Israel.   Iran,  it  seems,  wants  to  use   the  exhibition  to  enhance  its  posi   tion  among  the  Islamic  nations  and'   maybe  even  solidify  its  status  as  their  leader.  In  order  to  do  that,  Iran  must  con  tinue  its  fight  against  those  considered  Islam’s  sworn  enemies  -  the  US  and   Israel.   YNETNEWS.COM ",2007-09-21

Inter-religious  dialogue  expert,  Rabbi  Dr  Dov  Maimon,  will  tackle  this  question  in  his  presentation.   “The  resentment  of  Muslims  against  Jews  and  Israel  is  on  the  rise.  In  Europe,  such  resentment  may  endanger  the  future  thriving  of  local  Jewries,”  he  told  the  AJN  this  week.  “Many  have  claimed  that  this  atti  tude  cannot  be  changed.  However,  hundreds  of  successful  projects  have  shown  concrete  results,  while  many   others  fail.”   Dr  Maimon,  who  is  an  ultra  Orthodox  rabbi  and  expert  in  Jewish  theology,  is  coming  from  Israel  for  the  three-day  Limmud-Oz  festival.   He  will  give  a  total  of  five  presen  tations  dealing  with  honouring  tra  dition;  the  future  of  the  Jewish  community;  medieval  Jewish-Sufi  mysticism  in  practice  and  future  predictions  of  the  Jewish  people  in  20  years.

I  Next  week,  the  SJM  will  host  a  '  panel  on  the  controversies  that  arise   from  religious  expressions  in  art,  '  under  the  auspices  of  the  Blake  Prize  &gt;  for  Religious  Art.   Some  of  the  entries  in  this  year’s  Blake  Prize  are  particularly  controver  sial,  notably  those  which  express  hatred  toward  other  religions.   Avril  Alba,  education  director  at  the  SJM,  said  the  event  would  “pro  vide  a  positive  public  forum  to  debate  religious  issues  that  are  reflected  in   the  entries”.   “The  prize  is  an  opportunity  to  go  beyond  the  headlines  and  look  at  the  connections  and  points  of  departure  between  religion  and  contemporary  political  issues,”  she  said.  “It  also  creates  a  greater  understanding  of  our  own  and  other  people’s  faith  visions,  and  the  artistic  expressions  of  those  traditions.”   The  chair  of  the  Blake  Prize,  Rev  erend  Rod  Pattenden  of  the  Uniting  Church  in  Sydney,  said  that  the  furore  over  the  competition’s  religious  theme  is  proof  that  “art  is  such  a  pow  erful  means  of  exploring  cultural  and  religious  difference”.   He  added  that  this  year’s  Blake   Isaac  and  Ishmael  by  Paul  Green  and  Homl  Vesal.   Prize  was  hitting  “a  real  nerve”.   “I  have  received  several  angry  phone  calls  from  people  claiming  reli  gious  allegiance  who  have  expressed   themselves  with  clear  hatred  and  vio  lence  towards  other  religious  groups,”  he  said.  “Art,  and  the  Blake  Prize  in  particular,  does  our  culture  a  service   when  it  can  make  us  aware  of  our   prejudices,  our  hatreds  and  the  intol   erance  that  sometimes  underlies  some  forms  of  belief.”   Shirley  Purdie,  who  is  from  the  Aboriginal  community  of  Warmun   in  Western  Australia,  won  the  prize  this  year.   The  Blake  Prize  for  Religious  Art,  which  was  founded  in  1951,  was  the  brainchild  of  Richard  Morley,  a  Jew  ish  businessman,  and  Michael  Scott,  a  Jesuit  educationalist.

"  Students  in  dose  encounter   JOSHUA  LEVI   IT  isn't  often  that  Jewish,  Christian  and  Muslim  teenagers  can  gather  together  to  hear  the  Koran,  discuss  the  way  to  put  on  tefillin  and  learn  about  the  Holy  Trinity,  but  that  is  the  forum  Youth  Encounters  offers.       Around  100  students  from  Moriah  College,  the  Emanuel  School,  Kincoppal  Rose  Bay  and  Sule  Col-  lege  spent  Sunday  in  dialogue  at  Youth  Encounters,  an  inter-faith  bridge-building  program  designed  by  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies.       One  of  the  students  from  Sule  College,  a  predominantly  Muslim  school  in  Preston,  had  the  Koran  recorded  on  an  mp3  player  with  an  English  translation  and  read  a  por-  tion,  while  a  Moriah  College  student  showed  the  students  how  he  puts  on   his  tefillin  and  explained  the  signifi-  cance  of  aligning  mind  and  heart  for  morning  prayers.       NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  chief  executive  Vic  Alhadeff  said:  “When  students  representing  faith  groups  interact,  the  exchange  empowers  them  to  articulate  their  beliefs,  to  develop  an  understanding  and  acceptance  of  differences  and  to  challenge  racism.  This  program  does  all  of  that  and  is  a  wonderful  antidote  to  racism.”       Youth  Encounters  was  conceived  in  2004  with  three  schools  —  one  from  each  Abrahamic  faith  —  and  60  students,  and  has  expanded  each  year.

"  LEADERS  RENEW  CALLS  TO  BAN  ISLAMIC  GROUP     JASON  FRENKEL     JEWISH  community  leaders  have   renewed  calls  for  the  Federal  Govern-   ment  to  ban  a  radical  Muslim  group  that  is  pushing  for  the  creation  of  an  Islamic  superstate.

But  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Afiairs  Council  national  chairman  Mark   Leibler  said  the  group  should  be  added  to  the  government’s  list  of  proscribed  terror  groups,  which  includes  Hamas  and  the  military  arm  of  Hezbollah.   “Hamas  and  Hezbollah  -  there  is  demonstrable  proof  that  they  are  ter-  rorists  and  they  are  committed  to  using  violent  means  to  achieve  their  objectives,”  Leibler  said.  “I  don’t  believe  this  organisation  [Hizb  ut-Tahrir]  is  much  better.  I  believe  that  they  ought  to  be  banned;  everything  they  stand  for  is  totally  the  antithesis  of  Australian   values  which  we  all  cherish.   “They  are  a  very,  very  dangerous  group  ...  I  hope  that  when  Federal   Government  authorities  review  some  of  that  material  they  will  come  to  the  conclusion  that  this  organisation  may  be  banned.”   Federal  Labor  MP  Michael  Danby  said  Attorney-General  Philip  Ruddock  should  “seriously  examine”  the  group’s   status  in  Australia.   “Apart  from  their  encouragement  of  anti-Jewish  violence  by  their  spokesman  in  Australia,  their  listing  in  Europe  as  a  terrorist  organisation  should  be  grounds  for  the  attorney  general  to  recommend  their  listing,”  Danby  said.   Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  president  Grahame  Leonard  said  he  was  concerned  at  the  group’s  promotional  material  for  the  Sydney  conference.  “From  what  we  can  see  from  their  advertisements  for  the  con-   ference,  it’s  all  about  inciting  racial  hatred  and  vilification,”  Leonard  said.   “It  arguably  goes  even  further  than  that  and  could  be  interpreted  as  seek-  ing  recruitment  to  terrorist  activities.   “The  way  it’s  been  portrayed,  it  is  certainly  not  the  sort  of  thing  you  would  expect  to  be  happening  in   Australia.” ",2007-01-12
"  Hilaly  gone,   cool  welcome  for  new  mufti   DAN  GOLDBERG  AND  W9EUSSA  SINGER   SHEIKH  Fehmi  Naji  el-Imam,  who  has  succeeded  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al  Hilaly  at  the  spiritual  helm  of  Aus  tralia’s  Muslim  community,  has  a  “chequered  past”  that  must  not  be  ignored,  Jewish  communal  leaders  cautioned  this  week  after  welcoming  the  change  of  leadership.   At  a  meeting  in  Melbourne  last  Sunday,  the  Australian  National   Imams  Council  elected  Sheikh   Fehmi,  the  79-year-old  imam  of  Mel  bourne’s  Preston  Mosque,  for  a  two  year  term  as  mufti  after  the  outspoken  Sheikh  Hilaly  “gracefully   declined”  an  offer  to  renew  his  tenure.   Jeremy  Jones,  head  of  community  affairs  for  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jew  ish  Affairs  Council  and  chair  of  the   Australian  National  Dialogue  of  Christians,  Muslims  and  Jews,  wel  comed  Sheikh  Hilal/s  departure,  but  said  the  Jewish  community  should  be  aware  of  Sheikh  Fehmi’s  history  of  pro-Hezbollah  sentiments  and  his  apparent  refusal  to  accept  Osama  bin  Laden’s  role  in  orchestrating  9/11.   “While  Sheikh  Fehmi  is  somebody  who  presents  a  more  moderate  and  conciliatory  face  most  of  the  time,  he  is  certainly  not  somebody  without  a  chequered  past   “We  have  to  know  with  whom  we’re  dealing  ...  [The  question  is  whether]  this  person  is  miles  away  from  Sheikh  Hilaly,  or  only  inches  away.”   At  the  height  of  last  year’s  Second  Lebanon  War,  Sheikh  Fehmi  appeared  at  a  pro-Hezbollah  rally  in  Melbourne,  which  inter-faith  pioneer  Rabbi  John  Levi  said  at  the  time  set  Muslim-Jewish  relations  back  a  decade.

Photo:  Peter  Haskin/A/N  file   the  Executive  Council  of  Australian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  said  that  while  Sheikh  Fehmi’s  past  was  of  concern,  “we  shouldn’t  condemn  him  yet,  but  we  must  be  mindful  of  what  we’re  get  ting”.   Block  said  he  expected  the  Jewish  community  to  gain  “more  of  a  hear  ing”  under  Sheikh  Fehmi,  who  emi  grated  from  Lebanon  in  1951.  He  said   issues  such  as  the  sale  of  Muslim  hate  books  could  be  better  addressed.   “We  will  have  greater  access  [to  the  %  mufti],  but  also  greater  responsibility  in  terms  of  dealing  with  issues.”   Rabbinical  Council  of  Victoria  president  Rabbi  Meir  Shlomo  Kluw  gant,  who  co-signed  a  statement  for  peace  with  Sheikh  Fehmi  and  Angli  can  Archbishop  Dennis  Hart  in  2004,  welcomed  the  appointment,  “albeit   with  some  reservation”.   “This  being  said,  my  personal  experience  with  him  ...  led  me  to  believe  that  the  comments  attributed  to  him  [about  Hezbollah]  were  not  necessarily  his  personal  beliefs.”   CONTINUED  ON  NEWS  7   The  former  mufti  and  his  spin-doctor...  the  controversial,  often  explosive,   remarks  attributed  to  Sheikh  Tajeddln  al-Hllaiy  (right)  were  often  dismissed  by  his  spokesperson,  KeysarTrad  (left),  as  misquoted  or  misinterpreted.   Photo:  AJN  file   Cool  welcome  for  new  mufti   CONTINUED  FROM  NEWS  1   Jones  said  Sheikh  Hilaly  would  be  remembered  as  a  “divisive  figure”  for  his  inflammatory  remarks  against  women,  Jews  and  Anglo   Australians.   Following  Sheikh  Hilal/s  antise  mitic  slur  at  the  University  of  Syd  ney  in  1988  that  Jews  are  the  cause  of  all  wars,  Jones  said  there  was  “no  prospect  of  [Sheikh  Hilaly]  con  tributing  positively  to  inter-faith  dialogue  [between  Muslims  and  Jews]”.   Since  then  he  has  regularly  raised  the  ire  of  the  Jews.  In  2004,  he  praised  suicide  bombers  while  visit  ing  a  mosque  in  Sidon,  and  was  accused  earlier  this  year  of  chan  nelling  money  raised  in  Australia  to  Hezbollah  fighters  in  Lebanon,  but  the  Federal  Police  later  cleared  him  of  any  wrongdoing.   And  last  July,  Sheikh  Hilaly  was  dumped  from  the  PM’s  Muslim  Community  Reference  Group  after  he  claimed  the  Holocaust  was  a  “Zionist  lie”.   Still,  Jones  said  inter-faith  rela  tions  had  progressed  greatly  despite  Sheikh  Hilaly’s  abysmal  track  record,  which  reached  rock  bottom  last  year  when  he  reportedly  said  women  who  dress  immodestly  invite  rape.   Sheikh  Fehmi  established  the   Islamic  Society  of  Victoria  in  1975.  In  2005,  he  was  invited  to  join  Prime  Minister  John  Howard’s   now-defunct  Muslim  Community  Reference  Group.   ajn.com.au  Podcast  of  interview  with   Jeremy  Jones ",2007-06-15

The  visit  is  part  of  an  initiative  launched  by  the  Simon  Wiesenthal  Centre  (SWC).   The  clerics,  who  represent  more  than  70  million  followers,  visited  the  rocket  battered  town  of  Sderot,  as  well  as  the  Western  Wall  in  the  Old  City  in  Jerusalem,  and  took  part  in  a  festive  Chanukah  candle-lighting  ceremony  with  yeshiva  students  in  Kiryat  Shmona.

Six  months  ago,  Cooper  also  participated  in  a  meeting  between  religious  clerics  and  victims  of  terror  from  all  faiths,  which  he  said  made  him  realise  the  importance  of  inter-faith  dialogue.   “These  are  religious  Muslim  clerics,  but  they  are  not  fanatics.  The  Muslim  community  is  immense  and  has  fol  lowers  from  all  walks  of  life.

"  HIS  WRETCHED  ROUTINES   I  WAS  particularly  perturbed  by  Antony  Loewenstein’s  assertion  that  “within  Judaism...  there’s  a  great  deal  of  anti-Muslim  feeling”.  He  cannot  mean  Judaism,  as  in  the  religion;  I’ve  searched  through  tomes  and  have  found  nil  reference.  I  skimmed  through,  knowing  full  well  that  all  our  sacred  texts,  of  course,  pre-date  Islam.  He  must  mean  that  Jews  have  antipathy  towards  Muslims.  Where’s  the  evidence,  Antony?  Oh!  You’ve  heard  a  few  remarks  here  and  there!   I  have  been  involved  in  two  major  Federal  Government-funded  projects  undertaken  to  foster  engagement  between  Jews  and  Muslims  in  which  hundreds  were  involved.  I  have  lis   tened  to  our  community  leaders,  to  our  pulpit  rabbis,  to  academics,  to  students  (young  and  younger),  to  the  Orthodox,  the  Progressive,  the  tradi  tional,  the  Humanists,  the  Yiddishists,  et  al.  I  can  state  without  equivocation  that  I  have  found  no  evidence  of   “anti-Muslim  feeling”,  let  alone  “a  great  deal”.   On  the  contrary,  it  is  demon  strably  clear  that  an  affinity  soon  arises  when  the  parallels  between  the  two  faiths  are  discovered.   Loewenstein’s  seder-night  ABC  TV  debut  may  not  have  been  watched  by  many  Jews;  I’m  hoping  that  not  many  Muslims  watched  it  either.  I’m  hoping  too,  that  the  wider  Australian  community  has  not  been  left  with  the  impression  that  Jews,  in  general,  have  a  great  deal  of  anti  Israel  feeling.

"  Professor  Israeli:  word  for  wore   In  the  wake  of  last  week’s  controversial  interview  with  Professor  Raphael  Israeli,  claims  have  been  made  that  he  was  “misquoted”  or  that  his  words  were  “taken  out  of  context”.  In  order  to  set  the  record  straight,  we  are  publishing  an  exact   transcript  of  the  relevant  parts  of  the  interview,  pertaining  to  Muslim  immigration,  as  conducted  by  AJN  reporter  JASON  FRENKEL   Professor  Israeli:  The  war  of  words   doesn’t  help.   You  have  to  infiltrate  all  those  circles   where  the  Muslim  radicals   operate,  to  arrest  them,  and  to  limit  immigration  into   western  countries  where  these  Muslims,  who  are  bent  on  destroying  western  civili  sation,  to  limit  immigration,  even  students  who  apply  to  come  from  Islamic  coun  tries  to  come  to  the  West,  and  they  very  often  stay,  sometimes  legally,  some  times  illegally,  and  these  are  the  people  who  ultimately  form  the  cells,  which  become  or  may  become  cells   of  terror.   So  there  is  a  whole  gamut   of  acts  or  actions  that  are  possible  in  order  to  check  this  threat  of  Islam.   AJNl  Sorry,  so  you  said  one  of  the  things  that  they   should  do  is  to  limit  immi  gration?   Professor  Israeli:  For  example,  in  France,  already  10  per  cent  of  the  popula  tion  is  Muslim,  and  maybe  there  it’s  already  at  the  point  of  no  return  -  what  can  they  do  with  six  million  people?  It’s  like  the  population  of  all   Israel  is  Arabs  in  France.   Then  they  control  whole  sections  of  the  economy,   there  are  areas  in  France  where  you  cannot  be  elected  to  parliament  without  the  support  of  the  Muslims,  and   so  on.   And  therefore,  by  increasing  their  numbers   they  start  to  have  an  impact  on  the  social,  economic,  political  and  cultural  nature  of  the  country.   AJN:  That’s  something  we  should  do  in  Australia,  do  you  think?   Professor  Israeli:  Absolutely.  Here  the  num  bers  (of  Muslims  in  Aus  tralia)  are  small.  I  don’t  have  the  exact  numbers  ...  so,  half  a  million  out  of  20  million  -  two  per  cent  or  one  per  cent  of  the  popula  tion  -  so  it’s  still  not  very  high.  But  even  though  it  is   When  they  get  to  the  rate  of  the  10  per  cent  like  in  France,  then  you  will  see  life  will  become  untenable”   PROFESSOR  RAPHAEL  ISRAEU   Islam  scholar   very  low,  they  are  so  vocal,  and  they  make  so  much  noise  and  so  on.  And  there  fore  the  situation  has  to  be   checked  before  they  increase  their  numbers,  because  don’t  forget,  in  your  immediate  proximity  dwells  the  largest  or  most  populous  Islamic  country  in  the  world,  and  by  neces  sity,  there  is  demographic  pressure  from  there  to  channel  the  surplus  of  pop   ulations  to  wherever  it’s  possible.   And  one  of  the  big  possi  bilities  is  Australia,  so  they  will  continue  to  come  legally,  or  illegally,  and  settle  here,  and  when  they  get  to  the  rate  of  the  10  per  cent  like  in  France,  then  you  will  see  life  will  become  untenable.   AJl\t  When  you  say   untenable,  what  do  you  see  in  your  crystal  ball?  What  do  you  mean  by  that?   Professor  Israeli:  Look  it  depends.  I  said,  first  of  all,  if  they  become  a  big,  major  minority,  for  example,  10  per  cent,  that’s  a  big  thing.  So  you  will  have  then  large  concentrations  of  Muslims,  so  it’s  not  thousands,  it  will  be  millions,  and  when  they  become  millions,  it’s  a  big   mass  where  individual  Mus   lims,  including  terrorists,  can  melt,  and  then  go  look   for  them.   In  England  they  already  have  that  problem  -  they  cannot  locate  them,  they   cannot  sort  them  out  from   the  general  population,  and  sometimes  you  have  to  impose  a  curfew  on  a  whole  area  to  catch  one  or  two  or   three  terrorists,  and  by  doing  that,  you  do  an  injustice  to  an  entire  population,  and  then  they  start  complaining  that  they  are  discriminated  against.   So  this  is  what  I’m  saying.  You  have  to  adopt  some  kind  of  preventative  policy.  In  order  not  to  get  there,  limit  the  immigration  and  there  fore  you  keep  them  a  mar  ginal  minority,  which  will  be  a  nuisance,  but  cannot  pose  a  threat  to  the  demographic  and  security  aspects  of  a  country.

"  NO  PROTECTION   THERE  are  some  m  the  wider  com   munity  who  oppose  following  the  lead  of  numerous  European,  Asian  and  Muslim  countries  in  proscribing  the  radical  Islamic  organisation  Hizb  ut-Tahrir  (HT).  For  instance,  Irfan  Yusuf,  well  known  in  the  Opinion  section  in  The  Australian,  strongly  argues  against  HT’s  proscription  and   describes  it  as  “the  closest  Muslim  thing  to  socialist  groups  congre  gating  on  our  campuses”.   Really?  HT  is,  in  fact,  an  extremist  organisation  dedicated  to  the  estab  lishment  of  an  Islamic  Caliphate  under  a  single  pan-Islamic  state  gov  erned  by  shari’a  laws.  Under  HT’s   draft  constitution  for  their  state,   jihad  is  compulsory  for  all  Muslims,  requiring  all  male  Muslims  over  15  to  undergo  military  conscription  in  order  to  be  prepared  for  religious   warfare.   Furthermore,  this  organisation’s   dismal  record  of  racism  and  incite  ment  to  violence  speaks  for  itself.  For  example,  HT  had  posted  on  their  website  a  quote  from  the  Koran  -  “kill  them  wherever  you  find  them”  -  followed  by  material  arguing  that  the  Jews  are  a  people  of  slander  and  treachery.   The  group’s  anti-Australian  views  are  similarly  well  known.  It  has  pub  licly  condemned  our  democratic,   tolerant  and  respectful  way  of  life.   That  HT  is  presently  marginalised  and  ineffectual,  as  some  have  argued,  is  not  the  point.  This  does  not  mean  it  will  not  mature,  particularly  in  a  world  of  networked  global  terror  where  HT  has  been  involved  in  numerous  violent  and  antisemitic   events.   Certainly  we  should  not  believe  that  a  show  of  heroic  tolerance  would  ensure  our  safety.  Whether  or   not  the  latest  incidences  of  the  detainment  of  medical  doctors  here   and  in  Britain  prove  to  be  legally  jus  tified,  we  can  no  longer  be  surprised  by  the  notion  that  educated  profes  sionals  with  bright  futures  are  capable  of  terrorism  against  their  fellow  citizens.  The  Australian  public  cannot  be  expected  to  extend  legal  protections  to  global  organisations   that  advocate  the  violent  overthrow  of  their  way  of  life.

"  Jews  and  Muslims  unite   LBQ  LANDSMAN   JEWS  and  Muslims  gathered  in  a  unique  celebration  of  a  religious  holiday  last  week.   Jews  for  Social  Action  (JSA)  hosted  40  guests  for  the  Muslim  fast  day  of  Ashura  at  North  Shore  Temple  Emanuel  last  week.   The  celebration  was  part  of  a  program  developed  by  the  JSA  and  Affinity  Intercultural  Foundation  (AIF)  to  encourage  dialogue  between  Muslims  and  Jews.   “Everyone  learned  so  much  about  the  similarities  in  the  way  in  which  Jews  and  Muslims  celebrate,”  JSA  chairman  John  Balint  said.   “We  have  fast  days  and  festivals  [as  they  do],  and  it’s  great  that  we  can  get  together  and  enjoy  them  together.”   Director  and  founding  member  of  AIF   and  member  of  the  Auburn  Gallipoli  Mosque  Mehmet  Saral  said  the  event  was  productive.   “It’s  all  about  the  shared  legacy  between  Jews  and  Muslims.  It  was  a  very  warm  envi  ronment,  we  discussed  all  topics  from  reli  gion  to  world  issues  -  it  was  a  bonding  experience,”  he  said.   He  added  that  celebrating  religious  festi  vals  together  encourages  “peace  at  home  and  peace  abroad”.   “In  today’s  climate  we  need  to,  as  people  of  faith  and  religion,  build  relationships  and  show  the  wider  Australian  community  that  Jews  and  Muslims  have  no  problems  get  ting  along.  We  want  to  show  the  cultural  aspects  of  our  faiths  and  put  that  to  the  fore.”   Following  the  day  of  Ashura,  it  is  tradi  tional  to  share  Ashure  -  also  known  as   lNoaii  5  puaaing  -  wun  neign  bours  and  friends.   Ashura  is  believed  to  be  derived  from  the  Jewish  Day  of  Atonement  and  the  name  is  also  thought  to  be  an  Arabic  form  of  the  Hebrew  word  asor  [the  10th].   Since  the  JSA’s  inception  in  2002,  it  has  worked  with  several  Muslim  communi  ties.   Hacer  Saral  (left)  and  Donna  Jacobs  Sife  enjoy  Noah’s  pudding. ",2007-02-16
"  World   Israel’s  neighbours  central   to  summit  success   ANALYSIS   LESLIE  SUSSER   JERUSALEM  -  As  the  peace  talks  rap  idly  approach,  some  of  the  Arab  and  Muslim  players  expected  to  play  a  key  role  in  creating  conditions  for  a  favourable  outcome  are  proving  to  be   more  of  an  obstacle  than  an  asset.   Egypt,  Syria  and  Turkey  -  each  in  its  own  way  -  are  complicating  efforts   to  hold  what  the  United  States  envi   sions  to  be  a  tipping  point  in  the  long-dormant  peace  process.   On  Tuesday,  one  of  those  nations  seemed  to  reverse  course:  Egypt  threw  its  support  behind  the  peace  confer  ence  after  Foreign  Minister  Ahmed  Aboul  Gheit  met  with  US  Secretary  of   State  Condoleezza  Rice.   Syria,  however,  has  proven  more  of  a  problem.  If  Annapolis  is  supposed  to  trigger  a  process  of  reconciliation   between  Israel  and  the  entire  Arab  world,  it  is  imperative  that  Syria   attends.   But  Syrian  President  Bashar  Assad  says  he  has  no  intention  of  coming  to  Maryland  unless  a  much  clearer  offer  of  a  deal  with  Israel  is  put  on  the   table.   Complicating  matters  further  are  strains  between  Israel  and  Turkey,  which  reportedly  is  trying  to  mediate  between  Jerusalem  and  Damascus.   The  difficulties  on  the  Palestinian  track  could  be  helped  by  a  Syrian  presence  in  Annapolis.  Although  Assad  says  he  has  yet  to  receive  a  seri  ous  offer,  he  went  to  Turkey  on  Tues  day  for  regional  talks  that  were  to   include  a  discussion  of  Israel.   Ironically,  some  Israelis  believe  the  chances  of  accommodation  with  Syria  are  greater  in  the  wake  of  the  reported  Israeli  air  strike  last  month  against  an  alleged  Syrian  nuclear  facility.  Top  Israel  Defence  Forces  generals  believe  there  now  is  a  real  chance  for  a  dialogue  with  Syria  and  Israel  should  explore  it.   As  important,  Israel  and  the  US   had  hoped  that  Egypt,  the  key  moder  ate  Sunni  nation  in  the  region,  would  encourage  the  Palestinians  and  other  regional  protagonists  to  make  peace  with  Israel  the  way  it  did  in  1979.   Instead,  Israeli  officials  have  been  complaining  that  Egypt  has  been  playing  a  negative  role,  turning  a  blind  eye  to  the  unimpeded  smug  gling  of  weapons  across  the  Egyptian  border  to  Hamas  militants  in  the  Gaza  Strip.   For  months,  tons  of  explosives  and  weapons  have  been  flooding  across   the  porous  Egyptian  border  with  Gaza,  Israeli  officials  say.   Before  the  Hamas  takeover  in  Gaza  in  June,  there  was  a  semblance  of  border  control.  Now,  Israel  says,  the  Egypt-Gaza  border  has  become  a  “smugglers’  highway”.   Rice  has  three  main  goals:  to  bring  Israelis  and  Palestinians  closer  to   agreement  on  a  statement  of  princi  ples,  to  impress  Israeli  Government  hardliners  of  the  need  to  go  forward,  and  to  get  Israel  and  Egypt  back  on   the  same  page.

Michelle  Jacobs,  28,  one  of  the  Jewish  SLD  members,  told  the  AJN  that  she  joined  the  group  for  its  important  focus  in  creating  an  opportunity  to  connect  with  different  cul  tures  and  change  misconceptions.   “It  is  people’s  lack  of  education,  awareness  and  interaction  with  other  people  that  ere   ates  hostility  and  discrimination,”  she  said.  “It  is  hoped  that  by  sitting  at  the  table,  dis  cussing  key  cultural  issues  concerning  Sydney,  we  can  educate  other  people  in  the  group  and  they  can  educate  us.”   Jacobs,  together  with  political  advisor  Anthony  Orkin,  29,  represented  the  Jewish  community  at  the  function  and  will  work  alongside  representatives  from  the  Christian  and  Muslim  faiths,  including  Mecca  Laalaa,  the  Australia’s  first  Muslim  surf  lifesaver.   The  Arts  of  Islam  exhibition  was  also  dis  played  at  the  function.   The  SLD,  which  was  formed  in  2006,  works  to  provide  a  forum  for  discussion  and  debate,  education  and  building  relationships  of  trust,  in  particular  between  Muslims  and  the  wider  community.

"  NEWS  BRIEFS   CLOSURE  40  YEARS  AFTER   DERANGED  AUSSIE’S  ATTACK   JERUSALEM  -  Muslim  clerics  unveiled  a  replica  last  week  of  an  ancient  pulpit  destroyed  when  a  deranged  Australian  set  fire  to  Jerusalem's  holiest  mosque  in  1969.   Clerics  unveiling  the  wood-and-ivory  replica  at  the  Al-Aqsa  Mosque  said  it  her  alded  the  ""liberation""  of  Jerusalem.  The  original  pulpit  was  believed  to  have  been  donated  by  Saladin,  the  medieval  Muslim  leader  who  ousted  the  crusaders.  It  was  destroyed  in  1969  when  Dennis  Rohan,  a  Christian,  set  fire  to  the  mosque  on  Jerusalem’s  Temple  Mount  Rohan  said  he  hoped  to  hasten  Jesus'  return.

"  Controversial  comments   PROFESSOR  Raphael  Israeli’s  controversial  comments  to  this  newspaper   last  week  about  Muslim  immigration  to  Australia  sparked  a  storm  of  scandal  and  debate  around  the  country.  Some  have  described  him  as  an  outspoken  academic  who  has  the  courage  of  his  convictions;  many  others  viewed  him  as  an  ill-advised  and  ill-informed  visitor  who  crossed  the  red  line  of  rampant  racism.  He  has  offended  many  Jews,  and,  we  assume,  most  Muslims.   For  the  record,  we  did  not  seek  out  the  professor  in  an  attempt  to  create  sensational  headlines.  On  the  contrary,  we  invited  him  to  be  interviewed  for  our  weekly  ""10  questions”  column,  in  which  we  conduct  an  in-depth  discus  sion  with  a  noted  figure  about  his  or  her  field  of  expertise.   It  was  only  in  the  course  of  our  interview  that  Professor  Israeli  launched  into  an  anti-Muslim  tirade.  As  our  transcript  published  in  this  week’s  edition  shows,  these  were  not  castaway  comments,  but  a  detailed  thesis  about  the  threat  Mus  lims  pose  to  the  West,  in  general,  and  to  Australia,  in  particular.   Unfortunately,  Professor  Israeli  and  some  of  his  defenders  chose  to  try  and  extricate  themselves  from  the  emerging  scandal  by  using  an  age-old  tactic,  claiming  that  he  had  been  misquoted,  misunderstood  or  otherwise  taken  out   of  context.   As  the  transcript  proves,  these  allegations  were  completely  unfounded.   THIS  newspaper,  in  principle,  rejects  Professor  Israeli’s  thesis.  We  do  not   subscribe  to  ethnic  profiling  or  mass  stereotyping.  As  a  people  who  have  been  stereotyped,  blackballed  and  expelled  from  countries  for  simply  being  Jewish,  we  should  be  acutely  aware  of  the  dangers  of  stereo  typing  others.   At  the  same  time,  we  do  not  blindly  adhere  to  “politically  correct”  narra  tive.  The  issue  of  Muslim  immigration  is  one  that  is  being  hotly  debated  around  the  globe,  especially  in  European  countries,  from  where  Professor  Israeli  draws  his  examples.   The  call  to  put  a  cap  on  Muslim  immigration  is  gaining  increasing  traction  in  the  political  discourse  of  European  countries,  out  in  the  open  sometimes,  and,  more  often,  behind  closed  doors,  in  the  corridors  of  power.   Nonetheless,  true  as  it  may  be  that  the  Muslim  community  has  within  its  ranks  a  radical  fringe  that  is  waging  war  on  the  West,  and  true  as  it  may  be  that  there  are  those  in  the  Australian  Muslim  community  who  threaten  our  society,  and  in  fact  threaten  us  Jews,  Professor  Israeli  is,  in  our  opinion,  wrong  to  deduce  that  Muslims  as  a  whole  should  be  limited  from  immigrating  to  this   country.   It  is  axiomatic  that  the  criteria  for  immigration  should  not  be  based  on  religion.  At  the  same  time,  it  would  be  foolhardy  and  negligent  to  ignore  the  reality  that  the  most  imminent  threat  today  to  western,  democratic  society   comes  from  the  ranks  of  radical  Islam.   The  solution,  therefore,  is  to  invest  energy  and  funds  in  screening  potential  immigrants,  to  make  sure  that  those  who  are  allowed  to  enter  this  country  do  not  espouse  extremist  ideologies,  do  not  repudiate  ""core  Australian  values”  and  do  not  support  the  use  of  violence  -  here,  there  or  anywhere,  including   the  Middle  East.   We  understand  the  prompt  decision  by  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  to  sever  ties  with  Professor  Israeli.  AIJAC’s  critics  will  point  to  Pro  fessor  Israeli’s  invitation,  as  well  as  to  the  upcoming  visit  of  Melanie  Phillips,  the  controversial  author  of  Londonistan,  as  proof  of  the  organisation’s  neocon  servative,  right-wing  agenda.  In  its  defence,  AIJAC  will  argue,  with  merit,  that  it  brings  experts  here  to  engage  in  the  war  of  ideas,  and  to  counterbalance   much  of  the  anti-Israel  bias  that  exists  here.   But  AIJAC  would  be  well  advised  to  learn  the  lessons  of  this  imbroglio,  and  carefully  weigh  whom  it  invites  here  in  the  future  -  for  its  own  benefit  and  that  of  the  entire  Jewish  community.  The  same  can  be  said  for  the  Shalom  Insti  tute,  which  brought  Professor  Israeli  to  Sydney  as  a  scholar-in-residence  and  has  thus  far  stood  by  the  visiting  academic  by  claiming,  erroneously,  that  he  was  “misquoted”.   As  for  Professor  Israeli  himself,  he  would  be  well  advised  to  keep  some  of   his  more  controversial  observations  to  himself.  A  fine  line  sometimes  delin  eates  learned  discourse  from  unacceptable  remarks.  It  is  a  line  that  a  veteran  academic,  and  a  guest  at  that,  should  be  expected  not  to  cross.   Unfortunately,  Professor  Israeli’s  derogatory  remarks  after  the  fact  -  as  reported  in  this  week’s  edition  -  have  only  added  insult  to  injury.  His  obser  vations  on  the  integrity  and  fortitude  of  local  Jewish  leaders  and  organisations  indicate  that  he  has  not  learned  his  lesson,  has  failed  to  understand  the  envi  ronment  he  is  operating  in,  has  no  understanding  whatsoever  of  the  sensibil  ities  of  the  Australian  Jewish  community  and  is  abusing  the  traditionally  warm  Australian  hospitality  extended  to  him.   Under  these  circumstances,  it  might  be  wise  if  the  professor  and  his  hosts  reconsidered  the  value  and  wisdom  of  his  planned  six-week  stay  Down  Under. ",2007-02-23

"  Children’s  book  shows  two  sides  of  a  similar  story   Book  review   THE  CAVE  OF   RECONCILIATION   Pecki  Sherman  Wltonsky   Jewish  Publication   Society,  $22   Reviewed  by  Deborah  Stone   A  DOUBLE-SIDED  picture  book  aims  to   help  Muslim,  Jewish  and  Christian  chil  dren  find  their  common  heritage  through  stories  from  the  Bible  and  Koran.   The  Cave  of  Reconciliation  has  two  covers  and  two  forms  of  the  same  story  in  one  book.  Read  in  one  direction,  it  is  An  Abrahamic  Tale  drawn  from  the  Torah;  flipped  over,  it  has  the  same  picture,  but  a  different  subtitle,  An  Ibrahimic  Tale,  and  is  based  on  sources  in  the  Koran.   Both  stories  use  colourful  collage  pictures,  maps  and  descriptive  storytelling  to  retell  the  biblical  stories  of  Abraham/Ibrahim,  culmi   nating  in  the  burial  of  the  patriarch  at  the  Cave  of  Machpelah  (Tomb  of  the  Patriarchs),  known  to  Muslims  as  the  Ibrahimi  Mosque,  in  the  now  much-disputed  territory  of  Hebron.   Author  Pecki  Sherman  Witonsky  describes  the  book  as  “a  gift  in  the  service  of  healing  and  peace”.  She  was  inspired  to  create  it  after  being  asked  to  speak  about  the  story  of  Isaac  and  Ishmael  in  synagogue  on  Rosh  Hashanah  in  2001.   “At  the  time,  the  second  intifada  had  heated  up  and  bullets  were  flying  from  both  sides  of  Israel’s  borders  and  I  felt  very  uncomfortable  with  the  topic  I  had  been  assigned,”  she  said.   Published  by  the  Jewish  Publication  Society,  the  design  of  the  book  sets  up  a  clear  message  that  neither  version  of  the  story  takes  priority  over  the  other.  The  different  versions,  and  sometimes  contradictions,  in  the  stories  are  presented  as  different  tradi  tions  that  can  be  equally  read  and  respected.   While  Jewish  and  Christian  children  might  start  reading  in  one  direction  and  Muslim  chil   A  collage  illustration  of  Abraham  and  his  two  sons,  Isaac  and  Ishmael.   dren  in  the  other,  the  intention  is  that  they  lit  erally  meet  in  the  middle,  where  a  short  verti  cal  section  offers  shared  information.   Another  asset  of  the  book  is  the  ability  for  readers  of  either  tradition  to  compare  the  dif   ferent  versions  of  familiar  stories,  an  exercise  that  is  likely  to  be  educational  for  adults  as  well  as  children.   Jewish  readers,  familiar  with  the  story  in  which  God  asks  Abraham  to  sacrifice  Isaac,  will  be  interested  to  learn  that  in  the  Koran  it  is  Satan  -  posing  as  God  -  who  makes  the  demand  of  Ibrahim  and  that  he  is  asked  to  sacrifice  Ismail  (the  Arabic  version  of  Ishmael),  not  Isaac.   There  are  also  additional  stories  that  appear  in  one  version  only,  that  provide  a   new  perspective  on  the  characters.   One  of  the  challenges  for  Witonsky  was  the  fact  that  while  the  story  of  Abraham  is  a  key  narrative  in  the  Torah,  the  Ibrahimic  nar  rative  in  the  Koran  is  not  continuous  and  omits  many  details.  She  got  around  this  prob  lem  by  supplementing  the  Koranic  narrative  with  Jewish  biblical  sources  that  were  con  sistent  with  the  oral  Islamic  traditions.   The  book  has  received  widespread  endorsements  from  inter-faith  leaders.   Deborah  Stone  is  the  AJN's  literary  editor. ",2007-05-25
"  The  BBC:  a  good  role  model  gone  bad   Australian  media  draw   inspiration  from  the  BBC,   once  an  admired  bastion  of  professionalism,  which  has   now  succumbed  to  ‘big  truth’  journalism.   TZVI  FLEISCHER   EVERY  Shi’ite  Muslim  is  sup   posed  to  find  a  senior  deric  to  be  a  “source  of  emulation”,  a  model  for  one’s  behaviour.   Many  journalists,  editors  and  produc  ers  also  look  for  models  of  good  jour  nalism  to  emulate.  In  Australia,  probably  the  most  important  model   has  been  the  BBC.   Historically,  it  was  a  good  model  -  known  for  dispassion,  efforts  to  be  comprehensive  and  professional  pres  entation.  Unfortunately,  contemporary  BBC  coverage,  especially  of  the  Middle  East,  has  frequently  been  more  of  a  negative  model  -  how  not  to  do  profes  sional  dispassionate  journalism.  The  BBC  is  a  world  leader  in  “big  truth”  journalism,  where  the  journalist’s  job  is  to  select  material  and  tailor  language  to  “educate”  the  public  to  agree  with  an  overall  view,  assumed  to  be  true.   Jeremy  Bowen,  the  BBC’s  Middle  East  editor,  has  provided  some  recent  examples.  When  appointed  in  2005,  he  said  he  wanted  “to  help  bring  about  a  deeper  understanding  of  [Middle  East]  events  to  BBC  audiences”.   A  recent  leaked  memo  showed   what  he  means  by  “a  deeper  under  standing”.  Written  on  January  5,  it  explained  to  various  BBC  news  staff  what  was  happening  in  the  Middle  East,  and  by  implication,  what  the  BBC  should  be  helping  the  public  to   “understand”.  It  said:  “Palestinian   society,  which  used  to  draw  strength  from  resistance  to  the  occupation,  is  now  fragmenting.  The  reason  is  the  death  of  hope,  caused  by  a  cocktail  of  Israel’s  military  activities,  land  expro   priation  and  settlement  building  -  and  the  financial  sanctions  imposed  on  the  Hamas-led  government”   In  other  words,  in  addition  to  the  false  trope  of  describing  all  Palestinian  violence  as  “resistance  to  occupation”,  he  posits  that  inter-Palestinian  vio  lence  is  all  Israel’s  fault.  This  analysis  was  presented  to  BBC  employees  as  the  obvious  and  complete  truth,  not  just  one  interpretation.   Many  good  examples  can  be  found  in  the   work  of  Fairfax’s  Middle  East  correspondent,  Ed  O’Loughlin,  an  Irishman  who  has  repeatedly  produced  reporting   slanted  toward  his  own  view  in  various  ways.   A  report  Bowen  filed  on  January  19  on  BBC  Radio  4’s  Today  program   indicates  how  he  translates  his   assumptions  into  reporting.  The  report  was  entitled,  “What  is  the  solu   tion  to  the  conflict  between  Israel  and  the  Palestinians?”   In  the  introduction,  the  only  obsta  cle  to  peace  mentioned  was  whether  Israel  would  cede  enough  land  to  the   Palestinians  in  the  face  of  the  “settler  movement”.   The  report  was  all  about  how  Israel  is  allegedly  preventing,  perhaps  delib  erately,  a  two-state  solution  via  the  separation  barrier  and  the  settlements.  Terrorism  was  mentioned  only  in  passing  as  Israel’s  claimed  justification  for  the  barrier.  Hamas  rejectionism   was  not  mentioned  at  all.   Bowen  spoke  to  five  people  in  his  report  -  three  Palestinians  critical  of  Israel,  an  extreme  left-wing  Israeli  human-rights  lawyer  who  accused  Israel  of  practising  “apartheid”,  and  Israeli  Foreign  Ministry  spokesperson  Mark  Regev.  Regev  was  given  17  sec   onds  out  of  more  than  six  minutes  to   speak  only  on  whether  or  not  Israel  is  practising  “apartheid”.   WHAT  is  the  relevance  of  this   to  Australia?  Of  course,  SBS  -  and  to  a  lesser  extent  the  ABC  and  the  commercial  channels  -  use   BBC  footage  and  reports.  However,  it  is   more  than  that.   “Big  truth”  reporting  is  widespread   in  the  BBC  and  much  of  the  British  media.  It  is  common  here,  too  -  and  much  of  it  has  spread  from  Britain.   Many  good  examples  can  be  found  in  the  work  of  Fairfax’s  Middle  East  correspondent,  Ed  O’Loughlin,  an  Irishman  who  has  repeatedly  produced  reporting  slanted  toward  his  own  view  in  various  ways.  Lately,  that  view  seems  to  be  that  Hamas  is  getting  a  bum  rap.  Last  February,  he  responded  to  the  election  of  Hamas  with  a  long  feature  arguing,  essentially,  that  the  Israeli   Government  is  just  as  bad  as  Hamas.  In  recent  weeks,  he  has  included  a  number  of  half-truths  and  asides  sym  pathetic  to  Hamas  in  his  reports  on   the  Fatah-Iiamas  conflict.   On  December  23  (the  Age),  his  piece  contained  lots  of  language,  inter   viewees  and  selective  information   designed  to  make  Hamas’  case  that   Mahmoud  Abbas  and  “Fatah  leaders   are  allying  themselves  with  the  US  -  and  by  implication  Israel  -  to  starve  out  an  elected  Palestinian  govern  ment”,  and  Fatah  should  be  seen  as  a  “quisling  organisation”.   On  January  29  (the  Age,  SMH),  O’Loughlin  again  went  out  of  his  way  to  put  forward  Hamas’  case  that  Abbas  should  be  seen  as  an  American  and   Israeli  collaborator.  He  also  portrayed  Hamas  sympathetically,  saying,  “Hamas  has  been  unable  to  effectively  rule  most  of  the  Palestinian  Authority.   Most  of  its  lawmakers  from  the  West  Bank  and  East  Jerusalem  are  in  Israeli  prisons  and  the  economic  blockade  and  the  Israeli  closures  of  Gaza  and  West  Bank  checkpoints  have  left  it  unable  to  implement  promised  eco   nomic  and  administrative  reforms.”   The  Australian  media  needs  to   learn  that  despite  its  past  reputation,  the  BBC  is  no  longer  a  good  “source  of  emulation”,  while  journalism  in  the  contemporary  BBC  style,  such  as  much  of  O’Loughlin’s  work,  is  simply  bad  journalism.

"  qu   Rabbi  Jonathan  Magoriet   Inter-faith  activist/emeritus  Bible  professor   at  Leo  Baeck  College,  London   How  has  your  inter-faith  work  with  the  annual  Jewish-Christian  Muslim  student  conference  in  Bendorf,  Germany,  improved   relations  between  the  three  faiths?   We  have  between  80  and  100  people  each  year  and  it’s  been  going  now  for  35  years.  Most  of  the  people  who  come  will  have  some  sort  of  leadership  role  within  their  community.  All  rabbinical  students  at  Leo  Baeck  College,  as  part  of  their  training,  attend  the  conference  at  least  once.  There  are  Christian  theology  students,  there  are  Muslims.  The  Muslims  aren’t  organised  in  Europe  in  the  same  way  as  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  terms  of  colleges,  so  we  tend  to  find  community  workers,  social  workers,  people  who  have  a  leading  role  within  their  communities.  Over  the  past  30  years  or  so,  in  many  of  the  inter-faith  conferences  I’ve  gone  to,  I’ve  come  across  people  who  have  told  me  they  were  at  the  Bendorf  conference  and  have  gone  on  to  continue  this  work,  so  it  has  an  influence  on  individuals  and  is  seen  by  many  as  a  model  for  when  things  get  tough.   What  is  die  relevance  off  holding  this  conference  In  Germany,  with  all  tihe  historical  and  emodonal  baggage  this  carries  for  Jews?   The  reason  it  started  there  was  that  a  German  pastor  and  an  English  rabbi  (Lionel  Blue)  wondered  if  instead  of  just  brooding  about  the  past,  was  there  something  the  church  in  Germany  could  do  to  help  the  Jewish  people?  One  of  the  ideas  that  arose  was  that,  with  the  con  flict  in  the  Middle  East,  there  must  be  a  way  in  which  the  three  great  religions  can  offer  something  helpful.  So  why  can’t  the  church  medi  ate  and  provide  the  place  where  Jews  and  Muslims  could  meet?  When  the  three  faiths  meet,  they  each  have  a  different  agenda.  The  Jews  have  this  question  about  Germany,  the  Christians  are  looking  back  at  their  past,  and  for  Muslims,  it’s  neutral  territory,  but  they  have  prob  lems  with  their  role  as  a  minority  in  Europe.   You’ve  spoken  off  literary  ^  approaches  to  biblical  stud  ‘nraS,  ‘es  ^  you’ve  pioneered.   vH^  Can  you  explain  those?   When  I  started  studying   fl|  and  teaching  Bible  40  ^lpl|  years  ago,  the  main   stream  way  of  reading  the  Bible  was  “historical  critical”,  to  discover,  if  you  could,  the  origins  of  the  texts  that  were  edited  together  to  become  the  Bible.  It  was  almost  a  kind  of  debunking  of  the  Bible.  I  was  interested  in  the  final  text  we   have  in  front  of  us,  how  it   holds  together  ...  I   was  lucky  to   be  coming  in  at  the  begin  ning  of  this   new  trend   of  reading  the  book  as  literature,   je  Jews  fftians   Muslims.   have  this  question  about  Germany,  the  are  looking  back  at  their  past,   ..  they  have  problems  ...  as  a  minority.   of  trying  to  understand  better  through  the  Hebrew  the  interconnec  tions  in  the  language.   Do  you  see  a  common  thread  that  brings  together  your  inter-faith  work  and  your  biblical  studies?   I  do,  in  that  there’s  a  kind  of  principle  that  comes  under  the  word  “dialogue”.  In  dialogue  with  others,  you  want  to  try  to  see  the  world  through  their  eyes.  When  you  start  reading  Bible  as  a  dialogue  exercise,  your  interest  is  trying  to  get  inside  the  minds  of  the  composers  of  it.   Are  communal  relations  between  Jews  and  Muslims,  and  between  Islam  and  the  mainstream,  a  cultural  or  more  religious  issue?   It’s  a  mixture  of  the  two.  In  terms  of  Jews  and  Muslims,  everything  is  overshadowed  by  the  Middle  East,  by  the  Israel-Palestine  conflict,  which  makes  for  very  difficult  relations  on  one  level.  But  as  soon  as  Jews  and  Muslims  actually  get  together  and  talk,  we  find  we  have  so  much  in  common  in  terms  of  our  understanding  of  the  world,  of  our  status  as  a  minority,  of  our  traditions,  even  of  our  language.   How  can  we  combat  radical  Islam  through  inter-faith  work?   One  of  the  difficulties  is  that  people  who  go  into  dialogue  tend  to  be  people  who  want  to  meet  each  other,  while  those  who  are  radical  -  on  all  sides  -  feel  much  more  isolated  and  under  threat.  There  is  no  shortcut.  You  have  to  invest  in  the  relationships  you  build  with  the  moderates  because  they  are  the  bridge  to  the  more  radical.  Never  despair  of  not  reaching  them.   Has  Progressive  Judaism  played  a  special  role  in  inter-faith  understanding?   Part  of  the  remit  of  Progressive  Judaism  and  its  responsibility  is  to  be  the  interface  with  the  outside  world.  We  accept  more  easily  that  we  are  part  of  a  broader  society  and  culture  and  have  a  responsibility  towards  it.  Reform,  Progressive,  Liberal  Jews  are  more  open  to  the  encounter.  It’s  easier  for  us  to  meet  with  other  people  and  step  out  side  our  own  boundaries.  If  you  look  at  most  of  the  inter-faith  work,  the  pioneers  have  been  Progressive  Jews,  with  Orthodox  Jews  com  ing  along  subsequently  ...  Temple  Beth  Israel’s  Rabbi  John  Levi  is  a  good  example.  I’ve  known  him  for  30  years  and  have  always  admired  the  role  he’s  played  in  Australia  in  precisely  this  way.   What’s  been  the  most  significant  change  in  the  way  rabbis  are  being  trained  at  Leo  Baeck  College  in  the  past  couple  of  decades?   We’ve  been  able  to  enact  some  kind  of  what  I’d  call  quality  control  over  the  Progressive  Jewish  leadership  of  communities  in  Europe,  with  rabbis  taking  up  posts  not  only  in  the  UK,  but  in  France,  Germany,  Holland,  and  also  now  in  the  former  Soviet  Union.  Also,  I  think  we’ve  pioneered  new  ways  of  understanding  the  role  of  the  rabbi  and  the  need  to  support  rabbis  in  their  postgraduate  work.  Rabbis  tended  in  the  past  to  go  out  in  the  world  and  hope  they’d  sur  vive.  But  we’ve  created  rabbinic  in-service  training,  a  whole  range  of  support  systems  and  also  tried  to  learn  more  about  the  dynamics  of  congregational  life.   You  are  coming  to  Australia  as  the  Union  for  Progressive  Judaism  scholar-in-residence.  What  significance  does  this  have?   I’m  starting  in  New  Zealand  and  I’ll  be  visiting  Melbourne,  Sydney  and  Perth,  with  different  expectations  in  each  of  these  places.  Is  this  your  first  trip  to  Australia?   I  was  there  26  years  ago.  I  was  lecturing  and  my  wife  came  along  with  our  son,  who  was  then  two  years  old.

"  Dr  Wafa  Sultan  is  a  Syrian-born  Sunni  Muslim  who  lives  in  Los  Angeles.  Since  the  September  11   attacks,  she  has  become  an  outspoken  critic  of  Islam  and  has  described  today’s  political  stage  as  ‘a  battle  between  modernity  and  barbarism  which  Islam  will  lose'.  Time  magazine  last  year  named   her  as  one  of  100  people  whose  ‘power,  talent  or  moral  power  is  transforming  our  world’.  Reviled  in  some  Islamic  circles,  she  is  the  subject  of  two  ‘fatwahs’  (orders  for  her  to  be  killed).  During  her   discreet  visit,  she  attended  a  series  of  meetings  with  government,  Jewish  and  church  leaders.  She  gave  the  AJN  this  interview  before  leaving  Australia  earlier  this  week.   AJN:  What’s  the  purpose  of  your  visit  to  Australia?   DR  SULTAN:  I’m  here  to  spread  my  message  because  I  feel  morally  obligated  to  do  it.   AJN:  You  were  raised  in  a  traditional   Muslim  family  in  Syria.  At  what  point  did  you  experience  a  sea  change  in  your   outlook?   DR  SULTAN:  Now  when  I  look   back,  I  feel  that  everything  in  my  life  was  predetermined  for  me.  There  were  two  major  turning  points.  The   first  was  in  1978  when  I  witnessed  the   killing  of  my  teacher,  a  medical  lec  turer  at  the  University  of  Aleppo  by  the  Muslim  Brotherhood.  His  only  crime  was  he  belonged  to  the  Alawi  sect  which  the  Syrian  president  belonged  to.  They  couldn’t  get  close  to  the  president,  so  they  took  revenge  on  his  community.  I  was  22  and  the   sounds  of  the  bullets  and  the  shouts   of  “Allah  is  great”  are  still  dancing  at  the  back  of  my  heart,  of  my  mind.   AJN:  How  did  your  life  change  after  that?   DR  SULTAN:  From  that  point,  I  was  silent,  but  inside  me  there  was  a  big  storm.  My  husband  David  played  a  major  role  during  this  time  in  reforming  me.  He  began  to  question  his  belief  system  many  years  before  we  met.  [The  second  turning  point  was]  10  years  later,  when  I  immi  grated  to  the  United  States  as  a  trained  psychiatrist.  I  worked  in  psy  chiatric  research  programs  at  a  Cali  fornian  university.   AJN:  Your  activities  must  have  taken   a  personal  toll.  Are  there  members  of   your  family  who  are  against  you?   DR  SULTAN:  I  lost  most  of  my  Muslim  friends  and  [the  support  of]  most  of  my  family  members  too.  I  haven’t  talked  to  my  mother  in  years.  My  brother  now  considers  himself  my  biggest  enemy.   AJN:  Have  they  suffered  conse  quences  because  you  are  in  the  family?   DR  SULTAN:  I  have  eight  uncles,  their  ages  ranging  between  55  and  70.  I  heard  that  two  weeks  ago  they  took  them  all  for  investigation.  One  of   them  said  he  hadn’t  seen  me  since  I   was  three  years  old.   AJN:  Do  you  fear  for  your  safely?   DR  SULTAN:  I  love  what  Ameri   can  President  Harry  Truman  said  about  how  faith  [in  what  you  are  doing]  means  you  don’t  have  to  fear.   AJN:  Given  your  Syrian  upbringing,  what  did  you  initially  think  of  Jewish  people?   DR  SULTAN:  I  was  taught  that  every  evil  in  this  world  is  because  of  the  Jews.  Sometimes,  in  psychology,  when  you  label  someone,  they  believe  it.  But  when  I  got  to  meet  [Jews],  I  realised  they  didn’t  let  others  label   them.   AJN:  Do  you  remember  your  first  encounter  with  a  Jewish  person?   DR  SULTAN:  In  1989,  during  my  first  week  in  the  United  States,  in  Hol  lywood,  my  husband  and  I  went  into   a  shoe  store.  The  salesman  looked  Middle  Eastern.  When  my  husband  asked  the  owner  where  he  was  from,  he  said  he  was  a  Jew  from  Israel.  I  felt  an  electric  pulse  ...  I  ran  from  the  shop  shoeless.  My  husband  followed   me  and  said:  “What  did  you  do?”  I  said:  “He  is  a  Jew!  Do  you  expect  me  to  shake  his  hand?”  I  was  shaking.  I  was  thanking  God  I  was  still  alive.   AJN'.  When  was  the  first  time  you  had  a  positive  feeling  about  meeting  a  Jew?   DR  SULTAN:  My  son’s  teacher  in   California  called  me  around  Christ   mas  time  and  said,  ‘I  know  you  are  a  Muslim  and  I  am  a  Jew  but  I  still  give  my  class  Christmas  gifts.  Do  you  mind  if  I  give  Nathan  a  Christmas  gift?”  When  I  heard  the  words,  “I  am  a  Jew”,  I  said  to  myself:  “What  bad  luck  for  my  poor  son  to  have  a  Jewish  teacher.”  I  told  my  children:  “You’re   Muslim.  She  wants  to  discriminate   against  us.  I  swear  to  God  I’m  going  to  watch  her  very  closely  and  any  thing  I  see,  I’m  going  to  report  to  the   school.”   But  she  proved  nothing  but  an  angel.  She  was  a  special  teacher  and  helped  my  hard-of-hearing  son.  Slowly  but  surely  over  time  I  started  to  back  up  and  take  a  look,  until  I  was  forced  by  [Jews]  to  face  the  truth  -  and  I  thank  them  for  that.   AJN:  You've  been  voted  by  Time  mag  azine  as  among  its  100  most  influential  figures  because  you  speak  up  about  Islamic  extremism.  What  do  you  think  holds  many  other  Muslims  back  from  speaking  out  and  saying,  “enough!”?   DR  SULTAN:  Fear.  Absolutely.  It’s  very,  very  dangerous.  You  have  to  be  ready  to  sacrifice  your  life.   AJN:  But  do  you  think  the  fear  is  alloyed  with  a  sense  of  apathy;  a  sense  among  many  Muslims  that  the  extrem  ists  have  some  degree  of  right  on  their  side,  so  why  speak  out  against  them?   DR  SULTAN:  Could  be  a  combi   nation.  I  was  told  by  many  Muslims:  “What’s  the  purpose?  Are  you  going  to  change  1.3  billion  Muslims?”  So  they’re  indifferent.  And  some  do  believe  in  the  [extremist]  teachings.   AJN:  Have  you  allied  yourself  with  others  who  speak  up?   DR  SULTAN:  Yes  I  have.  Egyptian  born  journalist  Noni  Darwish,  Somali  activist  Ayaan  Hirsi  Ali,   Lebanese-Christian  commentator   Brigitte  Gabriel...  we  have  the  same  mission,  maybe  with  different  approaches.   JUN:  Do  you  see  differences  in  the  degree  of  radicalism  displayed  by  Asian  Muslims  and  Wahabi  Muslims  of  the  Middle  East?   DR  SULTAN:  I  don’t  believe  there   is  something  called  Wahabi  Islam  and  radical  Islam.  There  is  only  one  Islam.   But  I  do  believe  there  are  differences  between  the  Arab  and  non-Arab   Muslims  in  terms  of  understanding  Islam.  Islam  is  a  purely  Arabic  reli  gion  and,  in  order  to  understand  and  practise  it,  you  need  to  read  and  write  in  Arabic.  That’s  why  I  believe  the  non-Arab  Muslims,  in  terms  of  their  knowledge  about  Islam,  are  not  as  deep  as  Arab  Muslims.   AJN:  You’ve  been  quoted  as  saying  you  believe  that  terrorism  is  not  the  prod  uct  of  radical  Islam  but  rather  that  there  is  some  sort  of  flaw  in  Islamic  theology.  Can  you  explain  that?   DR  SULTAN:  The  problem  is  deeply  rooted  in  Islamic  teachings.  I  believe  the  religion  has  hijacked  peo  ple,  not  the  other  way  around.   AJN:  If  you  look  at  Christianity  histor  ically,  it  underwent  a  reformation,  and  Judaism  had  its  enlightenment  Is  this  missing  in  Islam?   DR  SULTAN:  I  believe  both  reli   gions  [Christianity  and  Judaism]   have  room  for  it.  Islam  has  no  room  for  reformation.  It  is  absolute  and   you’re  dead  if  you  criticise  or  try  to  reform  it.  Islam  is  a  religion  and  a  political  ideology.  I  respect  the  reli  gious  part  but  the  two  are  mixed  and  you  must  accept  both.  The  political  part  speaks  of  the  caliphate  and  terri  torial  expansion.   AJN:  Can  there  be  reform?   DR  SULTAN:  It’s  going  to  be  a  very  slow  process  but  I  believe  it  has  already  started.  I  can  feel  it.  I  ask  very   well-known  writers  in  the  Arabic  world  ...  in  the  Arabic  media,  in  the  Arabic  street.  This  process  has  already  started.  But  it’s  going  to  take  a  few  generations.   AJN:  What  kind  of  structure  would  that  be?   DR  SULTAN:  I  am  trying  as  a  writer  to  build  a  value  system  for  Muslims  who  are  looking  for  a  change.  This  is  the  next  stage.  I  have  been  criticising  our  belief  system  ...  but  recently  I  felt,  “What’s  next?”.  You   have  to  fill  the  vacuum.   AJN:  Why  have  we  seen  this  outburst  of  Islamic  extremism  in  the  past  10-15  years  and  not  earlier?   DR  SULTAN:  I  personally  believe  because  of  Saudi  financial  power.  In  the  past,  they  didn’t  have  the  means  to   do  it.  But  in  the  past  20-30  years,  Saudi  money  has  infiltrated  every  spot  on  this  earth.   AJN'.  Has  the  war  on  terror  been   effective  as  a  military  campaign?   DR  SULTAN:  I’m  not  a  politician  or  an  army  expert.  I  believe...  it  has  to  be  a  psychological  war.   AJN:  Are  we  in  a  third  world  wai?   DR  SULTAN:  I  think  it’s  the   beginning  of  it.   AJN:  Are  westerners  apathetic?   DR  SULTAN:  Absolutely.  And   that’s  what  worries  me.  I  am  more   optimistic  when  I  receive  feedback  from  my  Arabic  Muslim  readers  than  from  people  in  the  West.  Muslims  are  sick  and  tired  and  looking  for  a  posi  tive  change.   AJN:  A  few  months  ago,  an  Israeli  academic,  Dr  Raphael  Israeli,  visited  Australia  and  suggested  that  Muslim  population  numbers  in  western  countries  should  be  capped.  What’s  your  view?   DR  SULTAN:  It’s  not  my  job  to  work  on  the  immigration  issue.  My  job  is  to  help  the  West  define  the  problem.  But  at  the  same  time,  every  body  has  to  be  careful  about  who  they   invite  to  live  with  them.  There’s  noth   ing  wrong  with  that.   AJN:  How  should  Australia  handle  extremist  comments  by  Islamic  commu  nity  leaders?   DR  SULTAN:  There  are  many  ways  to  react.  You  cannot  do  anything  before  you  educate  yourself  about  Islam.  Knowledge  is  power.  Once  you  have  knowledge,  you  can  face  these  individuals  and  question  them  and  inspect  what  they  are  saying  and  what  they  are  teaching  the  young  genera   tion.  British  commentator  Melanie   Phillips  once  said  we  can  solve  this  problem  in  two  ways.  The  negative  way  is  to  prevent  the  terrorists  from  reaching  their  goals.  The  positive  way  is  to  enforce  our  values.  You  have  to  say  to  them,  “If  you’re  not  here  to  respect  and  apply  my  values,  just  leave.”   AJN:  But  western  societies  by  their  very  nature  are  open  and  yielding.  Isn’t  that  a  problem  with  enforcing  a  rigid  set  of  values?   DR  SULTAN:  [Westerners]  have  to  be  reformed  too.  Your  way  of  think  ing  is  not  an  effective  way  to  protect  you.  It’s  a  very  fine  line  between  crushing  the  radical  terrorists  and  losing  your  identity  as  a  democratic  society  and  you  have  to  be  careful. ",2007-08-24

VILE  EPIDEMIC   SYDNEY’S  Sheikh  Feiz  Mohammed’s  recent  racist  antisemitic  diatribe,  refer-  ring  to  Jews  as  pigs,  has  simply  been  a  continuing  frightening  trend  among   sections  of  the  Muslim  community.   Another  local  Muslim  leader  and   Mufti  of  Australia,  Sheikh  Taj  el-Din  al-Hilaly,  has  also  long  been  an   unabashed  antisemite.   Similarly,  Muslim  organisations  in   Australia  such  as  Hizb  ut-Tahrir  and  Mission  Islam  have  also  been  promot-   ers  of  antisemitism.   While  the  ADC  acknowledges  that  some  in  the  Muslim  community  have  indeed  taken  an  uncompromising  stand  against  the  sheikhs  and  their  cohorts,  to  a  large  extent  words  have  not  been  followed  by  any  real  action.   Sheikh  al-Hilaly's  blatant  antise-  mitic  comments  as  long  ago  as  1988  should  already  then  have  sent  a  strong  warning  sign  to  the  Muslim  commu-  nity  to  purge  this  antisemite  from  their  midst.  The  mufti’s  ongoing  comments  and  recent  Holocaust  denial  should  similarly  have  reinforced  the  need  to  take  decisive  action  against  him.   These  latest  antisemitic  comments  by  Sheikh  Feiz  should  rally  the  Muslim  community  to  combat  this  intolerable,  vile  epidemic  among  its  members.

"  Adler’s  life  on  the  inside   JOSHUA  LEVI   RODNEY  Adler   experienced  both  good  and  bad  times  while  sharing  prison  cells  with  Hezbollah  sympa  thisers  dining  the  height  of  Israel’s   war  with  the  terrorist  organisation  in   2006.   Adler  admitted  in  an  interview  with  The  Bulletin  this  week  that  Mid  East  tensions  made  him  fearful  of   being  stabbed  when  he  was  moved  to   the  medium-security  Bathurst  Main  prison.  Stories  are  also  emerging  of  deep  friendships  he  established  with   some  of  the  inmates  of  Lebanese  Muslim  extraction.   A  source  close  to  Adler  has  told  The  AJN  that  many  Muslims  were  good  to  him.   Adler,  who  was  a  regular  in  the  gym  and  library,  was  “one  of  the  boys”  -  cooking,  eating  and  even  socialising  with  Muslim  inmates.   This  close  association  developed  as  a  result  of  what  Adler  told  The  Bul  letin  was  a  deliberate  decision  by  prison  authorities  to  place  him  with   Muslim  prisoners  who  had  Hezbollah  loyalties,  knowing  full  well  he  was  Jewish.   He  described  the  time  as  his  “most   fraught”  during  his  two-and-a-half  year  sentence  and  said  some  of  his  fel  low  inmates  “lost  loved  ones  during  the  bombings  in  Lebanon”.   “At  one  point,  I  heard  I  was  going  to  be  stabbed.  I  met  again  with  lead  ers  of  the  Muslim  community  in  [Bathurst  Main]  and  came  to  an  ‘understanding’  that  I  wouldn’t  be   touched.”   CONTINUED  ON  NEWS  4   Adler’s  life  on  the  inside   CONTINUED  FROM  NEWS  1   letter  from  Muslim  leaders  in  Bathurst's  low-security  prison.  “I  gave  this  letter  to  one  of  the  leaders  of  the  Lebanese  Muslim  community  in  Bathurst  Main  -  which  did  help  smooth  my  way  a  little.”   A  spokesperson  for  the  Department  of  Corrections  said  Adler  was  asked,  if  he  had  any  safety  concerns  when  he  was  moved  to  the  medium-security  prison.   ""As  a  duty  of  care  we  ask  each  pris  oner  if  they  fear  for  their  safety  because  they  can  be  moved  into  protective  cus  tody,  however,  he  said  he  had  no  con   cerns,”  the  spokesperson  said.   She  said  there  was  a  ""reasonable”  level  of  Muslim  prisoners  at  the  jail,  and  that  Adler  was  not  placed  in  a  cell  block  with  a  higher  than  usual  number  of  Muslim  inmates.   “At  a  later  date  he  was  put  in  protec  tion,  but  that  was  as  a  result  of  his  own  action.  It  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  fact  that  he  is  Jewish.""   Adler  was  sentenced  to  a  non-parole  period  of  two-and-a-half  years  in  April  2005,  and  was  released  on  parole  in   October. ",2007-12-07
"  Israeli  scholar  blasts   ‘submissive’  leadership   JASON  FRENKEL   AUSTRALIA  is  a  provincial  backwater  constrained  by  polit  ical  correctness,  where  Jewish  community  leaders  are  intimi  dated  by  Muslim  thugs.   That’s  the  dim  assessment  of   visiting  Islam  expert  Raphael  Israeli,  who  this  week  lashed  out  at  critics  of  his  explosive  appraisal  of  Muslim  immi  grants  and  his  call  for  a  preven  tative  policy  to  keep  the  Muslim  population  in  check   In  a  letter  posted  on  www.jihadwatch.org,  he  likened  Australian  Jewish  community  leaders  to  dhimmis,  the  second  class  citizens  forced  to  live  in  subservience  under  Muslim  rule.   “When  the  storm  erupted,  the  dhimmi-like  Jewish  leader  ship  cancelled  all  activities,  in  a  shameful  submission  to  the  Muslim  thugs  and  under  the  false  claims  of  a  ‘multicultural  society7  in  Australia,  which  they  know  is  not  true,”  the  letter  said   Professor  Israeli  told  the  AJN  the  remarks  were  made  in  a  pri   vate  letter  to  an  American  friend  and  were  posted  on  the  website  without  his  permission  -  but  he  did  not  withdraw  them.   In  the  letter,  he  defended  his  academic  credentials  and  said   there  was  widespread  support  for  his  grim  assessment  of  Mus  lim  immigrants  -  although  peo  ple  were  too  scared  to  publicly   back  him.   “The  other  issue  is  the  polit   ical  correctness  which  does  not   allow  those  things  to  be  said,  though  privately  everyone  sup  ports  what  I  said.   “In  any  case,  my  teaching  on   Islam  stands  and  it  even   increased  interest  in  my  lec  tures,  but  the  public  lecture  tour  was  cancelled  and  the  Jewish   Shalom  Institute  CEO  Hilton   Immerman...  Israeli  was  chosen  on  his  ""academic  credentials”.   leadership  shamefully  dis  owned  me  instead  of  standing  up  for  me.”   He  said  community  leaders  had  opted  to  shoot  the  messen  ger  in  the  wake  of  the  contro  versy  surrounding  his   comments.   “When  the  storm  erupted,  the  dhimmi-like   Jewish  leadership  cancelled  all  activities,  in  a  shameful  submission  to  the  Muslim  thugs   and  under  the  false  claims  of  a  multicultural  society  in  Australia.”   PROFESSOR  RAPHAEL  ISRAELI   “I  blamed  the  violence  of  Muslims  in  the  world  (and  by  implication  here)  for  the  trou  bles  they  are  having,  but  they  chose  to  accuse  the  messenger.  They  apologised  to  the  thugs  and  brought  upon  themselves  the  disgrace  of  unconditional   submission.   “They  do  not  want  to  rock  the  boat  They  are  scared  to  stir  things  up.  The  easiest  way  for   AUAC  executive  director  Dr  Colin  Rubensteln...  comments  were  ""unacceptable"".   them  was  to  sacrifice  the  guest  they  invited,  thus  punishing  not  me,  but  the  Jewish  audiences  who  need  the  education  for  which  I  was  brought  here.   “I  was  also  struck  by  the  provinciality  of  the  place,  where  a  minor  item  of  gossip   about  one  individual  who  said  something  becomes  a   national  issue.  I  am  not  the   minister  of  immigration.  Before  me,  the  prime  pinister  and  [Federal  Treasurer  Peter]  Costello  have  said  harsher  things  after  Muslim  riots,  but  someone  elected  to  seize   upon  this  opportunity  now  and  sweep  Australia  into  a  storm  in  a  tea  cup.” ",2007-02-23
"  Loewenstein’s   Islamophobia   claim  slammed   PETER  KOHN   INTER-FAITH  activists  and  Jewish  community  leaders  have  criticised  comments  by  Independent  Aus  tralian  Jewish  Voices  co-founder  Antony  Loewenstein  that  Australian  Jews  are  anti-Muslim.   Loewenstein,  author  of  My  Israel  Question,  which  claims  Jews  who  criticise  Israel  in  any  form  are  ostracised  by  the  mainstream  Aus  tralian  Jewish  community,  made  the  claim  of  Jewish  anti-Muslim  preju  dice  on  ABC  TV’s  Difference  Of  Opinion  on  April  2.   His  inclusion  as  the  Jewish  repre   sentative  on  a  show  that  screened  on  first-night  seder  raised  the  hack  les  of  Member  for  Melbourne  Ports  Michael  Danby.

The  sole  Jew  on  a  four-member  multi-faith  panel,  Loewenstein  said  that  “within,  say,  Judaism  and  within  Christianity,  I’m  talking  about  in  Australia,  say,  there’s  a  great  deal  of  anti-Muslim  feeling”.   Peta  Jones  Pellach,  the  director  of  adult  education  at  Sydney’s  Shalom  Institute,  is  involved  in  the  Aus  tralian  National  Dialogue  of  Chris  tians,  Muslims  and  Jews,  and  the  Women’s  Debate  Network.   She  told  the  AJN  Loewenstein’s   comment  is  “absolute  nonsense”.   She  said  the  Jewish  community  in  Australia  maintains  dialogue  “not  with  all,  but  with  many  sections  of  the  Muslim  community”.   Moreover,  Judaism  traditionally  respects  Islam  as  a  like-minded  monotheistic  faith,  she  said,  “to  which  we  are  closest  ideologically”.   “Of  course,  some  Jews  are  preju  diced,  but  certainly  not  the  organ  ised  Jewish  community  ...  he’s  just  wrong,”  Jones  Pellach  said.   “I  don't  remember  seeing   [Loewenstein]  at  any  of  the  many  inter-faith   events  that  have  been   held  that  involved  Jews,   Christians  and  Muslims.”   RABBI  JOHN  LEVI   Co-founder,  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews   Inter-faith  pioneer  Rabbi  John  Levi,  who  has  been  meeting  with   Australian  Muslim  leaders  for  the  past  45  years  and  co-founded  the  Council  of  Christians  and  Jews  more  than  20  years  ago,  said   Loewenstein’s  comments  came  from  someone  who  has  not  devel   oped  any  kind  of  profile  in  helping  to  develop  Jewish-Muslim  relations   in  Australia.

"  Indians  key  to  inter-faith   relations,  says  visiting  activist   TAUAKATZ   RABBI  David  Rosen,  a  leading  inter  faith  activist  from  the  American  Jew  ish  Committee  (AJC),  has  told  Australian  audiences  that  a  historic   mission  to  Israel  will  help  Jewish   Muslim  relations.   Rabbi  Rosen’s  visit  follows  an   unprecedented  six-day  Indian  Mus  lim  inter-faith  delegation  to  Israel,  organised  by  the  AJC  and  the  Aus  tralia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  (AIJAC).  The  eight  religious  leaders  who  participated  represent  200  mil  lion  Muslims  in  India,  one-quarter  of  the  world’s  Muslim  population.  The  group  met  with  President  Shimon  Peres  and  Foreign  Minister  Tzipi  Livni,  and  participated  in  inter-faith  dialogue  with  the  Chief  Rabbinate  of   Israel.   Rabbi  Rosen  told  audiences  the   tour  was  prompted  by  his  trip  to  India  earlier  this  year  with  Israeli  Ashkenazi  Chief  Rabbi  Yona  Metzger  and  a  delegation  of  chief  rabbis  from   around  the  world.   “We  have  developed  an  inter-reli  gious  dialogue  with  the  major  Hindu  leadership  in  India,  and  this  relation  ship  with  the  Indian  Muslim  leader  ship  is  no  less  important,”  he  said.

He  was  In  Australia  last  week  promoting  Jewlsh-Musllm  dialogue.   All  India  Organisation  of  Imams  of  Mosques,  personally  addressed  protests  against  the  trip,  which  delayed  his  arrival  in  Israel.   However,  his  support  for  the  pro  gram  was  unwavering.   “We  are  coming  with  a  message  of  peace  and  goodwill  from  Indian  Mus   lims  who  believe  in  the  Indian  tradi   tion  of  resolving  issues  through  dialogue  and  peaceful  means.   “Our  visit  to  Israel  will  be  histori  cal  in  terms  of  developing  a  dialogue   between  Judaism  and  Islam.  Interac  tion  with  both  Palestinian  and  Jewish  sisters  and  brothers  and  their  leader   ship  will  lay  a  solid  foundation  for  future  engagement,”  he  said.   A  joint  declaration  between  the  delegation  and  the  Chief  Rabbinate  of  Israel  stated  that  while  Judeo-Muslim  relations  have  deteriorated  as  a  result   of  political  factors,  “it  is  high  time  for  the  religious  leaders  of  both  sides  to  engage  in  dialogue  and  stop  the   bloodshed  of  innocent  civilians”.

"  FUNDAMENTALIST  DANGER   AS  a  non-Jewish  Australian,  I  have  real  fears  that  Australia  is  at  risk  from  Islam,  and  in  turn  Islamic  law  has  the  capacity  to  burden  the  Jewish  com  munity  of  Australia.This  is  not  an  Islamophobic  view  but  the  reality  of  the  world  today.   This  warning  does  not  indude  Muslims  who  simply  want  a  better  life,  one  of  prosperity  and  freedom  in  Australia.  And  the  majority  of  Mus  lims  who  come  here  are  law-abiding  people  who  want  t6  be  part  of  the  Australian  family.  The  Muslim  sharing  your  seat  next  to  you  as  you   ride  the  train  to  work  is  not  the  problem.   It  only  becomes  a  problem  if  such   fundamentalist  views  as  those  of   Sheikh  Hilaly  are  allowed  to  reign  and  risk  inciting  violence  between  Muslim  and  non-Muslim  Australians.   And  if  Australia  attempts  to  fight  this  fire,  I  see  Australians  getting  burnt  by  embers  that  can’t  be  put  out.   GARY  BURNS  Woollahra,  NSW ",2007-04-13
"  Gag  order  on  imams  a  ‘public-relations  stunt’   TONI  BASHAN   AN  order  to  gag  five  Islamic  clerics  won’t  stop  extremist  views  from  reach  ing  the  general  public,  according  to  the  Jewish  human-rights  watchdog.   Last  week  the  Lebanese  Muslim   Association  (LMA),  the  peak  body  associated  with  Muslim/Australian  relations,  ordered  five  of  the  nation’s  most  influential  sheikhs  from  speaking  to  the  media,  including  controversial  imam  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly.   But  B’nai  Brith’s  Anti-Defamation  Commission  (ADC)  this  week  issued  a  scathing  response  to  the  gag  order,  describing  the  move  as  a  “public-rela   tions  stunt”.   ADC  executive  officer  Manny  Waks  said;  “This  move  by  the  LMA  is  clearly   Sheikh  Tajeddln  al-HHaly...  defied  gag   order.   designed  to  address  the  negative  pub  licity  the  Muslim  community  has  been  receiving  of  late,  but  does  nothing  to  ensure  that  those  same  clerics  do  not  preach  extremist  ideology  from  their   mosques.   “The  clerics  will  still  continue  to  spread  their  messages  of  hate,  but  the  media  will  not  know  about  it,”  he  said.   Sheikh  Hilal/s  notoriety  dates  back  to  a  1988  address  to  students  at  the  University  of  Sydney  where  he  allegedly  made  antisemitic  comments.   More  recently  he  has  come  under  the  spotlight  for  comparing  women  wearing  revealing  clothes  to  “uncov  ered  meat”,  and  claiming  to  Egyptian   media  that  Australians  are  “liars”  and  have  less  of  a  right  to  live  in  this  coun  try  than  Muslims.   The  outspoken  Muslim  leader  already  flouted  the  ban  when  he  addressed  reporters  outside  his  Lakemba  mosque  last  Friday.   “I’m  friends  with  media.  Media  is  our  eyes,  our  heart,  our  blood,”  Sheikh  Hilaly  is  reported  to  have  said.   All  five  imams  are  from  Lakemba  Mosque,  the  spiritual  hub  of  Aus  tralia’s  Islamic  community.   The  list  also  includes  Sheikh  Shady  Suleiman  and  Sheikh  Yahya  Safe,  the  official  representative  of  the  Mufti  of   Lebanon. ",2007-03-16
"  Inter-faith  house  project  to  build  relationships   LEXI  LANDSMAN   AUSTRALASIAN  Union  of  Jewish  Students  (AUJS)  has  developed  an   inter-faith  initiative  to  unite  students  in  a  long-term  project  that  would  not  only  help  the  underprivileged,  but  strengthen  Muslim-Jewish  relations.   The  project,  which  has  been  in  planning  for  four  months,  will  involve  50  Jewish  and  Muslim  stu  dents  working  on  building  a  house  for  a  poor  family.   The  group  will  work  in  partner  ship  with  a  global  charity  called  Habi  tat  for  Humanity  International  (HFHI),  which  the  AJN  understands  will  provide  land  for  the  housing.   Slava  Inberg,  AUJS  regional  inter   faith  officer,  told  the  AJN  that  the  project  “aims  to  bring  Muslim  and  Jewish  students  together  to  create  lasting  relationships”   “We’re  creating  lifelong  friend  ships  and  we  hope  they  will  continue  building  those  bonds.  There’s  a  lot  of  links  to  be  repaired  and  a  lot  of  obsta  cles  to  be  overcome  and  this  project  is  one  of  the  ways  to  mend  them,”  he   said.   The  students  will  help  with  the  planning  and  will  even  have  hands-on  involvement  in  the  actual  construction  of  the  house.   “This  project  is  an  initiative  for  bridging  the  gap  between  Jewish  and  Muslim  students,”  AUJS  NSW  presi  dent  Isabel  Nemirovsky  told  the  AJN.   “It’s  a  step  towards  eradicating  pre   conceived  notions  that  we  aren’t  able  to  get  along,  and  to  develop  a  sense  of  unity  from  working  together  on  a  project.”   HFHI,  which  was  founded  in  1976,  is  a  non-profit  housing  organi  sation  that  seeks  to  eliminate  poverty  housing  and  homelessness  from  the   world.

While  the  Palestinian  Christian   population  has  been  plummeting,  Israel’s  Christian  Arab  population  has  risen  handsomely.  Why?  Because   Christian  and  Muslim  Israelis  have   the  same  civil  rights  as  Jewish   Israelis.  This  includes  freedom  of  speech  and  religion,  freedom  to  vote  and  to  protest.

"  GIVING  IN  TO  BLACKMAIL   IT  is  extremely  unfortunate  that  Jerusalem’s  mayor  has  succumbed  to  threats  of  violence  and  discontinued   archaeological  digs  near  the  Temple   Mount.   First,  giving  in  to  blackmail  is,  of  course,  a  counter-productive  policy.  More  importantly,  the  work  being  undertaken  in  Jerusalem  is  expected  to  reaffirm  that  Jewish  holy  sites  -  and  hence  settlement  of  the  Holy  Land  -  preceded  Muslim  occupation  by  many  centuries.  This  has  huge  implications  for  the  political  debate  about  owner  ship  of  the  land.  Hence,  it  is  no  sur  prise  that  the  Muslim  world  is  resisting  the  digs  tooth  and  nail.

"  Temple  Mount  work  on  hold   NE1ASELA   TEL  AVIV  —  Jerusalem  Mayor  Uri  Lupolianski  suspended  construction  of  a  pavement  at  the  Mugrabi  Gate  late  Sunday  night  in  a  bid  to  douse  Muslim  anger  at  renovation  work  near  the  Temple  Mount.   Muslim  leaders  fear  the  deploy  ment  of  heavy  machinery  near  the  Temple  Mount  could  damage  the  foundations  of  the  al-Aqsa  Mosque,  with  some  saying  the  renovation  work  is  an  act  of  provocation  by  Israel.  Israel  has  rejected  these  claims.   Following  consultations  with  Attorney-General  Menachem  Mazuz  and  Muslim  and  Jewish  leaders,  Lupolianski  decided  to  postpone  the  renovation  work  until  zoning  authorities  complete  drafting  plans  for  the  Mugrabi  Gate  area.   Jerusalem  residents  -  Arabs  and  Jews  alike  -  will  be  given  sufficient  time  to  review  the  zoning  plans  and  to  submit  letters  of  opposition-to  the   renovations.   At  the  centre  of  the  dispute  are  plans  to  reconstruct  an  existing  bridge  that  leads  pedestrians  to  the  Mugrabi  Gate  in  the  Old  City.   The  Israel  Antiquities  Authority  will  be  allowed  to  proceed  with  archaeological  excavations  in  the  area,  while  public  hearings  on  the  matter  are  being  delivered  at  City   Hall.   The  decision  to  commission  a  zoning  plan  contravenes  a  decision   Protesters  demonstrate  against  the  building  of  a  new  bridge  at  the  Mograbi  Gate   In  the  Old  City.  Photo:  Isranet   by  the  Jerusalem  Municipality  Legal   Counsel  which  ruled  that  the  replacement  of  the  bridge  requires  a  routine  construction  permit.  Zoning  plans  are  reserved  to  the  construction  of  new  structures.   Lupoliansky  said  he  hoped  for  an  “ease  in  tensions  in  Jerusalem.  I  believe  that  cooperation  in  Jerusalem  can  bring  about  coexistence,  without  mutual  disregard.”   The  works  could  be  suspended  for   months.   Police  squashed  attempts  by  Mus  lim  youths  to  ignite  mass  riots  in  protest  at  the  works  soon  after  Friday  prayers  broke  off  Stones  and  Molo  tov  cocktails  were  hurled  at  police  men  who  fired  stun  grenades  to  disperse  the  rioters.   Meanwhile,  one  of  the  heads  of  Israel’s  Islamic  Movement  has  been   indicted  on  public  disorder  charges  and  attacking  police  during  riots  last  Wednesday  over  the  renovation   works.   An  indictment  has  been  filed  at   the  Jerusalem  Magistrate’s  Court  against  five  Arab  Israelis,  including  the  leader  of  the  Islamic  Movement,  Sheikh  Raed  Salah.   According  to  the  indictment,  the  five  held  an  illegal  gathering  during  which  they  attempted  to  force  their  way  onto  the  construction  site,  and  scuffled  with  and  cursed  at  a   policeman.

For  Australia’s  110,000  Jews,  the   man  with  the  mirror  has  been  a  visit   ing  academic  with  a  strong  voice  and,  arguably,  a  tin  ear  for  the  sensitivities  of  Jews  and  Muslims.   When  Professor  Raphael  Israeli,  a  visiting  scholar  of  Islam  from  the  Hebrew  University  of  Jerusalem,  spoke  about  Muslims  as  a  numerical  menace  in  western  society,  he  placed  the  Jewish  community,  front  and  cen  tre,  into  the  heated  values  debate  now  raging  in  Australia.   Professor  Israeli  portrayed  what  he  sees  as  the  dire  consequences  of  an  Islamic  community  in  France  that  accounts  for  around  nine  per  cent  of  the  population,  and  pointed  omi  nously  at  “demographic  pressure”  from  Indonesia,  Australia’s  northern  neighbour  and  the  world’s  most  pop   ulous  Islamic  nation.  His  views  touched  a  raw  nerve  in  the  Jewish  community  and  beyond.   The  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  withdrew  its  impri   matur  from  Professor  Israeli’s  visit   and  cancelled  speaking  engagements.  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  labelled  his  comments  “racist”.  But  Sydney’s  Shalom  Insti  tute,  which  brought  the  academic  to  Australia,  has  defended  his  right  to  speak,  a  view  echoed  by  the  State   Zionist  Council  of  Victoria  and  the  Australian  Friends  of  the  Hebrew   University.  The  bulk  of  letters  pub  lished  in  the  AJN  in  the  past  two  weeks  tend  to  lend  more  support  than   criticism  for  Professor  Israeli’s  view  on   limiting  Muslim  populations  in  west  ern  countries,  including  Australia.   FOR  Dr  Suzanne  Rutland,  the  Jew   ish  community’s  divided  reactions   to  Professor  Israeli’s  comments   reveal  strong  internal  dilemmas.   Dr  Rutland,  who  is  associate  pro  fessor  of  the  Department  of  Hebrew,  Biblical  and  Jewish  Studies  at  the  Uni  versity  of  Sydney,  portrays  a  moral  dilemma  within  one  of  the  world’s  most  intensely-woven  survivor  com   munities,  informed  by  the  legacy  of   the  Shoah.   She  said  that  when  members  of  radical  Islamic  group  Hizb  ut-Tahrir  spoke  at  a  conference  in  Sydney  in  January,  calling  for  Australia  to  be  included  in  an  Islamic  caliphate  under  shari’a  law,  “the  Jewish  com  munity,  as  survivors,  has  a  right  to  be   concerned”   “It’s  very  chilling,  it’s  very  worry  ing  ...  As  a  Holocaust-survivor  com  munity,  we  sometimes  act  with  [relatively]  greater  paranoia,”  Dr  Rut   land  said.   “Radical  Islam  is  a  threat  not  just  to  Jews,  but  to  the  whole  western,  lib  eral  world.  From  my  research  on  Jew  ish  feelings,  on  teachings  of  radical  imams  in  Sydney  and  Melbourne,  from  material  found  in  the  book  shops  of  mosques,  from  what  school  children  in  our  government  schools  are  saying,  these  are  very  real  issues.”   But  then  she  talks  about  the  other  side  of  the  dilemma.   “As  Jews,  we  cannot  say  we  should  stop  Muslim  migration  to  Australia.  [Many]  were  refugees  as  we  were...  to  come  out  publicly  and  say  there  should  be  a  halt  to  migration  for  me  as  a  Jew  goes  against  the  grain.  We  were  also  refugees.”   However,  Dr  Rutland  sees  practi  cal  measures  the  government  can   take.   “The  government  needs  to  moni  tor  what’s  going  on.  Where  there  are  radical  imams  here,  they  should  not  be  allowed  to  speak  out.   “The  government  should  return  funds  to  education  so  that  main  stream  Australians  can  be  taught  not  to  harbour  anti-Muslim  feeling  and,  at  the  same  time,  should  educate  Muslim  groups  against  anti-Jewish  and  anti-western  feeling.”   Furthermore,  groups  such  as  Hizb  ut-Tahrir,  that  preach  hatred,  should  be  outlawed,  she  said.   FOR  Monash  University  social   work  lecturer  Dr  Phillip  Mendes,  who  co-edited  Jews  and  Australian  Politics,  it  is  not  so  much  the  Holo  caust,  as  six  decades  of  Israeli  history  that  creates  deep  unease  among  Aus   tralian  Jews  with  the  growth  of   Islamic  communities  in  Australia.   “For  many  Australian  Jews,  Mus  lims  don’t  remind  them  of  Hitler,  but  of  Hamas  and  Hezbollah,”  he  told  the  AJN.   “Jews  tend  to  see  Muslims  as  ter  rorists  because  they  look  to  the  Mid  dle  East  and  see  Muslims  blowing  up  Jews,  and  to  what  happened  in  Bali  and  so  on.  But  we  have  to  be  careful   not  to  fell  into  the  antisemite’s  trap,  to  do  what  they  used  to  do  when  they  said,  ‘all  Jews  are  Bolsheviks’,  by  saying   all  Muslims  are  terrorists.”   He  raised  the  spectre  of  Australian  Muslims  as  “the  new  Jews”,  an  issue  canvassed  in  a  debate  during  last   year’s  Limmud  Oz  Jewish  learning  festival,  after  the  Islamic  community  was  portrayed  in  the  media  as  the  lat  est  new  wave  of  arrivals  to  face  the  wrath  of  xenophobia.   However,  Dr  Mendes  said  the  infighting  in  the  Jewish  community   over  Professor  Israeli’s  comments  has  earned  praise  from  one  Muslim  expert.   He  cited  prominent  Sydney  Mus   lim  commentator  Irfan  Yusuf.  Writ   ing  for  the  left-wing  New  Matilda  website,  Yusuf  remarked  how  free  and  open  the  debate  is  within  the  Jewish  community.   Yusuf  also  wondered  out  loud  how  much  argument  there  would  have  been  among  Australian  Mus  lims  if  a  visiting  Islamic  academic  had  suggested  a  capping  of  Jewish  immigration.   J|  SSOCIATE  Professor  Douglas  ff|  Kirsner,  who  chairs  the  public  Ini.  affairs  committee  of  the  B’nai  B’rifh  Anti-Defamation  Commission,  said  Jews  generally  have  a  strong  sense   of  compassion  for  minorities,  but  that  should  not  stop  them  from  speaking  out  about  “core  values”   “The  Jewish  community  should  be  very  forward  in  speaking  about  the  important  core  values  of  democracy,  freedom,  gender  equality  and  non  violence,”  he  said.   He  charged  that  the  Jewish  com  munity  “has  generally  bent  over  back  wards  to  be  politically  correct”  and   has  been  “too  sensitive”.   “I  think  we  need  to  speak  our  minds,  but  within  that,  we  need  to  be  careful  about  not  labelling  entire  groups.”   But  Associate  Professor  Kirsner   said  the  fight  to  keep  out  Muslim   extremists  has  very  little  to  do  with  numbers  of  Muslims  in  Australia  or  with  limiting  those  numbers.   He  compared  Muslim  tensions  in  Europe  and  growing  numbers  of  rad  ical  pronouncements  by  Australian  Muslims  with  what  he  sees  as  a  very  different  picture  in  the  United  States,  where  he  believes  Muslims  have  inte  grated  well  and  share  mainstream  values  to  a  greater  degree.   OR  Temple  Beth  Israel  Emeritus  Rabbi  John  Levi,  a  pioneer  of  inter-faith  work  in  Australia,  there  are  fundamental  issues  involved  in   the  Australian  Jewish  community’s   attitudes  to  Muslims.   First  and  foremost,  is  the  intona  tion  of  Shemot  (Exodus)  and  the  Divine  prohibition  against  oppress  ing  the  stranger,  “for  you  were  strangers  in  Egypt”,  which  he  believes  strikes  a  deep  chord  in  the  Australian  Jewish  community.   He  also  warns  against  the  tempta  tion  to  generalise  about  Australia’s  Muslim  communities,  which  are   diverse  and  come  from  very  different   Muslim  societies  with  different  tradi  tions  of  Islam.   “Many  Muslims  are  here  because  they  chose  not  live  under  shari’a  law,  but  to  escape  it.”   Rabbi  Levi  does  not  believe  Aus  tralian  Jews  see  Muslim  fundamental  ists  as  “fascists”,  despite  the  common  usage  of  the  term  “Islamo-fascists”.   “Jews  recognise  the  clash  as  a  clash  with  an  imperial  religion  ...  it  would  be  a  mistake  to  classify  movements  in  the  Middle  East  in  terms  of  European   nationalism  ...  it’s  not  Italian  fascism  or  German  racism.”   But  he  believes  that  since  the  upsurge  in  worldwide  terror,  “fewer  Jews  have  sympathy”  with  Muslim  newcomers  and  the  persecution  they  suffer,  even  if  these  are  the  same  trials  and  tribulations  that  Jewish  newcom  ers  had  to  endure  after  the  war.   Rabbi  Levi  said  he  is  vehemently  opposed  to  quotas  on  immigration  based  on  religion,  as  these  smack  of  the  quotas  imposed  on  Jews  by  Aus  tralia  in  the  immediate  postwar  years.  The  government  of  the  day  claimed  to  be  preserving  a  cohesive  society  in  the  face  of  its  mass-migration  pro  gram  and,  in  the  wake  of  the  Shoah,  saw  the  admission  of  large  numbers  of  Jews  as  problematic.   “But  the  government  is  unwise  to  encourage  immigration  from  countries  that  have  a  bad  track   record  on  terror  and  not  just  Mus   lim  countries.”   In  many  ways,  Jews  think  along  the  lines  of  other  Australians,  he  said.   “We  were  very  grateful  for  the  pol  icy  of  multiculturalism,  because  at  last  it  gave  the  Jewish  community  a  public  profile  and  acknowledged  that  we  didn’t  all  sing  from  the  same  hymn  book.”   Rabbi  Levi  is  researching  the  val  ues  debate  in  Australia  for  a  chapter  he  is  writing  in  a  forthcoming  book.  Although  committed  to  multicul  turalism,  he  said  he  has  been  won  dering  for  some  years  about  whether  shared  Australian  values  have  been  neglected.   “Nobody  has  ever  said  what  it  is  that  makes  us  Australian.” ",2007-03-02

PROFESSOR  Raphael  Israeli,  who  dearly  accepts  that  there  are  both  mod  erate  and  extremist  Muslims,  has  allegedly  argued  for  more  stringent   policies  to  protect  national  security,  including  greater  policing  of  terror,  the  capping  of  numbers  of  Muslim  immi  grants  to  Australia,  and  a  return  to  a  more  homogenous  culture  in  order  to  protect  Australia’s  democratic  way  of  life  (AJN16/2).   The  Australian  Jewish  community  supports  freedom  of  speech;  Professor  Israeli  is  a  distinguished  scholar  who  is  entitled  to  his  views.  We  also  recognise  that  extremist  Islam,  with  its  record  of,  and  potential  for,  terror  is  a  real  threat.  Thus  our  community  accepts  the  need  for  stringent  examination  of  potential  immigrants,  Muslim  and  non-Muslim  alike,  at  any  time  and  particularly  now.  However  Australia’s  Jewish  community  continues  to  oppose  any  discriminatory  immigration  policy  that  rejects  or  limits  potential  Australian  citizens  based  only  on  the  applicant’s  religion  or  race.   The  issues  raised  by  Professor  Israeli  are  increasingly  being  debated  in   western  nations  -  issues  on  which  hard   decisions  may  eventually  have  to  be  made.  However  they  have  huge  ramifi   cations  for  the  democratic  nature  of   our  societies.  Seeking  meaningful  col  laboration  with  truly  moderate  Mus  lims  is  our  preferred  response  to  the   current  concerns  about  Islamic  terror.

"  JEWISH  LEADERS:  HILALY  SHOULD  GO  —  BUT  NO  COMPARISON  TO  HILTER     JASON  FRENKEL     JEWISH  community  leaders  have  criticised  comparisons  between  con-  troversial  Islamic  cleric  Sheikh  Tajed-  din  al-Hilaly  and  Adolf  Hitler,  while  urging  Australia’s  Muslim  community  to  replace  him  as  its  leading  spokesman.   Sheikh  Hilaly,  the  nation’s  most  senior  Muslim  cleric,  labelled  white  Australians  “liars”  last  week  during  an  attack  on  his  adopted  home  on  Egyptian  television.   His  comments  prompted  the  legal   adviser  to  the  Australian  Federation  of  Islamic  Councils,  Haset  Sali,  to  liken  the  outspoken  mufti  to  the  Nazi   leader.   “He  has  been  about  as  helpful  to   Islam  in  Australia  as  Adolf  Hitler  was   to  Christianity  during  the  Second  World  War,”  Mr  Sali  said.   Executive  Council  of  Australian   Jewry  president  Grahame  Leonard  said  the  comparison  was  “not  help-  ful”,  and  described  the  mufti  as  an  embarrassment  who  was  suffering  foot-in-mouth  disease.   Leonard  said  the  Muslim  commu-   nity  needed  to  reassess  Hilaly’s  role  as  its  key  representative  at  the  Aus-  tralian  National  Imams  Council  con-   Sheik  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly...  “an  embarrassment.""     ference,  which  has  now  been  delayed  until  April.   The  conference,  at  which  Hilaly's  future  will  be  discussed,  was  to  have  been  held  later  this  month.   “I  don’t  think  anyone  now  takes  him  seriously,  but  they  do  see  him  as  an  embarrassment,  and  not  just  for  Muslims,  but  for  Australia  generally,”   Leonard  said.   “And  while  he  has  all  the  rights  of  an  Australian  citizen,  surely  the  lead-  ers  of  Australia’s  Islamic  community  should  be  thinking  hard  about  how  they  limit  the  damage  and  harm  he  is  causing  to  their  image.”   Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  national  chairman  Mark   Leibler  said  Hilaly’s  controversial   comments  were  not  the  result  of   poor  language  skills.   “I  don’t  think  he  suffers  from  foot-in-mouth  disease,  I  think  he  should  be  taken  at  face  value,  I  think  he  means  what  he  says,  and  I  don’t  think  he’s  a  fool,”  Leibler  said.   “He’s  really  not  a  problem  or  us,  he’s  not  a  problem  for  the  Jewish  community  -  he’s  a  real  problem  for  the  Muslim  community  because  the  sentiments  he  conveys  publicly  do  not  represent  the  views  of  the  vast  majority  of  Muslims.”   Hilaly  has  come  under  fire  from  Jewish  leaders  in  the  past  for  allegedly  praising  suicide  bombers  and  calling  for  a  jihad  on  Israel.

"  ANTI-MULTICULTURAL  HOWARD   MARK  Bakers  piece  {AJN  26/1)  is  indeed  timely  considering  how  John  Howard  has  done  away  with  “multi  culturalism”  from  the  Department  of  Immigration  and  replaced  it  with  “cit  izenship”.  And,  if  you  hadn’t  noticed,   Howard  was  anti-multiculturalism  well  before  Muslim  extremists  reared  their  ugly  heads.  Howard  was  anti  Asian  immigration  back  in  the  1980s,  and  finally  has  achieved  his  goal,  with  many  members  of  our  community  going  along  for  the  ride,  mainly  because  of  their  fear  of  Muslim  extremists.   But  if  those  members  of  our  com   munity  think  they  will  be  safer,  they  are  barking  up  the  wrong  tree.  There  are  some  300,000  Muslims  living  here  and  they  are  here  to  stay,  just  as  we  are  here  to  stay  -  so  we  better  get  along   with  each  other.  Sure  there  are  extremist  elements  in  the  Muslim   community,but  their  cause  is  only  fur  thered  by  antagonising  the  moderates.   Multiculturalism  is  a  way  of  respecting  differences  and  finding  common  ground.  Howard’s  integra  tion  plan  will  only  alienate  those  who  don’t  think  they  can  or  want  to  fit  into  his  mould  of  Australian  values  and   culture  and  it’s  those  people  who  we  need  the  most  to  be  made  to  feel  at  home.   I,  for  one,  was  a  much  prouder  Aus   tralian  before  Howard  and  Pauline   Hanson  began  their  attacks  on  polit   ical  correctness  and  multiculturalism.   mm  HERZOG   Elwood,  Vic ",2007-02-02
"  Multicultural  maze   FOR  the  past  three  decades,  Australian  Jews  have  largely  supported  —   and  greatly  benefited  from  -  the  Australian  version  of  multicultur  alism.  The  emergence  of  a  strong,  vibrant  and  flourishing  Jewish  community,  fully  integrated  into  the  Australian  way  of  life  while  maintaining  its  own  culture  and  tradition,  was  no  doubt  encouraged,  at  the  very  least,  by  the  formal  adoption  of  multiculturalism  by  Malcolm  Fraser’s  government  in  1978.   But  multiculturalism  is  now  under  attack  -  not  dead  yet  perhaps,  but  def  initely  on  the  defensive.  Prime  Minister  John  Howard’s  decision  last  week  to  replace  “multiculturalism”  with  “citizenship”  in  the  title  of  the  office  of  the  minister  for  immigration  was  a  symbolic  and  telling  sign  of  the  turning  tide.   The  changing  attitudes  -  one  of  the  manifestations  of  the  post-9/11  world  and  the  emergence  of  fundamentalist  Islam  -  are  clearly  evident  in  other   countries  as  well.   In  Great  Britain  this  week,  multiculturalism  was  listed  as  the  main  culprit  for  the  shocking  results  of  a  survey  which  found  that  40  per  cent  of  young  Muslims  -  mostly  bom,  bred  and  educated  in  “multicultural”  Britain  -  would  prefer  to  live  under  shari’a  law.   Australians,  including  many  Jews,  are  reacting  with  much  the  same  shock  as  they  confront  ongoing  manifestations  of  Muslim  fundamentalism,  as  espoused  in  the  recent  touting  of  the  Muslim  “superstate”  at  the  Hizb  ut  Tahrir  conference  held  last  week  in  Sydney  and  the  incessant  inflammatory  rhetoric  emanating  from  such  “spiritual  leaders”  as  Liverpool’s  Sheikh  Feiz  Mohammad  and  Lakemba’s  Sheikh  Tajeddin  al-Hilaly.   This  is  the  same  Sheikh  Hilaly  whose  harsh  invective  is  now  undermining  hitherto  successful  inter-faith  dialogue,  as  evidenced  by  this  week’s  entirely  justified  Jewish  and  Hindu  boycott  of  an  inter-faith  forum  which  the  unre  pentant  mufti  was  to  address.   Jews  who  rightly  extol  religious  freedom  for  all  have  no  choice  but  to  reassess  their  attitude  when  faced  with  extremist  fatwas  and  religious  edicts  that  regularly  challenge  democracy  and  other  “core  Australian  values”.  And  champions  of  the  glory  of  Australian  Jewish  schools  have  no  choice  but  to  have  a  hard  look  at  some  Muslim  madrassas  that  exploit  their  independence  to  preach  jihad,  martyrdom  and  rejection  of  non-Muslim  “heathens”.   At  the  same  time,  Jews  must  take  care  not  to  give  succour  to  avowed  ene  mies  of  multiculturalism,  such  as  Pauline  Hanson  and  many  of  last  year’s  Cronulla  rioters  who  hanker  for  the  dark  days  of  “White  Australia”.   It  is  a  tortuous  maze  to  navigate,  and  we  Jews  should  beware  of  “throwing  the  baby  out  with  the  bath  water”,  endangering  the  myriad  gains  that  multi  culturalism  has  brought  to  both  Australia  and  its  Jews.

"  Rabbi:  challenges  ahead  for  peoples  of  the  book   MV  STAFF   WHILE  there  is  much  to  celebrate  about  relations  between  the  Abra  hamic  faiths  in  Australia,  there  are  great  challenges  ahead,  a  Chabad  rabbi  said  in  Sydney  this  week.   “The  joy  we  can  feel  about  our  achievements  must  be  tempered   with  awe  at  the  vastness  of  the  task  in  front  of  us,”  Rabbi  Zalman  Kas  tel,  national  director  of  the  Together  for  Humanity  Founda   tion  inter-faith  group,  told  Sun  days  sixth  annual  Abraham  Con  ference  at  the  University  of  Sydney.   “There  are  many  who  are  aligned  to  our  faiths  who  are  cer  tainly  not  growing  together  yet.  Many,  in  fact,  are  growing  apart  in  fear,  anger,  in  hate,  and  contempt,”  said  Rabbi  Kastel,  who  is  also  the  youth  rabbi  of  Chabad  of  the   North  Shore.   “Many  who  have  begun  the  journey,  myself  included,  have  a   Emanuel  School  students  Sam   Ozana  and  Emily  Nathan  with   Muslim  student   Hatlce  Derell  from  Sule  College  at  the  Youth  Encounters  function.   Photo:  Ingrid  Shakenovsky   have  a  long  way  to  go.”   Other  speakers  at  the  confer  ence,  which  was  organised  by  the  Affinity  Intercultural  Organisa  tion,  included  Reverend  Dr  David  Gill,  former  secretary  of  the  National  Council  of  Churches  of  Australia,  and  Professor  Burhanet  tin  Tatar,  of  Turkey’s  Ondokuz  Mayir  University.   Rabbi  Kastel  spoke  of  two  major  tasks  in  bringing  faiths  together:  each  faith  community   needs  to  “divert  the  resources  from  other  priorities  to  create  and  sus  tain  effective,  creative  and  mean  ingful  responses”.   Offering  his  own  experience  as  an  example,  Rabbi  Kastel  said  his  involvement  with  inter-faith  work  transformed  him  “from  my  rela  tively  insular  upbringing  in  New  York  where  all  the  people  I  knew,  liked  and  respected  were  Jewish”.   “I  would  never  have  imagined  spending  a  week  in  Darwin,  work  ing  and  eating  breakfast  and  din  ner  together  with  a  Muslim  religious  leader  who  happened  to  be  an  Arab,  along  with  two  women,  one  Christian  and  the  other  Aboriginal.”   He  said  growing  together  requires  “courage  to  reflect  on  our  selves,  our  own  communities  and  even  in  our  sacred  texts.   “I  am  not  familiar  with  all  the  texts  but,  based  on  what  little  I  know,  I  think  I  say  confidently  that  there  are  passages  in  many  tradi  tions  that,  taken  at  face  value,  are  not  consistent  with  absolute   mutual  acceptance,  respect  for   each  other  and  each  other’s  beliefs   and  complete  empathy.”   The  conference’s  organisers  include  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  the  Muslim-based  Affin  ity  Intercultural  Foundation,  the   Columbian  Centre  for  Christian   Muslim  Relations,  the  Uniting  Church  and  the  Sydney  Catholic   Archdiocese.

"  from  ajn.com.au   The  following  are  some  of  the  best  comments  posted  on  ajn.com.au  over  the  last  week.   ON  JEWISH  ‘DISSIDENTS’   THERE  have  always  been  enough  crit  ics  of  Israel  abroad  without  the  need  for  Jews  to  add  their  voices.   DAVID  DUKES   SELF-HATING  Jew,  traitor,  etc.  are  the  terms  thrown  at  Jews  critical  of  Israeli  government  policies,  by  other  Jews.  (I've  been  on  the  receiving  end  -  even  from  those  I  attended  Sunday  school  with).  Politics  has  overshadowed  reli  gion  -  why  do  so  many  Jews  feel  they  have  to  direct  so  much  hatred  toward  fellow  Jews?  TROPPOCHOOK   IT  is  reassuring  that  some  semblance  of  upholding  pluralism  appears  where  Jews  opposed  to  the  official  policies  of  the  State  of  Israel  are  “not  being  silenced”.  It  falls  flat  however  when  they  are  instead  labelled  with  pejora  tive  terms  like  “Jews  for  genocide”.   NICHOLAS   AS  far  as  I  know,  plenty  of  Israelis  crit  icise  their  own  government's  policies,  and  that  is  seen  as  the  democratic  process.  Perhaps  they  are  closet  anti  semites  too.  KATHERINE   ON  PROFESSOR  ISRAELI   LEBANON  was  a  Christian  country,  “the  Switzerland  of  the  Middle  East”.  As  the  Muslim  population  increased  and  became  assertive,  Christians  left  in  droves.  Christian  emigration  and  Muslim  growth  led  to  a  Muslim  Major  ity  and  a  tribal,  violent  shambles  of  a  country  just  like  the  rest  of  the  Arab  world.

"  AIJAC  EXPLAINS   THE  decision  by  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  (AIJAC)  to  dissociate  from  Professor  Raphael  Israeli  has  been  inaccurately  por  trayed  by  some  as  AIJAC  cowering  before  the  Islamic  community,  or  kowtowing  to  the  politically  correct.  In  fact,  the  decision,  which  we  stand  by,  was  a  simple  matter  of  principle.   AIJAC  is  committed  to  a  non-dis  criminatory  immigration  policy,  and  is  strongly  opposed  to  quotas,  targets,  or  restrictions  on  immigration  based  on  either  religion  or  ethnicity,  including  any  such  policies  directed  against  Muslims.   We  are  pleased  that  Professor  Israeli  has  now  repudiated  earlier  reports  that  he  was  calling  for  limits  on  Muslim  immigration  into  Aus   tralia.   However,  we  remain  very  con  cerned  by  Professor  Israeli’s  implica  tion  that  Muslim  minority   communities  as  a  whole  are  a  threat   or  danger,  and  we  strongly  reject  any   such  claim.  Islamist  extremism  is  a   genuine  and  serious  global  problem,  but  it  is  completely  wrong  to  single  out  all  Muslims  for  suspicion  or  neg  atively  stereotype  the  Muslim  com  munity  as  a  whole  in  this  way.   AIJAC  also  disagrees  with  his  implication  in  the  AJN  that  multicul  turalism  is  a  contributing  factor  to  Islamist  extremism  in  Australia  and  his  subsequent  delegitimisation  of  Australia’s  successful  multicultural   policy.  We  believe  that  a  properly   implemented  policy  of  Australian  multiculturalism,  which  incorporates  both  rights  and  the  responsibility  to  uphold  the  core  values  of  Australian  society,  remains  an  important  part  of  the  strategy  to  counter  problems  related  to  political  extremism,  and  is   not  their  cause.   This  is  why  we  told  Professor  Israeli  that  his  comments  were  both   unacceptable  and  unhelpful,  that  AIJAC  cannot  be  associated  with  them  and  therefore  would  not  be  co   hosting  any  of  his  further  appear   ances  in  Australia.

"  Dr  Mordechal  Kedar...  Sydney  Muslims  “have  brought  Lebanon  to  Australia”.   Australia  ‘sleeping’   in  face  of  Iranian   threat  -  expert   CHEMISHALEV   IRAN’S  nuclear  ambitions  pose  a  grave  threat  to  Australian  national  security,  but  Canberra  is  “sleeping”  instead  of  dealing  with  the  men  ace,  according  to  a  visiting  Israeli   academic.   Dr  Mordechai  Kiedar,  a  lecturer  at  Bar-Ilan  University  and  a  researcher  at  the  university’s  Begin-Sadat  Cen  tre  for  Strategic  Studies,  told  the  AJN  this  week  that  Iran  aims  to  combine  its  nuclear  capabilities  with  sub   marines  and  missiles.   “Australia  isn’t  any  more  distant  than  the  rest  of  the  world  from  the  Iranian  menace.  One  submarine  in  the  Indian  Ocean,  another  in  the  Atlantic  and  a  third  in  the  Pacific,  at  a  distance  that  will  allow  them  to  hit  Tokyo,  Sydney,  New  York  or  London  -  and  Iran  will  rule  the  world,”  Dr  Kedar  said.   Dr  Kedar,  who  is  in  Australia  on  a  lecture  tour  on  behalf  of  the  Australia  Israel  Cultural  Exchange,  said  that  it  is  time  “to  ring  the  alarm  bells”  so  that  the  world  stops  “sleepwalking”  on  Iran.   The  current  attitude  of  the  interna   tional  community  and  the  limited  sanctions  imposed  on  Tehran  are  lead  ing  nowhere,  and  the  only  viable  approach  is  a  real  and  concerted  threat  by  the  world  on  the  Iranian  leadership  to  either  give  up  its  nuclear  program  immediately  or  be  deposed  by  force,   he  said.   “Only  when  they  are  at  the  edge  of  the  precipice,  only  when  they  feel  the  guillotine  brushing  their  necks  -  only  then  will  they  respond.”   Iran’s  regime  and  nuclear  facilities  can  be  destroyed  from  the  air,  Dr  Kedar  claimed,  without  the  need  for  a  land  invasion.   “With  aerial  attacks,  you  can  bring  them  to  their  knees.”   Iran’s  primary  target,  he  asserted,  is  not  Israel,  but  rather  the  Persian  Gulf,  which  Tehran  aims  to  control  with  the  help  of  Shi’ite  communi  ties  in  Bahrain,  Kuwait,  Saudi  Ara  bia  and  Iraq.  But  the  western  campaign  should  not  be  aimed  against  the  Iranian  people,  who  Dr  Kedar  described  as  essentially  secu   lar  and  liberal.   Dr  Kedar  warned,  though,  against  the  designs  of  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin,  who  is  putting  together  an  anti-western  bloc  of  rogue  states  and  regimes,  and  is  using   Iran  as  a  bellwether  to  test  the  West’s  alertness  and  resolve.   Dr  Kedar  also  ventured  into  the  controversy  created  during  the  visit  to  Australia  by  his  academic  col  league,  Professor  Raphael  Israeli,  describing  as  “ridiculous”  Professor  Israeli’s  claim  that  when  a  Muslim  minority  reaches  10  per  cent  it  becomes  dangerous.   “  [Professor]  Israeli  himself  lives  in  a  country  in  which  the  Muslim  pop  ulation  is  20  per  cent  -  and  it  is  not  they  who  endanger  the  country,”  Dr   Kedar  said.   Drawing  on  his  observations  on  Muslim  life  in  Australia,  Dr  Kedar  said  that  there  is  a  distinct  and  telling   difference  between  Melbourne  and  Sydney.   “In  Melbourne,  they  are  dispersed  throughout  the  city,  and  are  much  more  integrated  into  the  general  fab  ric  of  life.  But  in  Sydney,  the  Muslims  are  concentrated  in  a  few  suburbs,  which  they  have  turned  into  virtual  kasbahs.  These  people  haven’t  moved  to  Australia  -  they’ve  brought   Lebanon  into  Australia.”   Contrary  to  Professor  Israeli’s  advice  to  cap  Muslim  immigration  to  Australia,  Dr  Kedar  recommends  the  authorities  “prevent  the  creation  of  Muslim  clusters”  and  compel  immi  grants  to  integrate  with  society  as  a   whole.   “Ninety-nine  per  cent  of  the  Mus  lims  are  good  people,  who  come  here  to  make  a  living,”  he  said.  “The  prob  lem  is  with  a  small  group  of  radicals”,  who  were  either  radicalised  in  their  home  country-  in  which  case  he  said  they  should  be  kept  out  -  or  who  are  second-generation  immigrants  who  have  become  radicalised  here.   “They  feel  they  have  nowhere  to  return  to,  so  if  they  feel  rejected  by  general  society,  they  are  neither  here  nor  there,  and  the  only  place  that  will  accept  them  is  the  mosque  and  the  only  one  who  will  talk  to  them  seri  ously  is  Sheikh  [Tajeddin]  al-Hilaly.” ",2007-03-09
"  Controversial  Israeli  expert  on  Islam  draws  sell-out  audiences   JASON  FRENKEL   CONTROVERSIAL  Islam  expert  Pro  fessor  Raphael  Israeli  has  delivered  two  sell-out  lectures  in  Melbourne  -  but  avoided  the  question  of  whether  his  grim  warnings  about  Muslim  pop  ulation  growth  in  Europe  also  applied   to  Australia.   Professor  Israeli,  a  Hebrew  Univer  sity  academic  with  more  than  20  books  to  his  name,  told  more  than  360  people  on  Sunday  night  that  Islam  was  at  odds  with  the  fundamental  pil  lars  that  support  a  democracy.   In  a  talk  sponsored  by  Issues  of  Concern  for  Justice  and  Society  (ICJS),  he  said  a  clash  between  the  Koran  and  democratic  principles  was  inevitable  because  of  Islam’s  rigid   adherence  to  shari’a  law.   Earlier,  he  told  a  separate  audience  of  about  350  people  that  Turkey’s  pos  sible  entry  into  the  European  Union  (EU)  could  cause  a  major  headache  for  Europe,  effectively  doubling  the  EU’s  Muslim  population.   Organisers  of  the  ICJS  function  said  about  40  people  were  turned  away.  The  two  talks  proceeded  despite  a  major  controversy  over  Professor  Israeli’s  visit,  triggered  when  the  visit  ing  academic  told  the  AJNhe  believed  the  Australian  Government  should   place  a  cap  on  Muslim  immigrants.   One  of  the  primary  sponsors  of  the  trip,  the  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council,  withdrew  its  support  following  a  storm  of  protest  over  the   comments.   “I  found  Professor  Israeli's  myopic   pronouncements,  along  with  his  pejorative   remarks  disguised  as   humour,  both  distasteful  and  disturbing”   I  MARCIA  PINSKIER   Commissioner,  Victorian  Multicultural  Commission   But  the  State  Zionist  Council  of  Victoria  (SZCV)  and  the  Australian  Friends  of  the  Hebrew  University  con  tinued  to  back  the  scholar,  as  did  the  Shalom  Institute  at  the  University  of  NSW,  which  initially  brought  the  aca   demic  to  Australia  as  a  scholar-in-res  idence.   Although  Professor  Israeli’s  addresses  in  Sydney  and  Melbourne  have  been  well  received,  Marcia  Pin  skier,  the  commissioner  of  the  Victori  an  Multicultural  Commission  -  who   Professor  Raphael  Israeli  spoke  at  two  sell-out  functions  In  Melbourne  last  week,   but  he  avoided  the  Issue  of  Australia.  Photo:  Peter  Haskin   attended  Israeli’s  speech  -  told  the  AJN:  “I  found  Professor  Israeli’s  myopic  pronouncements,  along  with  his  pejorative  remarks  disguised  as  humour,  both  distasteful  and  disturbing.”   Members  of  Zionist  youth  move  ment  Habonim  Dror  protested  the  SZCV’s  support  of  Professor  Israeli  last  Wednesday  night,  handing  out  fly   ers  critical  of  his  remarks  and  the   council’s  decision  to  give  them  voice.   “As  an  affiliate  of  the  SZCV,  we  express  our  deepest  disappointment  at  the  council’s  decision  to  co-sponsor   this  event,”  the  flyer  said.  “The  sugges  tion  that  Australia  should  cap  Muslim  immigration  to  our  country  is  racist  and  an  allegation  that  we  find  deeply  offensive  and  counterproductive.  We  consider  [it]  an  unwelcome  interven  tion  in  Australian  policy  that  should  not  be  promoted  by  visiting  guests.”   But  SZCV  president  Dr  Danny  Lamm  defended  his  group’s  decision  to  sponsor  the  talk.  “I  think  reasonable  people  can  approach  things  in  different  ways.  I  thought  we  would  gain  immeasurably  by  having  him   address  us.” ",2007-03-16
"  The  world  according  td  Brigitte  Gabriel   Jason  Frenkel  discusses  the  threat  of  Islam  during  a  controversial  interview  with  journal  ist  Brigitte  Gabriel.   IN  the  interview,  Brigitte  Gabriel  says:  “When  you  hear  about  all  the  contributions  of  Islam  to  the  world,  algebra  and  all  that...   “Did  you  know  that  the  people,  the  inven  tors  who  contributed  that  to  the  world,  were  not  Muslims...

"  HUMMOUS  TO  CAIRO   THE  threat  of  the  looming  attack  by  Iran  and  Israel’s  supposed  air  strike  is  capturing  all  the  headlines  today,  and  of  course  the  Gaza  situation,  but  in  the  meantime,  for  28  years,  Egypt’s  military  has  been  receiving  a  $US2  billion  military  aid  package  from  the  United  States,  as  a  reward  for  having  signed  a  peace  accord  with  Israel  -  without  so  much  as  a  whimper  being  heard  from  the  media.  Of  course,  the  aid  package  is  not  as  large  as  Israel’s,  but  nevertheless  the  Egyptian  mili  tary  has  been  able  to  procure  the  latest  technology  the  West  has  to  offer.   I  ask  why  does  Egypt  need  such  a  large  amount  of  military  aid?  Is  there  a  country  on  its  border  that  is  a  potential  threat?  Is  it  Sudan,  Chad,  Libya,  Tunisia  etc.  etc.?   Granted,  Egypt  has  a  large  and  restless  Muslim  population  and  the   Muslim  fundamentalists  and  terror   ists  are  gaining  ground,  so  the  gov   emment  does  need  some  assistance.   But  two  billion  dollars  a  year  to  combat  terrorists,  with  all  the  latest  weapons,  including  missiles,  jets  and   tanks  -  that  seems  excessive.   With  President  Bush’s  drive  to  “democratise  the  Middle  East  “lam   afraid  that  if  Egypt’s  national  assembly  ever  holds  a  free  and  trans  parent  election,  lo  and  behold,  the  Muslim  fundamentalists  will  gain  a  majority  in  government.  What  will  happen  then?  They  will  be  in  posses  sion  of  28  years  of  arms  build-up  by  the  Egyptian  military,  all  with  the  acquiescence  the  US  Congress,  freely  doling  out  money  to  buy  weapons  that  Egypt  might  one  day  turn   towards  the  State  of  Israel.   Sure,  Israel  needs  peace  with  Egypt   and  I  am  sure  the  US  Government   needed  to  entice  then-president  Anwar  Sadat  to  sign  a  peace  accord   with  Israel  that  would  look   favourable  to  the  Egyptian  masses.   But  does  it  have  to  be  at  the  cost  of   Israel’s  security?  Couldn’t  they  just  send  tons  of  pita  and  hummous  as  an  aid  package  instead  of  tanks  and  bombs?  It  might  not  meet  everyone’s  culinary  taste,  but  it  at  least  it  does  not  endanger  Israel.   URI  BUTNARU  Bondi  North,  NSW ",2007-07-06

Indonesians  make   historic  visit  to  Israel   PETER  KOHN   AN  Australian-brokered  visit   by  seven  senior  Indonesian  journalists  to  Israel  has  helped  break  down  stereotypes  and  misconceptions  about  a  country  with  which  the  world’s  most  populous  Muslim  nation  has  no  diplomatic  ties.   The  six-day  visit  last  month  was  organised  by  the  Aus  tralia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Committee  (AIJAC)  and  the  American  Jewish  Committee.   AIJAC  executive  director  Dr  Colin  Rubenstein  told  The  AJN  that  Australia  is  uniquely  placed  to  build  bridges  between   Indonesia’s  media  and  Israeli  society.   “They  were  a  group  of  very  senior  journalists  with  great  political  contacts  and  influence   on  public  opinion.  They  were  greatly  impressed  by  the  diver  sity  of  Israeli  society  and  of  the  complexities  of  the  issues,”  he   said.   The  delegation,  which  included  four  Muslims,  a  Hindu  and  a  Christian,  met   Foreign  Minister  Tzipi  Livni   and  President  Shimon  Peres,  Israeli  media,  Palestinian  Authority  figures  and  journal  ists,  and  Israeli  Arab  leaders.   Livni  told  the  journalists  it  was  important  for  Indonesia  to  be  a  force  for  moderation  in  the  Middle  East   Peres  said  during  a  meeting  with  the  group:  “Our  enemies  are  not  the  Muslim  or  Arab  world.  Our  enemies  are  hatred  and  terror.”   The  delegation  took  part  in   Friday  morning  prayers  at  the  Al-Aqsa  Mosque  in  Jerusalem   and  observed  erev  Shabbat   worshippers  at  the  Western   Wall.   A  helicopter  tour  of  Israel  took  them  to  Sderot  -  where   they  saw  an  Israeli  observation  post  on  the  Gaza  border  -  to  the  Golan  Heights,  the  Lebanese  border  and  over  Jerusalem.   It  was  the  first  visit  to  Israel   for  all  the  journalists.   Dr  Rubenstein  said   Indonesia  has  undergone  sig  nificant  liberalisation  and  is  taking  its  place  as  a  moderate  force  in  the  Muslim  world.   “It’s  a  much  freer  society  in  Indonesia.  There’s  a  lot  of  interest  in  the  Middle  East  and  the  country  is  intent  on  playing  a  significant  role,”  he  said. ",2007-11-02
"  Anjranfen  Koran  from  file  12tfi-l3Si  watercolours  on  paper  ...  it  is   Professor  Nasser  D  Khalili  owns  over  20,000  Islamic   artworks,  the  largest  private  collection  of  its  kind   worldwide.  NICOLE  BRESKiN  asks  the  billionaire  art  dealer  what  makes  ancient  Korans  so  special  to  someone  who  reads  the  Torah.   Iranian-born  Professor  fiasser  D  Khalil!  at  the  launch  of  Tim  Arts  of  Islam  at  the  Art  Gallery  of  NSW  late  last  month.   are  so  many  of  them,  and  one  is  precious,  rare  and  e.  There  is  a  playful-looking  »e  burner  in  the  shape  of  an  lynx,  dated  to  12th-century  Iran;  an  Iraqi  bowl  with  lustre  decoration  from  the  9th-10th  century;  and  panels  of  painted  artwork,  one  from  the  17th  century,  depicting  an  elephant  fight  in  India.   There  are  at  least  30  fragments  of  care  fully-scripted  Korans  from  across  the  Middle  East,  Mesopotamia  and  Northern  Africa,  dating  from  700  AD,  when  it  was  said  that  God’s  revelations  to  the  Prophet  Mohammed   were  first  recorded.   There  is  an  entire  room  dedicated  to  art  works  pertaining  to  prayer  and  pilgrimage,  which  is  considered  most  important  to  the  practice  of  Islam.   There  are  lights  illuminated  in  the  shape  of  a  mosque’s  roof  in  the  centre  of  this  space,  with  an  Iranian  cenotaph  underneath  that  is  used  for  the  burial  of  a  Muslim  saint.   Meanwhile,  Islamic  music  plays  over  a  sound  system  in  this  section  of  the  gallery.   There  are  350  Islamic  relics  altogether  on  display  at  the  Art  Gallery  of  NSW  for  The  Arts  of  Islam  exhibition.  The  artworks  span  from  the  7th-20th  century  and  offer  an  intimate  and  largely  unseen  view  of  Islam  and  objects   central  to  life  in  the  Arab  world.   The  Arts  of  Islam  is  the  largest  and  most  comprehensive  exhibition  of  Islamic  works  that  has  ever  come  to  Australia.   But  the  relics  that  can  be  viewed  at  the  Art  Gallery  of  NSW  make  up  only  a  small  portion  of  the  Islamic  art  owned  by  Professor  Nasser  D  Khalili,  who  is  a  prominent  overseas  busi  nessman,  academic  and  scholar.   The  62-year-old  billionaire  owns  each  of  the  items  on  display,  along  with  no  less  than  20,000  Islamic  relics  and  artworks  -  the  largest  privately-owned  collection  of  its  kind   in  the  world.   Professor  Khalili,  who  last  month  travelled  to  Sydney  to  promote  the  exhibition,  describes  each  Islamic  artwork  with  such   profound  knowledge  not  only  of  its  historical  significance,  but  also  its  religious  back  ground.  He  sounds  as  though  he  were  an   adherent  to  the  faith.   He  adds  that  one  of  the  utmost  reasons  he  brought  the  exhibition  to  Australia,  which  has  also  travelled  across  Europe,  was  to  ben  efit  the  local  Muslim  community.   “The  Muslim  community  in  Australia  needs  a  bit  of  support  of  seeing  their  own  cul  ture.  I’m  happy  to  bring  these  artworks  here,  it’s  a  good  move.”   It  wouldn’t  be  a  huge  stretch  to  take  Professor  Khalili  for  a  Muslim.  But  he  is,  in  fact,  Jewish.   s  ;s,  “  You  can  see  that  the   artworks  are  f  aesthetically  beautiful.   It  just  so  happens  that  &gt;  they’re  used  for  prayer”   PROFESSOR  NASSER  0  KHALILI   Art  collector   And  so,  when  I  ask  Professor  Khalili  what  drives  him  to  amass  so  much  Islamic  artwork   and  promote  a  Muslim  cause,  as  a  Jew  no  less,  his  answer  is,  at  first,  surprising  for   someone  who  owns  several  hundred  Korans.   “Kiddush  Hashem.  Have  you  heard  this  before?”  he  says,  seemingly  ironically.  “It  means  ‘to  sanctify  the  name  of  God’,  and  that  every  human  being  must  have  respect  for  one  another.   “Judaism  and  Islam  are  two  of  the  closest  religions.  There  are  more  similarities  between  them  than  any  other  religions.   “At  the  end  of  day,  we’re  cousins.  And  if  I  do  something  for  either  one,  it’s  because  of  that:  kiddush  Hashem.”   He  explains  that  people  need  not  be  of  any   religious  or  cultural  background  to  have  a  passion  for  Islamic  artwork.   Compared  to  the  other  religious  artworks  that  hang  in  the  Art  Gallery  -  the  Michelangelos,  Giottos  and  da  Vincis  -  he  says  his  own  collection  does  not  stick  only  to  a  religious  Orthodoxy.   “Unlike  the  Christian  artwork  that  is  made,  Islamic  art  is  90  per  cent  secular.  The  [Islamic]  works  [on  display]  are  mostly  sec  ular,  but,  more  importantly,  they  are  also  beautiful  and  anyone  can  appreciate  that.”   But  he  also  says  that  anyone  can  appre  ciate  the  religious  artworks  on  display  too,  which  include  the  ancient  Korans  and  prayer  rugs.   “You  can  see  that  the  artworks  are  aes   thetically  beautiful.  It  just  so  happens  that  they’re  used  for  prayer.”   ROFESSOR  Khalili  was  bom  in  Iran  in   §|1945.  He  was  given  the  Hebrew  name   David,  which  he  also  goes  by  today.   Twas  bom  with  two  names:  a  Hebrew  name  and  a  Muslim  name.  I  guess  I  prefer  to  be  called  Nasser,  because  that  was  the  name  I  was  first  called  at  birth,  but  I  don’t  mind.   “Some  people  call  me  Nasser,  some  people  call  me  David.  I  go  by  both,”  he  says.   Professor  Khalili  asserts  that  he  never  experienced  religious  persecution  as  a  Jewish  child  growing  up  in  an  Arab  country,  despite  the  antisemitism  that  followed  his   time  in  Iran.   “Iranian  Jews  have  the  longest  history  of  all  Jews  in  world.  We  had  all  rights  to  practise  religion.”   Professor  Khalili  attended  a  Jewish  school  in  Tehran,  but  had  several  friends  who  were  Muslim.   “I  never  felt  that  because  I  was  a  Jew  I  shouldn’t  have  Muslim  friends.  And  on  Jewish  holidays,  my  Muslim  friends  would  come  to  my  home  to  celebrate,  and  on  Muslim  holidays,  I  would  go  to  them.”   Professor  Khalili  says  he  was  given  “every  opportunity”  as  a  young  man  in  Iran.  He   wrote  his  first  book  at  age  14  on  world  geniuses.   But  in  1967,  he  relocated  to  the  United  States  to  continue  his  education  at  Queens  College  in  New  York,  and  left  his  family  behind.  Although  admitting  that  life  in  the  West  was  considerably  different  to  what  he  had  been  accustomed  to,  Professor  Khalili  expressed  ease  at  assimilating  into  a  new   culture.   “I  had  no-one  in  America,  but  you  adapt.  It  offered  more  opportunities,  so  I  just  had  to  take  risks  and  stay  honest.  And  keep  my  beliefs  alive.”   And  it  was  when  Professor  Khalili  was  in  the  thick  of  relocating  to  the  United  States  that  he  acquired  his  first  artwork:  an  Islamic  lacquer  work  from  the  19th  century.   “I  was  born  into  Islamic  art,  the  first  art  works  I  saw  were  Islamic.  But  I  chose  that  first  piece  of  artwork  because  I  saw  some  thing  in  it  that  was  very  beautiful.”   From  there,  Professor  Khalili,  a  real-estate  investor,  began  amassing  a  wide-range  of  art  works,  including  Japanese  art  from  the  Meji  period,  Swedish  textiles  from  the  1700-1900s  and  Spanish  damascened  metalwork.   But  his  passion  and  what  he  owns  the  most  is  Islamic  art,  which  he  has  collected  under  the  auspices  of  The  Khalili  Family  Trust  that  he  established  in  1970.   In  1978,  Professor  Khalili  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom,  where  he  received  a  PhD  in  Islamic  lacquerware  from  the  University  of  London  and  there  he  founded,  and  now  sup  ports,  a  chair  in  Islamic  art,  the  first  of  its  kind  at  any  university.   Despite  having  more  than  25,000  pieces  of  artwork  to  his  name,  Professor  Khalili  says  he  barely  has  a  dozen  artworks  in  his  own  home.   “They’re  not  for  personal  pleasure.  I  col  lected  to  share,”  he  says.   The  Art  Gallery  of  NSW’s  director,  Edmund  Capon,  was  so  impressed  by   Professor  Khalili  and  his  collection  that  he  made  a  personal  visit  to  see  him  at  his  London  home  four  years  ago.  The  current  exhibition  has  been  in  the  making  ever  since.   In  preparation  for  the  show,  the  Art  Gallery  of  NSW  tightened  security  to  a  level  it  had  previously  not  reached  for  a  travelling  exhibition  -  not  because  the  works  are  reli  gious,  but  because  they  are  so  rare.  The  top  notch  security  measures  have  trumped  the  procedures  taken  to  ensure  works  of  European  masters,  including  Renoir,  Picasso  and  van  Gogh.   And  now  that  the  exhibition  is  showing,  an  Art  Gallery  of  NSW  spokesperson  also  said  that  the  exhibition  has  seen  crowds  compa  rable  to  those  at  this  year’s  Archibald  Portrait  Prize  show  on  weekends.   It  has  been  hailed  as  not  just  portraying  a  side  of  Islam  that  has  not  yet  been  captured,  but  promoting  inter-faith  understanding.   “The  very  word  Islam  casts  both  light  and  shadow  over  our  contemporary  world,”  Capon  says.   “The  power  of  art  can  open  our  minds.  One  is  indeed  moved  to  consider  how  our  modern  world  would  be  blessed  if  it  could  rid  of  the  radical  religious  fundamentalisms  that  so  distort  faiths  and  derail  the  causes  of  humanity  and  tolerance.   “Such  musings  would,  I  suspect,  find  a  sympathetic  ear  in  one  individual  above  all...  Professor  Nasser  D  Khalili,”  he  says.   Professor  Khalili  actively  supports  inter  faith  causes.  He  founded  the  Maimonides  Foundation,  which  promotes  peace  and   understanding  between  Jews  and  Muslims  through  the  arts.   In  1966,  he  was  honoured  with  the  title  Trustee  of  the  City  of  Jerusalem  by  the  Israeli  Government  for  his  pursuit  of  cul   ture  and  peace  ,ffiP5jSgga|   among  nations.   Pope  John  Paul  II  granted   him  an  audience  at   the  Vatican  in  2002,   when  he  bestowed  on  him  the   Pontificia  for  his  inter-faith  work.   Professor  Khalili   hopes  to  reform  inter   national  dialogue  on  Jews  and  Muslims,  which  he  says  is  generally  far  too  negative.   “The  world  should  stop  constantly  telling  the  Middle  East  what  it  is  doing  wrong,  but  what  it’s  doing  right,  in  their  contribution  to  the  sciences  and  arts  of  the  West,”  he  says.   Although  he  is  involved   with  Jewish  cultural  organisations   around  the  world,  Professor  Khalili  does  not  own  any  Israeli  or  Jewish  artwork.   “I  don’t  collect  what  other  people  already  have.  There’s  a  lot  of  it  around,  and  people  have  done  it  before.  I  wanted  to  fill  a  void  in  the  collecting  world.  What  I  am  col  lecting  fills  that  void.”   Despite  his  high-profile  background  and   A  saddle  fitting  (left)  with  gold  sheets  from  Asia,  1200  AD;  a  narrow-necked  Iranian  flask  with  turquoise  glaze  from  the  15th-16th  century.   A  cabinet  from  17th-century  Goa.   desire  for  cross-cultural  and  inter-faith  change,  Professor  Khalili  insists  he  would  never  get  involved  in  politics.   “Politics  have  no  place  in  my  life.  I  say  that  religion  and  politics  have  their  own  lan  guages,  but  the  language  of  art  is  universal.”   The  Arts  of  Islam  is  on  exhibition  until  September  23  at   the  Art  Gallery  of  NSW.

According  to  The  Wall  Street  Jour-  nal,  Mazen  Asbahi  quit  on  Monday  because  he  did  not  want  to  be  a  “dis-  traction’’  to  the  presidential  campaign  of  US  Senator  Barack  Obama.   Asbahi,  a  prominent  Chicago  lawyer,  had  served  on  the  board  of  the  Allied  Assets  Advisers  Fund  affiliated  with  the  North  American  Islamic  Trust  for  a  few  weeks  in  2000.   Also  serving  on  the  board  at  that   time  was  Jamal  Said,  an  imam  at  a  Chicago-area  mosque,  known  for  his   radical  views.   Said  allegedly  raised  funds  for  the  defence  of  figures  charged  with  fundraising  for  Hamas.  Said  was  named  an  unindicted  co-conspirator  in  that  case,  which  ended  in  a  mistrial  last  year.   ""I  served  on  that  board  for  only  a  few  weeks  before  resigning  as  soon  as  I  became  aware  of  public  allegations  against  another  member  of  the  board,""  Asbahi  said  in  his  resignation  letter.

"  Renowned  Muslim  professor  to  visit   SHARON  BERGER   PROFESSOR  Israel  Gershoni  (pictured)  will  offer  two  three  week  courses  on  Arab  nationalism  and  radical  polit  ical  Islam  during  his  second  visit  to  Australia  in  Sep  tember.  A  distin   guished  professor   at  the  Tel  Aviv  university  Middle  tasxern  and  African  History  Department,  Prof  Gershoni  will  speak  at  the  Shalom  Institute  in  Sydney  from  the  beginning  of  September.   Prof  Gershoni  has  received  multiple   accolades,  including  a  Fulbright  Fellow  ship,  and  has  lectured  all  over  the  world,  including  Oxford  and  Harvard  universities.  He  has  published  more  than  20  books  on  Arab  intellectual  cultural  history.   This  week,  the  prolific  author's  most  recent  book,  Narrating  the  Nile:  Politics,  Cultures,  Identities  was  released  in  the  United  States.  It  takes  a  fresh  look  at  the  politics  and  cultures  of  the  Nile  Valley,  and  the  river's  role  in  shaping  them.   Prof  Gershoni  is  also  working  on  a  book  in  English  and  Hebrew,  in  which  he  studies  attitudes  towards  facism,  Nazism  and  Islam  in  the  Arab  world.  He  believes  the  tendency  to  put  them  together  mis  represents  them.   Prof  Gershoni  told  The  AJN  shortly  before  leaving  for  Australia  with  his  wife   Shani  that  he  hoped  his  courses  would  provide  context  for  Australian  audiences  in  better  understanding  current  issues,  such  as  Islamic  radicalism  and  nation  alism.  This  includes  not  only  Arab  nation  alism,  he  said,  but  country  specific  types  in  Egypt,  Palestine,  Lebanon  and  elsewhere.   His  courses  will  examine  the  develop  ment  of  Arab  nationalism  and  political  Islam  from  the  mid-19th  century  until  today,  and  will  “compare  between  circles  of  identity,  as  well  as  put  Islamic  radi  calism  in  historic  proportions”.

"  Jews  react  to  Muslim  school  veto   MICHELLE  COLEMAN   THE  Sydney  Jewish  community  has  reacted  to  the  Camden  Council’s  rejection  of  an  applica  tion  for  a  Muslim  school  on  Tuesday,  over  con   cerns  it  was  due  to  anti-Muslim  sentiment.   Vic  Alhadeff,  CEO  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  said:  “We  welcome  the  assurance  by  Camden  Council  that  its  rejection  of  an  application  for  a  Muslim  school  was  based  on  planning  considerations  and  was  not  influenced  by  race  or  religion.”   “As  a  principle,”  Alhadeff  said,  “we  support  the  right  of  communities  to  have  faith-based   schools”  and  “we  categorically  condemn  any  expressions  of  racism  directed  against  any  faith  or  ethnic  community”.   Alhadeff  added  that  he  hoped  dialogue  would  take  place  between  those  proposing  and  opposing  the  school  in  an  effort  to  overcome  any  prejudice  that  may  exist  He  said  if  the  dialogue  was  successful,  the  project  should  commence.   Burak  Mete,  a  Muslim  living  in  the  Camden  area,  told  The  AJN  that  he  appreciated  Alhadeff’s  comments,  but  that  anti-Muslim  sentiments  expressed  by  local  residents  appeared  to  be  the  real  reason  for  the  rejection  of  the  proposal.

"  Growing  worry  over  religious   freedom  in  Muslim  countries   MARC  PERELMAN   WASHINGTON  -  The  United  States  and  European  governments  are  ramping  up  efforts  to  counter  what  they  see  as  a  campaign  by  Muslim  countries  to  suppress  speech  about  religion,  especially  Islam.   The  debate  focuses  on  a  United  Nations  resolution  called  Combat  ing  Defamation  of  Religion,  spon  sored  by  the  57-nation  Organisation   of  the  Islamic  Conference.   The  resolution  was  adopted  by  die  UN  General  Assembly  in  2005  and  is  up  for  renewal  in  the  next  couple  of  months.   While  the  resolution  stresses  the  need  to  fight  defamation  against  all  faiths,  Islam  is  the  only  one  explic   itly  mentioned.  Both  the  European  Union  and  the  United  States,  which  have  treaded  carefully  in  recent  years  to  avoid  being  perceived  as  anti-Muslim,  have  come  out  strongly  against  this  resolution  as   well  as  similar  efforts  in  other  UN  bodies.   Although  such  resolutions  are  not  binding,  there  is  mounting  con   cern  in  western  countries  that  Mus   lim  regimes  are  using  a  series  of  high-profile  incidents,  most  notably  the  outrage  provoked  by  the  news  paper  publication  of  caricatures  of  Mohammed  in  Denmark,  to  stifle  free  speech  and  divert  attention  from  their  own  repression  of  reli  gious  freedom  at  home.

"  One-third  of  UK  Muslim  students  back  jihad   JONNY  PAUL   LONDON  -  Nearly  one-third  of  British  Muslim  students  polled  in  a  new  report  said  that  killing  in  the  name  of  religion  could  be  justified.   The  report  by  the  London-based  Centre  for  Social  Cohesion  (CSC),  entitled  “Islam  on  campus:  A  survey  of  UK  student  opinion”,  showed  that  32  per  cent  of  Muslim  students  said  killing  in  the  name  of  religion  could  be  justified,  while  60  per  cent  of  active  members  of  on-campus  Islamic  soci  eties  said  the  same.  Only  two  per  cent  of  non-Muslims  polled  felt  this  way.   Based  on  a  specially  commis  sioned  poll  of  1400  students,  as  well  as  on  field  work  and  interviews,  the  report  showed  that  most  Muslim  stu  dents  supported  secularism  and  dem  ocratic  values,  were  generally  tolerant  of  other  minorities,  and  rejected   Jewish  students  In  the  UK  will  have  more  than  an  academic  boycott  against  Israel   on  their  plate  as  new  reports  shows  extremism  Increasing  among  Muslim  students.

However,  the  report  also  revealed  high  levels  of  support  for  the  adop   tion  of  shari’a  law  into  British  law,  and  a  worldwide  caliphate.   Forty  per  cent  or  Muslim  students  polled  supported  the  introduction  of   shari’a  law  into  British  law  for  Mus  lims,  and  one-third  supported  the  introduction  of  a  worldwide  caliphate   based  on  shari’a  law;  58  per  cent  of  active  members  of  Islamic  societies  supported  the  idea.   In  addition,  43  per  cent  of  Muslim  students  said  Islam  was  compatible   with  secularism.   “These  findings  are  deeply  alarming,”  said  CSC  researcher  Hannah  Stuart,  one  of  the  report’s  authors.  “Students  in  higher  educa  tion  are  the  future  leaders  of  their  communities.  Yet  significant  numbers  of  them  appear  to  hold  beliefs  that  contravene  liberal,  democratic  values.  In  addition,  there  are  signs  of  growing  religious  segregation  on  campus.  These  results  are  deeply  embarrassing  for  those  who  have  said  that  there  is  no  extremism  in  British  universities.”   The  report  recommends  that  the  government,  university  authorities  and  the  Muslim  community  act  to   address  these  problems.

"  Report:  Muslim  anti-Semitism  ‘strategic  threat’  to  Israel   HAVSVREfTIG   JERUSALEM  -  Muslim  anti-Semitism  is  growing  in  scope  and  extremism,  to  the  point  that  it  has  become  a  credible  strategic  threat  for  Israel,  according  to  a  180-page  report  produced  for  Israeli  policymakers  by  the  Intelligence  and   Terrorism  Information  Centre  (ITIC).   According  to  the  report,  released  on  Tuesday,  by  educating  generations  of  Muslims  with  a  deep  animus  toward  Israel  and  Jews,  this  anti  Semitism,  actively  promulgated  by  many  states  in  the  region,  holds  back  the  peace  process  and  normalisation  efforts  between  Israel  and  Muslim  countries.  It  also  forms  the  intellec  tual  justification  for  an  eliminationist  political  program.   “This  isn’t  ordinary  prejudice,”  explained  ITIC  director  Colonel  (reserve)  Dr  Reuven  Erlich  -  formerly   of  the  Israel  Defence  Force’s  Intelli  gence  Directorate,  who  heads  the  researchers  that  produced  the  report.  The  report  is  a  comprehensive  exam   ination  of  anti-Semitism  in  the   Muslim  world,  with  emphasis  on  Iran   and  Arab  states.   Among  the  report’s  most  wor  rying  findings  is  the  growth  over  the   Demonstrators  In  Paris  use  an  anti-war  march  as  an  opportunity  to  express  anti   Semitic  sentiments.   past  three  decades  of  uniquely  Muslim  roots  to  older  European   versions  of  anti-Semitism.  Without  discounting  classical  Christian  Europe’s  canards  regarding  Jews,  anti   Semitism  in  the  Muslim  world  increasingly  finds  its  own  Islamic  reasons  for  anti-Jewish  hatred  through  new  interpretations  of  Islamic  history  and  scripture.   From  the  Koranic  story  of  a  Jewess  who  poisoned  Mohammad,  to  the  troubled  relations  between   rnuw,  Jin   Mohammad  and  the  Jewish  tribes  of  Arabia,  radical  Islamist  groups  and  thinkers  have  been  using  extreme  anti-Semitic  rhetoric  that  has  grown  increasingly  popular  with  the  Muslim  public.  Using  well-known  Koranic  texts,  these  groups  have  been  mapping  out  the  Jews’  “innate  nega  tive  attributes”  and  teaching  a  paradigm  of  permanent  struggle  between  Muslims  and  Jews.   The  goal  of  this  “Islamified”  anti   Semitism  is  to  transform  the  Israeli   Palestinian  conflict  from  a  national  territorial  contest,  which  could  be  resolved  through  compromise,  to  a  “historic,  cultural  and  existential  struggle  for  the  supremacy  of  Islam”.   The  research  team  did  not  deal  with  “anti-Israel  incitement”,  according  to  Erlich,  “only  with  anti  Semitism.  Until  about  10-15  years  ago,  anti-Semitism  was  imported  into   the  Muslim  Arab  world  from   Europe,”  says  Erlich.  “Over  the  past  10-15  years,  there’s  been  a  deep  change.  Today  it  isn’t  an  import,  but  an  export....  We’re  convinced  that  the  export  of  anti-Semitic  myths  and  politics  to  Europe  is  having  an  effect  on  European  Muslim  communities.”   At  the  heart  of  this  surge  in  Muslim  anti-Semitism  lies  Iran,  with  the  regime’s  support  for  Holocaust  denial  and  hosting  of  anti-Semites,  along  with  formal  calls  for  Israel’s  destruction  by  many  of  the  country’s   leaders.   “Iran  is  the  first  example  of  its  kind  since  Nazi  Germany  in  which  a  state  officially  adopts  an  active  policy   of  anti-Semitism  as  a  means  to  further  its  national  interests,”  the  report  says.

"  US  report:   Muslim  states,  UN  fuel  anti  Semitism   HILARY  LEILA  KRIEGER   WASHINGTON  DC  -  There  has  been  an  upsurge  in  anti-Semitism  over  the  past  decade  -  much  of  it  a  new  form  whose  “distinguishing  feature”  is  criticism  of  Israel,  according  to  a  recently  released  US  State  Department  report   The  94-page  report  was  compiled  by  Special  Envoy  to  Monitor  and  Combat  Anti-Semitism  Gregg  Rickman,  who  was  in  Australia  earlier  in  the  year  to  learn  about  the  recent  upsurge  in   anti-Semitic  incidents.   The  report  criticises  many  Muslim  and  Arab  countries  for  encouraging  anti-Semitism,  and  an  entire  chapter  is  devoted  to  anti-Semitism  at  the  United  Nations.  It  reads:""...  Regardless  of  the  intent,  disproportionate  criticism  of  Israel  as  barbaric  and  unprincipled,  and  corresponding  discriminatory  measures  adopted  in  the  UN  against  Israel,  have  the  effect  of  causing  audi  ences  to  associate  negative  attributes  with  Jews  in  general,  thus  fueling  anti   Semitism.”   While  the  report  notes  that  tradi  tional  forms  of  anti-Semitism  continue  to  be  found  across  the  globe,  “anti  Semitism  has  proven  to  be  an  adaptive  phenomenon”.   The  new  forms  often  incorporate  elements  of  traditional  anti-Semitism,  but  “the  distinguishing  feature  of  the  new  anti-Semitism  is  criticism  of  Zionism  or  Israeli  policy  that  -  whether  intentionally  or  unintentionally  -  has  the  effect  of  promoting  prejudice  against  all  Jews  by  demonising  Israel  and  Israelis  and  attributing  Israel’s  per   ceived  faults  to  its  Jewish  character”.   The  document’s  introduction  singles  out  Iran  and  Syria  for  their  demonisa  tion  of  Jews,  and  adds,  ""Venezuela’s  government-sponsored  mass  media  have  become  vehicles  for  anti-Semitic  discourse,  as  have  government  news  media  in  Saudi  Arabia  and  Egypt.”   It  names  Britain,  France  and  Ger  many  as  European  countries  where  “anti-Semitic  violence  remains  a  signif  icant  concern”,  but  also  lists  other  western  nations  as  experiencing  recent  increases,  including  Argentina,  Australia  and  Canada.

From  Neve  Shaloni,  we  take  another  cab  through  the  insane  traffic  to  the  former  Jewish  quarter,  Balat,back  within  the  walls  of  the  old  city,  detouring  via  Sisii;  where  Naon  points  out  a  huge  Jewish  school.   ’•  These  daySj  Balat  is  ramshackle,  though  not  without  a  certain  charm.  Some  very  old  synagogues  are  quietly  going  to  seed  here  in  hidden  courtyards,  but  two  of  the  most  important  are  well  kept.   Built  by  Romaniot  Jews  in  the  15th  cen  tury,  the  magnificent  Ahrida  Synagogue  (named  after  the  town  of  its  founders,  Ohrid,  in  Macedonia)  predates  Ottoman  conquest,  is  the  oldest  synagogue  in  Istanbul  and  sports  a  distinctive  boat-shaped  teva  thought  to  recall  Noah’s  Ark.  In  addition  to  enjoying  higher  numbers  on  the  high  holy  days,  the  Ahrida  is   the  focus  of  Purim  festivities.   Likewise,  the  nearby  Yanbol  Synagogue  (named  after  Yanbol  in  Bulgaria),  built  in  Byzantine  times  and  renovated  most  recently  in  1875,  is  the  centre  of  Succot  cele  brations.  This  strategyis  employed  at  other  historic  synagogues,  where  there’s  no  dependable  daily  minyan.   Our  final  synagogue  stop  is  t]he  Etz  Hayyim  at  Ortakoy,  a  trendy  waterfront   suburb,  where  in  among  cafes  and  bars,  a  hundred-year-old  synagogue  complex  holds  its  own,  behind  a  high  wall,  under  a  courtyard  covered  with  per  spex  for  security.   Late  in  the  afternoon,  we   find  ourselves  in  Yusuf  Nalbant’s  tiny  kosher  butcher  shop,  on  an  upward-winding  street  in  the  chic  inner-city  district  of  Galata.  He’s  ordered  us  styeet,  strong  tea  from  his  local  seller  (on  the  house),  and  we  sip  from  the  sinuously  flared  glasses.  In  the  course  of  conversation,  we  tell  Naon  how  shocked  we  were  that  Jews  in  Istanbul  have  to  have  hard  hats  at  the  ready,  in  the  event  of  a  bombing-initiated  building  collapse.   “Oh,  no,”  she  chuckles.  “It’s  for  earthquakes.  Only  Jews  worry  so  much  -  no-one  else  has  them.” ",2008-12-26
"  :  let  tile   Following  the  Pope's   controversial  baptism  of  a  Muslim  man  this  Easter,   SAUL  SBftlGEIR  looks  at  the  historically  mistaken  notion   that  Judaism  resists  converts.   I  Today,  even  growth  at  a   rate  of  half-a-per  cent   each  year  would  have  a  significant  impact   because,  at  a  time  when  almost  all  Jews  are  effectively  ""Jews  by   choice”,  the  challenge  of  attracting  your  own  melds  with  that  of  attracting  others.   THIS  Easter,  controversy   swirled  around  Pope  Benedict  XVI,  both  for  personally  bap  tising  a  prominent  Muslim   Italian  journalist,  and  for  allowing  the   revived  Latin  mass  which  includes  a  prayer  for  the  conversion  of  Jewish  people.   Muslims  attacked  the  Pope  for  his  “provocative”  act.  Similarly,  regarding  the  Latin  mass,  German  Jewish  leader  Charlotte  Knobloch  said,  “I  would  have  assumed  that  this  German  pope,  of  all  people,  had  got  to  know  first  hand  the  ostracising  of  Jewry  ...  I  could  not  have  imagined  that  [he]  could  now  impose  such  phrases  upon   his  church.”   At  some  level,  I  understand  such  reactions.  Jews  have  seen  throughout  history  where  Christian  denials  of  Jewish  legitimacy  have  led.  And  it   could  well  seem  foolish  to  fuel  Mus   lim-Christian  rivalry  at  a  time  when  a   virulent  Islamic  strain  has  declared   war  on  other  religions.   But  I  still  understand  the  Pope  more  than  I  do  his  critics.  The  Pope  wants  Muslims  and  Jews  to  become  Christians.  It  is  normal  and  desirable   for  adherents  of  whatever  religion  to   believe  that  their  creed  is  best  for  them   -  and  others.  Healthy  competition  does  not  lead  inexorably  to  holy  war.   Obviously,  the  key  dividing  line  is   the  use  of  force  or  intimidation.  It  is   one  thing  to  recognise  that  not  every  one  is  bom  into  the  religion  that  is  right  for  them,  and  quite  another  to  compel  people  to  leave  a  religion  that  they,  given  free  choice,  would  con  tinue  to  practise.   Of  the  three  Abrahamic  religions,  Christianity  is  currently  the  closest  to  striking  the  right  balance.  Muslims   have  been  threatened  with  death  for  converting;  a  prominent  strain  of   German  Jewish  leader  Charlotte  Knobloch:  “I  would  have  assumed  that  this  German  pope,  of  all  people,  had  got  to  know  firsthand  the  ostracising  of  Jewry.”   Islam  is  attempting  to  spread  itself  by   force.   Judaism  has  gone  to  the  other  extreme.  Many  Jews  seem  to  believe,  and  are  even  proud  of,  the  historically  mistaken  notion  that  Judaism  resists   converts.   This  was  not  always  so.  Even  dur  ing  centuries  of  persecution,  when   conversion  could  mean  a  death  sen  tence,  Jews  continued  to  seek  and  welcome  converts.  When  rabbinic  opinion  turned  against  seeking  con  verts,  it  was  mainly  on  the  grounds  of  the  dangers  of  doing  so,  not  a  rejec  tion  of  the  welcoming  Jewish  ideal.   What  is  true  is  that  the  Jewish  model  of  affecting  the  world  is  fun  damentally  different  than  that  of  Christianity  and  Islam.  While  the  lat  ter  see  becoming  a  universal  religion  as  the  ideal,  and  numerical  growth  as  an  important  measure  of  achieving  God’s  will,  Judaism  has  a  more  par   ticularist  route  to  a  universalistic  end.   The  Jewish  model  is  not  that  all  people  should  become  Jews,  but  that   Jews  set  an  example  as  a  people  for  other  peoples  to  follow.   This  model  has  actually  worked  well,  in  that  Judaism  has,  through  Christianity  and  Islam,  brought  about  the  triumph  of  monotheism  over  paganism.  In  addition,  the  Jew  ish  idea  that  God  cares  about  ethics  and  improving  the  world  has  become  the  foundation  of  the  western  notion  of  progress,  and  thus  of  the  modem   world.   But  it  does  not  follow,  just  because  Jews  don’t  believe  that  everyone  needs  to  be  Jewish,  that  the  size  and  trajec  tory  are  irrelevant  to  Jewry.  As  a  tiny  people,  Jews,  even  more  than  Chris  tians  and  Muslims,  need  to  be  grow  ing  in  numbers.   There  is  no  doubt  that  if  the  Jew  ish  people  were  growing  at  a  modest  but  steady  clip,  this  would  be  a  source  of  pride  and  confidence.  Indeed,  the  last  time  Jewish  population  grew  sub  stantially  due  to  attracting  non-Jews,  not  just  natural  growth,  was  in  ancient  Israel,  when  Judaism  was  accomplishing  its  purpose  of  offering   an  alternative  way  of  thinking  and  life  that  changed  the  world.   Back  then,  the  Jewish  population  grew  by  about  16-fold  over  250  years  (to  one-eighth  of  the  population  of  the  Roman  Empire,  according  to  Salo  Baron)  -  an  implied  growth  rate  of  about  one  per  cent  per  year.   Today,  even  growth  at  a  rate  of  half-a-per  cent  each  year  would  have  a  significant  impact  because,  at  a  time  when  almost  all  Jews  are  effectively  “Jews  by  choice”,  the  challenge  of  attracting  your  own  melds  with  that  of  attracting  others.   The  great  (non-Jewish)  sociologist  Peter  Berger,  who  wrote  a  1979  article  in  commentary  endorsing  Reform   leader  Rabbi  Alexander  Schindler’s  call  to  reach  out  to  the  “unchurched”,  goes  even  further.  Seeking  converts  “is  now  no  longer  an  expression  of  institutional  strategy,  let  alone  of  reli  gious  arrogance  or  aggression.  On  a  more  basic  level,  it  is  an  imperative.   “Whether  the  engagement  with  the  outsider  actually  leads  to  conver  sions  ...  is  not  essential.  Rather,  what  is  essential  is  that  every  committed  indi  vidual,  and  every  community  of  such  individuals,  engage  with  all  the  signif   icant  alternatives.”   Berger’s  conclusion  for  all  reli  gions  is:  “You  will  not  be  able  to  keep  your  own  unless  you  are  prepared  to  persuade  others.”  But,  as  he  points  out,  even  more  significant  than  the  numbers  is  the  willingness  and  ability  to  persuade.   When  we  rediscover  our  purpose  of  affecting  the  world  directly  and  by  example  -  as  individuals,  families,  and  as  a  people  -  we  will  start  attract  ing  ourselves  and  others,  and  trans  form  the  current  vicious  cycle  of  decline  into  a  virtuous  cycle  of   growth.

"  As  Hebron  settlers  desecrate  Muslim  cemeteries  and   threaten  to  burn  people  in  their  homes,  it  is  timely  to  reflect  on  the  devastation   caused  by  pogroms  against  the  Jewish  people.   DISPATCHES  '   FROM  HOME   MARK  BAKER   RY  calling  a  Jew  a  Nazi,  or  the  Jewish  State  a  form  of  Judeo-Nazism,  and  the  H  wrath  of  the  community  will  descend  upon  you.   Yet,  a  fine  historical  distinction  has  been  drawn  these  days,  to  judge  by  the  epithets  used  to  describe  a  community  of  Jews  committing  acts  of  violence  against  Palestinians.  Last  week,  I  counted  no  less  than  five  arti  cles  in  Ha’aretz  (including  an  edito  rial)  that  referred  to  the  rioting  Hebron  youths  as  pogromists,  reserving  the  Nazi  tag  for  the  Mum  bai  terrorists.  Even  outgoing  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Olmert  was  com   pelled  to  resort  to  these  historical  parallelisms,  labelling  the  Hebron  riots  a  pogrom,  whose  Jewish  perpe  trators  must  be  mercilessly  stopped.   The  comparison  between  Jews  and  the  descendants  of  Bogdan  Chmielnicki  is  no  small  irony.  After  all,  Zionism  was  bom  less  out  of  the  Holocaust  than  amid  the  cyclical  turbulence  of  Russian  pogroms.   The  pogrom  is  backdrop  to  Zion  ist  awakening,  the  opening  chapter  in  the  memoirs  of  Israel’s  founders,  who  recall  parents  cowering  under  tables  or  barricading  ramshackle  doors  against  the  force  of  marauders  on  horseback.  These  stories  are  fash  ioned  to  demonstrate  that  Zionism   is  not  only  a  response  to  the  pogroms,  but  also  an  answer  to  it.   The  sovereign  Jew  no  longer  cow  ers  behind  doors,  but  holds  the  keys  to  usher  in  a  new  history.  The  native  born  sabra  stands  tall  and  armed,  a  masculine  warrior  who  answers   power  with  power.  Thus,  the  image  of  the  pogromist  has  always  been  buried  deep  in  the  psyche  of  Zion  ism,  scarring  the  modem  state  with  traumatic  memories.  Last  week,  the  wounds  reopened  and  the  Jewish  psyche  was  exposed  for  the  world  to  analyse.  In  the  Israeli  popular  imagi  nation,  the  sight  of  Jews  desecrating   Muslim  cemeteries  with  Stars  of  David  and  threatening  to  bum  fam  ilies  in  their  homes,  stirred  the  ancestral  demons  from  their  resting  places.  In  what  way  are  the  riots  not  a  pogrom,  suggested  Prime  Minister   Ehud  Olmert.   Yet,  in  the  mind  of  the  Hebron  settlers,  it  is  Olmert  and  the  state  that  trigger  images  from  the  past:  as  in  the  Gaza  disengagement,  the  government,  courts  and  army  are  evicting  Jews  from  their  homes  and  homeland,  making  the  territories  Judenrein  and  acting  like  obse  quious  leaders  from  a  shtetl.  The   state  has  become  the  new  gentile  enemy,  a  secular  tool  of  anti  Semitic  interests  that  has  betrayed  the  biblical  destiny  of  the  Chosen  People.   The  question  of  identity  struck  home  for  me  this  week  through  an  encounter  with  an  Australian  friend.  We  acknowledged  that  we  were  both  cut  from  the  same  cloth:  the  chil  dren  of  Holocaust  survivors,  who  took  refuge  in  Australia.  In  her  eyes,  the  lessons  of  the  past  have  led  her  to  offer  unconditional  support  for  the  Hebron  settlers.  There  will  only  be  peace,  she  said,  when  the  Arabs  achieve  their  goal  of  erasing  Israel  from  the  map.  Politics  in  this  world  view  is  a  zero-sum  game.  The  world  is  Auschwitz,  writ  large,  and  the  Jew  ish  State  is  an  embattled  shtetl  that  has  to  make  the  fateful  choice:  to  either  die  behind  the  doors,  or  stand  in  front  of  them  and  use  any  means  to  ensure  its  survival.   I  cannot  help  but  recognise,  in  the   ideology  and  actions  of  the  settlers,  a   distinct  relationship   with  our  persecutors  in  their  old  and  present  guises.   History  has  also  scarred  me,  but  in  a  different  way.  While  I  know  that  the  circumstances  in  this  century  are  different,  I  cannot  help  but  recognise,  in  the  ideology  and  actions  of  the  settlers,  a  distinct  rela  tionship  with  our  persecutors  in  their  old  and  present  guises.   The  distant  mirror  -  which  frames  my  view  of  the  future  -  is  repulsed  by  the  settlers,  who  lean  on   the  conflict  to  rationalise  the  racism   and  culture  of  their  synagogues  and  holy  streets.   It  compels  me  to  reject  the  nationalist  fervour  of  those  who  worship  the  land  and  their  identi  ties,  above  others.  It  recognises  the  need  for  security  walls,  yet  fears   what  these  walls  conceal  on  the  other  side.   But  I  also  recognise  an  image  of  the  entire  Jewish  collective  that  would  prefer  to  regard  these  extremist  youths  as  stray  weeds,  rather  than  products  of  the  garden   we  have  all  tended.   Avraham  Burg  in  his  new  and  controversial  book,  The  Holocaust  is  Over,  has  called  for  the  demons  of  the  past  to  be  exorcised.  But  they  cannot  because  the  past  shapes  who   we  are.   The  real  choice  is  what  to  do  when  we  awaken  each  morning  from  our  dreams  or  nightmares  and   remember.

"  When  the  grapevine  gets  things  wrong   A  hoax  email  suggesting  that   the  United  Kingdom  would  ban  Holocaust  education  for  fear  of  offending  its  Muslim   population  tells  us  much  about  today's  communication   methods,  as  it  does  about  the  state  of  affairs  in  the  ‘mother  country'.   II  know:  things  are  so  bad   you  could  almost  believe  it.  And,  yes,  many  people  pass  emails  around  without  a  moment's   rational  thought  about  their  damaging   consequences.   r   \   KALEIDOSCOPE   JULIE  SZEGO   N  cyberspace,  urban  legends  die  a  slow,  incremental  death  -  if  they  die  at  all.  About  a  year  ago,  an  alarming  chain  email  began  to   spread  like  wildfire,  reaching  a  great  many  people  the  world  over.  One  ver  sion  of  the  message,  headed  “In  Memoriam”,  informed  readers  that:  “Recently  this  week,  UK  removed  the  Holocaust  from  its  school  curriculum  because  it  ‘offended’  the  Moslem  (sic)  population  which  claims  it  never  occurred.  This  is  a  frightening  portent  of  the  fear  that  is  gripping  the  world  and  how  easily  each  country  is  giving   in  to  it.”   Some  variants  of  the  email  report  edly  attributed  the  teaching  ban  to  the  University  of  Kentucky,  presumably  owing  to  confusion  over  the  term  “UK”,  but  the  dominant  version  fin  gered  the  UK  Government  for  this  craven  and  immoral  act.  The  email  was  mindlessly  propagated  via  social  networking  sites  and  countless  blogs.  I  imagine  it  reached  a  significant  num  ber  of  AJN  readers  too,  because  last  week  the  paper  published  a  heartfelt  letter  to  the  editor  from  a  Melbourne  man  expressing  his  disgust  with  the  British  Government.   The  email  was  a  grand  hoax;  whether  it  was  conceived  with  mali  cious  intent  is  unclear.  But  its  effect  had  been  powerful  enough  to  last  month  prompt  the  UK  Government   to  take  the  unprecedented  step  of  writing  to  every  embassy  to  “put  an  end  once  and  for  all  to  the  myth”.  Teaching  the  Holocaust  remains  “non-negotiable”  in  England,  said  Schools  Secretary  Ed  Balls;  it  is  com  pulsory  learning  for  students  aged   between  11  and  14.   My  intention  is  not  to  berate  or  offend  the  letter  writer  who  fell  for  the  hoax;  he  obviously  wasn’t  the  only  one.  Perhaps  the  paper’s  editors  were  clearly  (tellingly?)  asleep  at  the  wheel   on  this  occasion.   You  could  say  the  hoax’s  success  is  a  worrying  portent  of  the  fear  that  is  gripping  the  world  -  a  fear  magnified  in  Jewish  communities.  And  it’s  prob  ably  time  to  get  a  grip.   I  suspect  even  the  most  optimistic  among  us  would  agree  that  political  trends  in  Britain  suggest  a  gathering  darkness:  the  persistent  campaigns  of   unions  from  academics  to  architects   for  a  boycott  of  Israel,  the  particularly  vicious  demonising  of  Israel  from  the  hard  left,  including  London  Mayor  “Red  Kien”,  the  strength  of  political  Islam,  the  frank  anti-Semitism  detected  among  large  numbers  of  Muslim  youth  and  Muslim  commu  nity  leaders.   In  fact,  the  hoax  was  believed  to  have  been  inspired  by  a  deeply  worry  ing  April  2007  report  from  England’s   Historical  Association.  It  found  some   evidence  of  teachers  avoiding  the  sub  ject  of  the  Holocaust  for  fear  of  con  fronting  anti-Semitic  sentiment  and  Holocaust  denial  among  some  Mus  lim  students.  “In  particular  settings,”  the  report  found,  “teachers  of  history  are  unwilling  to  challenge  highly  con  tentious  or  charged  versions  of  history   The  hoax  email  was  mindlessly  propagated  via  social  networking  sites  and  countless  blogs.   in  which  pupils  are  steeped  at  home,  in  their  community  or  in  a  place  of  worship”   But  to  go  from  intimidated  history  teachers  to  a  legislative  ban  is  an  enor  mous  leap  in  credulity.  The  allegation  went  beyond  the  UK  Government  deciding  that  it  would  no  longer  be  compulsory  for  the  Holocaust  to  be  taught  in  schools  (a  development  that  would  have  been  disturbing  enough)  but  that  it  was  so  keen  to  appease  Muslims  it  opted  for  nothing  less  than   a  blanket  ban.   Imagine:  plucky  little  Britain  that  fought  them  single-handedly  on  the  beaches,  retained  its  almost  comic  sto  icism  during  the  Blitz,  vowed  to  never  surrender  and  never  did,  is  now  so  cowed  by  the  terror  threat  it  happily  condemns  the  coming  generations  to  ignorance  about  Hitler’s  singular  crimes  against  humanity.  And,  imag  ine,  not  one  MP  spoke  out  in  anger;  no  thunderous  debate  on  the  floor  of   the  Commons!  Not  one  political  leader  or  cultural  identity  reflected  on  the  dusty  old  medals  in  their  family  chest  and  summoned  enough  courage  to  say:  “This  is  not  what  we  fought  for!”  So  quietly  did  the  vote  pass  even  the  Israeli  Foreign  Ministry  missed  it.   I  know:  things  are  so  bad  you  could  almost  believe  it.  And,  yes,  many  peo  ple  pass  emails  around  without  a  moment’s  rational  thought  about  their  damaging  consequences.  Para  noia,  after  all,  is  often  stoked  by  com  placency.  It  happens  with  chilling  regularity  in  the  Arab  and  Islamic  world,  where  anti-Semitic  conspiracy  theories  have  become  hard  currency.   It’s  worth  noting  that  we’re  not  entirely  immune  from  this  disease.  Let’s  hope  the  “UK”  email  hoax  will  be  the  vaccine  that  prevents  a  future   outbreak.

Our  objective  is  to  develop  an  ongoing  program,  which  utilises  sport  to  build  bridges  between  different  communities  here  in  NSW”   The  first-time  clinic  certainly  proved  a  big  hit  with  the  kids.   “I’d  like  to  do  this  again  because  I’m  with  my  friends  and  it’s  nice  to  meet  people  from  other  schools,”  said  Qibla  Primary  School  student  Natheer  Raffle,  11.   Mount  Sinai  student  Jake  Green,  9,  added,  “It’s  impossible  to  get  bored  of  this  kind  of  fun.”   The  players  also  appeared  to  revel  in  the  attention.  “It’s  inspirational,”  Peace  Team  assistant  coach  and   player  Danny  Brill  told  The  AJN.  “It  makes  me  unbelievably  proud  to  see  kids  from  all  denominations  coming  together  to  play.

"  Moderates  emerging  in  Islamic  world   PETER  KOHN   MODERATES  are  making  their  voices  heard  in  the  Muslim  world,  according  to  a  visiting  United  States-based  terrorism   researcher.   Addressing  a  media  forum  at  the  Aus  tralia-lsrael  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  (AUAC)  in  Melbourne  last  Friday,  Nir  Boms  said  moderates  were  staging  “a  counter-reac  tion  in  the  Muslim  world,  both  inside  and  outside  of  the  Middle  East”,  and  using  tel  evision  as  their  key  communications  tool.   He  said  they  were  striking  back  at  al  Qaeda  and  other  extremist  groups,  and  that  their  use  of  the  internet  and  other  communications  had  given  them  a  power  unimaginable  in  earlier  decades.  He  quoted  David  Kilcullen,  a  US  counter  insurgency  expert,  who  famously  said:  “If   Osama  Bin  Laden  didn’t  have  access  to  global  media,  satellite  communications   and  the  internet,  he  would  just  be  a  cranky  guy  in  a  cave.”   Boms  gave  examples  of  moderates  speaking  out,  including  Sa'ad  Edin  Ibrahim,  an  Egyptian  commentator  who,  he  said,  was  seen  on  Egyptian  TV  stating  that  Israel  had  become  a  technology  powerhouse  with  a  strong  economy  because  it  was  a  democracy.   Ali  Ahmed  Said,  a  voice  in  Syrian  affairs,  has  publicly  targeted  radical  inter  pretations  of  Islam  and  also  campaigned  against  corruption.   Meanwhile,  Bahraini  women's  rights  activist  Ghada  Jamshir  has  slammed  her  society  on  Bahraini  TV  for  tolerating  child  rape,  Sahir  Khabib  has  taken  a  strong  stand  against  Hezbollah  on  Lebanese  TV,  and  Ali  Alyami,  a  Saudi  opposition  activist  based  in   Washington,  has  appeared  on  CNN.   Boms  cited  Wafa  Sultan,  a  Sunni  Muslim  living  in  California,  who  is  a  fierce  critic  of  Islamic  radicalism  and  has  chal   lenged  her  own  religion  in  numerous  forums,  including  an  appearance  on  A!  Jazeera  TV  and  during  a  visit  to  Australia  last  year.   ""Some  of  these  comments  have  had  favourable  results  in  terms  of  changing  things,""  Boms  told  the  AUAC  forum.   Asked  whether  he  could  predict  if  Islam  was  likely  to  experience  the  equiva  lent  of  the  European  Enlightenment,  which  ushered  in  new  approaches  to  Jewish  the  ology  and  transformed  18th-century  Christianity,  Boms  told  The  AJN  any  such  phenomenon  was  more  likely  to  occur  in  ""the  Islamic  diaspora"",  mainly  Africa  and  Asia,  than  in  the  Arab  Middle  East   Boms  is  a  board  member  of  the  Centre  for  Monitoring  the  Impact  of  Peace  and  is  vice-president  of  the  Centre  for  Freedom  in  the  Middle  East  and  a  research  fellow  at  the  International  Insti  tute  for  Counter-Terrorism.

"  Youth  interfaith  encounters   A/W  STAFF   .MUSLIM,  Jewish  and  Christian  teenagers  explored  a  range  of  mutual-interest  issues  on  Sunday  at  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  (NSW  JBD)  Youth  Encounters  program.   Initiated  five  years  ago,  the  pro  gram  brings  300  students  from  the  three  major  frith  groups  together  annually.  The  NSW  JBD’s  Muslim  partner  in  the  program  is  the  Affinity  Intercultural  Foundation,  while  Kincoppal  College  Rose  Bay  is  its  Christian  partner.   On  Sunday,  70  students  from  Sule  College  (Muslim),  Kincoppal  College  (Christian),  Moriah  Col  lege  and  Emanuel  School  partici  pated  in  one  of  the  program’s  events  at  Moriah.  They  discussed  the  faith  challenges  facing  teenagers  in  modern-day  Aus   tralia,  the  challenges  facing  their  particular  communities,  personal  religious  practice,  their  religion’s  key  texts,  and  the  value  of  inter  faith  dialogue.   They  also  played  sport  with  facilitators  from  AusSport  and  enjoyed  a  falafel  lunch.   While  the  student  activities   were  underway,  the  Muslim,  Jewish  and  Christian  teachers  engaged  in  parallel  discussions.   NSW  JBD  CEO  Vic  Alhadeff  said:  “The  value  of  this  program  cannot  be  over-emphasised.

"  hosts   MARC  PERELMAN   MADRID  -  Despite  reservations  of  con  servative  Jewish  and  Muslim  quarters,  and  controversies  over  the  guest  list,  an  unprecedented  interfaith  conference  con  vened  by  Saudi  Arabia  was  attended  by  nearly  300  representatives  from  the  world's  major  faiths  in  Madrid  this  past   week.   The  meeting,  which  was  hastily  organ  ised  in  recent  weeks,  featured  calls  for  peaceful  coexistence,  and  steered  clear  of  sensitive  political  issues,  such  as  Iraq,  Iran  and  the  Palestinians.  For  many  of  those  in  attendance,  the  primary  impor  tance  of  the  conference  was  the  fact  that  it  was  taking  place  at  all.   “I  would  just  use  the  old  Woody  Allen   adage:  90  per  cent  of  life  is  just  showing  up,”  said  Rabbi  David  Rosen,  director  of  inter-religious  affairs  at  the  American  Jewish  Committee.  “This  is  a  historic  event  just  by  the  very  fact  that  it  is  taking  place.”   The  run-up  to  the  conference  was  marked  by  a  series  of  disputes.  One  involved  Rabbi  Rosen,  who  is  based  in  Jerusalem  and  holds  dual  Israeli  and  Irish  citizenship.   After  the  Associated  Press  reported  that  he  was  the  only  Israeli  invited,  the  Saudi  organisers,  who  had  purposefully  not  invited  Israelis  or  Palestinians,  scram  bled  for  a  few  days  before  deciding  to  list  him  as  American  in  the  conference  litera  ture.  This  prompted  a  barbed  reaction   from  Israel.   “Practically  speaking,  he  is  being  invited  as  a  foreigner  and  not  as  an  Israeli,”  said  Arye  Mekel,  an  Israeli  Foreign  Ministry  spokesman.  ""If  they  really  wanted  to  make  this  significant,  they  should  have  invited  real  Israeli  rabbis.”   Rabbi  Rosen  stressed  that  the  organ  isers  had  never  intended  to  invite  him  as  an  Israeli,  and  commended  them  for  finding  a  way  to  keep  him  on  the  list   “When  I  went  to  salute  King  Abdullah,  I  made  a  point  of  identifying  myself  as  a  rabbi  from  Jerusalem,  and  although  some  people  in  his  entourage  gasped,  he  warmly  greeted  me,”  Rabbi  Rosen  said.   Critics  of  the  conference  pointed  out  that  the  Spanish  venue  was  a  stark  reminder  that  non-Muslims  are  not  authorised  to  practice  their  faith  openly   in  Saudi  Arabia,  thus  casting  doubt  on  the  kingdom’s  real  commitment  to  inter  faith  dialogue.   Another  controversial  issue  was  the  absence  of  women  speakers  at  the  con  ference,  which  was  publicly  mentioned  by  several  participants  as  a  ""serious  problem"",  according  to  Rabbi  Arthur  Waskow  of  the  Shalom  Centre.   But  the  controversies  were,  by  most  accounts,  a  sideshow  at  the  conference.  ""A  Muslim  king  sponsoring  a  meal  hosted  by  a  Catholic  king  at  which  Jews  had  kosher  meal  options,”  marveled  Rabbi  Burton  Visotzky  from  the  Jewish  Theolog  ical  Seminary.

"  West  Bank  settlers  must  be  held  accountable   DAVID  FORfVIAN   JERUSALEM  -  When  Baruch  Gold  stein  massacred  29  Muslim  wor   shipers  in  the  Cave  of  the  Patriarchs  on  Purim  1994,  prime  minister  Yitzhak  Rabin  wanted  to  evacuate   Jewish  settlers  from  their  stronghold  in  Tel  Rumeida  in  the  heart  of   Hebron,  and  from  Kiryat  Arba.  He  was  advised  that  such  a  move  would   prompt  an  outpouring  of  protest  -  perhaps  a  violent  one  -  from  other   settlers.  Rabin  abandoned  the  idea.   The  settlers,  particularly  in  Hebron,  are  seldom  held  accountable  for  their  behaviour.   When  violence  erupts,  not  only  against  Palestinians,  but  also  against  the  army  or  police,  rarely  is  anyone   Photo:  Isranet   A  Jewish  settler  being  carried  sway  by  police  forces  In  Hebron.   arrested.  Indeed,  after  the  Goldstein  massacre,  it  was  the  Palestinians  in  Hebron  and  environs  who  were   placed  under  a  hermetically  sealed  curfew  -  not  the  Jews  in  Tel  Rumeida  or  Kiryat  Arba,  who  praised  Gold  stein  as  a  martyr.   Israeli  lawmakers  on  both  sides  of   the  political  aisle  have  established  the  settlements,  even  though  the  policy  was  contrary  to  international  law,  and  in  many  cases,  to  Israeli  law.  This  meant  that  the  government  con  tributed  to  the  rampant  lawlessness  that  has  dominated  too  many  of  the  Jewish  settlers’  activities.   When,  in  1988,  settler  leader  Moshe  Levinger  served  only  92  days  for  shooting  dead  a  Palestinian  store  owner,  it  became  clear  to  the  settlers  that  the  authorities  would  look  the   other  way  when  they  committed  acts  of  violence  against  Palestinians.   The  chickens  have  now  come  home  to  roost,  and  it  has  become  vir  tually  impossible  to  silence  the  set  tlers’  outrageous  cockiness.  The  time   has  come  for  the  army  and  police  to  stop  complaining  about  the  abuses  of  some  settlers  against  them,  and  con  centrate  on  their  total  disregard  for  the  rule  of  law.  Fear  of  settler  reaction   cannot  deter  the  government  from  reining  them  in.  The  use  of  a  carrot  and-stick  approach  to  curtail  settler  actions  is  no  longer  viable.   It  certainly  is  not  feasible  with  a  population  that  sees  its  mission  to  be  divinely  inspired.  When  the  high  level  of  leniency  on  the  part  of  every  gov  ernment  for  their  aggressive  behav  iour  is  added  to  this,  why  should  anyone  be  shocked  when  they  attack  not  only  Arabs,  but  also  Jews  -  be  they  soldiers,  police  or  Professor  Ze’ev  Stemhell  -  or  even  assassinate  a  prime  minister?

"  Pakistan,  post-Musharraf   URIEL  HELLMAN   NEW  YORK—With  control  of  the  world’s   only  nuclear-armed  Muslim  state  up  in  die  air,  many  Jewish  and  Israeli  observers  are  watching  die  political   turmoil  in  Pakistan  with  unease.   Pervez  Musharraf,  who  resigned  as  Pakistan’s  president  last  week,  may  not  have  been  a  great  friend  of  the  Jewish  people,  but  he  was  seen  as  an  ally  of  the  West  and  a  relatively  mod   erate  leader  of  a  nuclear  state  with  powerful  Islamist  elements.   He  also  had  some  ties  to  Jewish  groups.  In  2005,  Musharraf  addressed  a  Jewish  gathering  in  New  York,   where  he  said  Pakistan  would  estab  lish  ties  with  Israel  after  the  Pales  tinians  have  a  state.  During  that  same  visit,  Musharraf  shook  hands  with  then  Israeli  prime  minister  Ariel  Sharon  at  the  UN  General  Assembly.   With  Musharraf  out,  it’s  not  dear  whether  or  not  the  open  door  that  Jewish  organisational  leaders  have  had  in  Islamabad  is  in  danger  of  slamming  shut   “It’s  a  big  plus  for  the  Jewish  people  to  have  an  opening  to  the  world’s  only  nudear-armed  Muslim  country,”  David  Twersky,  senior  adviser  for  international  affairs  at  the  American  Jewish  Congress  (AJC),  said  of  the  relationship  between  American  Jewish  groups  and  Musharraf.  “I  hope  the  idea  of  being   Former  Pakistani  president  Pervez  Musharraf  (left)  addresses  a  2005  gathering  of  the  Council  for  World  Jewry  In  New  York,  with  Jack  Rosen,  chairman  of  the  American  Jewish  Congress.

That  doesn’t  falter  with  Musharraf  leaving.”   Musharraf’s  tenure  saw  the  first   high-level  diplomatic  contacts  between  Israel  and  Pakistan.  The  countries’  foreign  ministers  met  in  Istanbul  2005,  and  after  Israel’s  with  drawal  from  the  Gaza  Strip  in  Sep  tember  of  that  year,  Musharraf  said  it  was  time  for  Pakistan  to  engage  with   Israel.   Whoever  emerges  as  die  next  pres  ident,  analysts  say  the  new  leader  is  unlikely  to  wield  the  same  broad  ranging  powers  as  Musharraf.   Even  if  a  pro-western  regime  endures  in  Islamabad,  it  isn’t  dear  whether  the  next  leader  will  be  able  to  keep  Pakistan’s  hard-line  Islamists  at   bay.   JTA ",2008-08-29

Such  was  the  bounty  that  there  was  enough  food  left  over  -  pasta,  salad,  falafel,  hummous  and  Anzac  cookies  -  to  distribute  to  those  in  need  through  the  charity,  OzHarvest   Organised  by  the  Australasian  Union  of  Jewish  Students  (AUJS)  and  the  MTO  Sufi  Association  (MTO),  students  later  gathered  in  small  groups  to  discuss   Cooking  for  a  cause...

""A  lot  of  interfaith  events  are  about  politics.  Here,  we're  about  building  friend  ships.  Rather  than  discussing  problems;  we're  coming  together  and  doing  things  that  we  all  share  in  common,’'  said  AUJS  event  coordinator  Leeran  Gold.   “Once  we  break  bread  together,  we  can  become  friends.  Once  we  become  friends,  we  have  a  good  basis  to  start  dis  cussing  the  issues  we  face,""  she  added.   MTO  organiser  Ramak  Salamat  said  that  the  event  highlighted  the  ability  of  both  Muslims  and  Jews  to  “work  towards  unity”.   Opposition  Leader  Malcolm  Turnbull,  who  was  among  those  in  attendance,  called  the  event  a  “wonderful  initiative”.   “There  is  nothing  more  human  than  preparing  food  and  sharing  with  friends,”  he  said.  “[It]  says  a  lot  about  the  two  groups  involved,  as  well  as  saying  a  lot   about  Australians.”   Participant  Neil  Shersaid  he  would  like  to  see  such  cook-ins  become  a  regular  affair.  “Hopefully,  this  will  lead  to  many  more  events  of  this  kind,  building  on  these  newly  formed  relationships,”  he  said.

"  A  group  of  38  travellers  from  around  Australia  experienced  a  taste  of  Jewish  India  on  a  recent  Temple  Beth  Israel  tour.  Peter  Kohn  spoke  to  tour  leader  Rabbi  Fred  Morgan  and  participant  Dot  Nathan  about  their  experiences.   |  RADITIONAL  Muslim  women  in   burkhas  picking  up  their  children   Xfrom  school  might  appear  to  be  a   commonplace  sight  in  India  -  until  you  realise  it’s  a  Jewish  school.   Rabbi  Fred  Morgan,  who  has  just  returned  from  India,  where  he  and  his  wife,  Sue  Morgan,  led  a  group  of  38  people  on  a  tour  of  India’s  major  faiths,  says  the  sight  was  one  of  the  most  memorable  of  the  three-week  tour.   After  three  years  of  planning,  Shalom  India  departed  in  March.  It  was  an  odyssey  that  enabled  the  group,  including  several  people  from  Temple  Beth  Israel  (TBI)  and  other   An  ornate  menoran  at  a  synagogue  in  Aiibag.   groups  in  the  Melbourne  Jewish  com  munity,  as  well  as  from  Sydney,  Auckland  and  the  United  Kingdom,  to  look  at  Indian  traditions  through  Jewish  eyes.   The  tour,  run  by  Tempo  Holidays,  utilised  the  services  of  renowned  250  year-old  Indian  travel  agency  Cox  and  Kings.  It  gave  the  TBI  group  a  first  hand  look  at  the  breathtaking  con  trasts  of  opulence  and  grinding  poverty.  The  group  saw  communal  cohesiveness,  a  relentless  caste  sys  tem  and  religious  tensions.   The  sheer  population  density,  even  in  remote  areas,  left  a  lasting  impact  on  Sue  Morgan,  who  said  she  was  also  taken  aback  when  she  saw  the  gaping  differences  between  the  wealthy  and  the  poor,  and  the  highly  visible  signs  of  poverty  on  the  streets.   For  Rabbi  Morgan  -  who  taught  comparative  religion  at  Bristol  University  in  the  UK  before  studying  for  the  rabbinate  -  it  was  a  chance  to  revisit  familiar  ground  and  expand  his  horizons,  while  sharing  his  knowl  edge  of  the  subcontinent  with  mem  bers  of  the  tour.   “Our  aim  was  to  focus  on  Judaism’s  Indian  context,  even  though  Jews  are  numerically  such  a  small  proportion  of  Indian  society,”  he  says.  (There  are  around  5000  Jews  in  India,  among  a  general  population  of  more  than  1.1  billion).   The  attitude  of  Indians  to  the  visit  ing  group  ranged  from  curiosity  about  Australia  -  including  a  good  humoured  approach  to  the  abrasive   recent  test  cricket  series  -  to  ques  tions  about  Judaism.   Hotel  staff  “leaning  over  back  wards”  to  help  the  group  organise  its  kabbalat  Shabbat  -  complete  with  eastern  meditations  -  was  an  abiding   memory.   At  Varanasi,  a  great  centre  of  Hinduism,  India’s  predominant   ,  ,Qur  aim  was  to  focus   on’Judaism’s  Indian  context,  even  though  Jews  are  numerically   such  a  small  proportion  of  Indian  society.   Rabbi  Fred  Morgan  Shalom  India  tour  leader   religion,  the  group  watched  hundreds  participating  in  ritual  bathing  on  the  ghats  (steps)  leading  down  to  the  River  Ganges,  and  the  conversation  among  the  visitors  was  filled  with  inevitable  comparisons  to  mikvahs.   “Both  are  a  preparation  for  a  reli  gious  encounter,  but  unlike  the  mik  vah,  ritual  bathing  in  Hinduism  is  believed  to  bring  a  magical  sense  of  change,”  Rabbi  Morgan  explains.   At  the  Taj  Mahal  in  Agra  and  the  Jama  Masjid  (Great  Mosque)  in  Delhi,   he  remembers  Jewish  visitors  admir  ing  “the  sense  of  architecture  in  Islam”,  whose  tradition,  like  Judaism,  shuns  icons  and  images.  By  contrast,  Hinduism  celebrates  its  330  million  gods  with  brightly  coloured  tributes  and  garish  designs.   In  the  northern  Indian  Punjab,  the  Australian  group  visited  the  Golden  Temple  at  Amritsar,  the  spiritual  home  of  the  Sikhs,  whose  monotheis  tic  tradition  shuns  iconology,  as  does  Islam.  But  like  Hindus,  the  Sikhs  believe  in  rebirth.   “Like  Jews,  Sikhs  have  a  great  sense  of  communal  responsibility.  We  saw  one  of  the  Sikh  soup  kitchens,  which  serve  thousands  every  day,”  explains  Dot  Nathan,  who  was  on  the  tour  with  her  husband,  Paul.   The  group  held  Shabbat  services  and  shiurim  in  Amritsar,  and  also  in  Jaipur  -  which  Rabbi  Morgan  believes  may  have  been  a  first  in  Indian  history.   At  Mount  Abu  in  Rajasthan,  after  a  six-hour  drive  into  a  mountainous  region  of  India’s  south,  the  visitors  saw  the  white  marble  temples  of  the  Jains,  an  ascetic  sect  that  commenced  in  India  2500  years  ago.   A  tenet  of  Jainism  is  to  achieve  peace  by  not  acting;  by  remaining  neu  tral  to  the  rigours  and  challenges  of  life  -  a  philosophy  that  runs  counter  to  Judaism,  Rabbi  Morgan  said.   The  group  visited  Aurangabad  and  the  painted  caves  of  Ajanta,  a  Buddhist  site.  Buddhism  -  “a  spiritual  response  to  ancient  Hinduism”,  Rabbi  Morgan  explains  -  was  a  frequent   A  street  sign  in  Cochin  reflects  the  city’s  proud  Jewish  heritage.   topic  of  conversation  for  the  Shalom  India  travellers.  Some  Jews  have  an  affinity  for  Buddhism’s  devotion  to  cultivating  serenity,  and  this  may  explain  the  phenomenon  of  the  Bu-Jews,  Jewish  westerners  who  have  immersed  themselves  in  Buddhism,  says  Rabbi  Morgki.   The  tour  also  took  in  the  holy  sites  of  the  Parsees  (Zoroastrians),  a  community  that  has  given  India  some  of  its  greatest  industri  alists  and  nation-builders.  Zubin  Mehta,  the  Indian-born  conductor  known  for  his  long   association  with  the  Israel  Philharmonic  Orchestra,  is  a  Parsee.   “Zoroastrian  dualism,  a  view  that  the  world  is  made  up  of  stark  choices  between  light  and  dark  forces,  is  not  shared  by  Judaism,”  said  Rabbi  Morgan.  “In  fact,  Judaism  in  ancient  Persia,  from  where  the  Zoroastrians  came,  actually  grew  and  strengthened  through  its  reaction  against  this  light-dark  view  of  the  world.”   In  Mumbai,  Nathan  was  struck  by  the  urbanity  and  the  western  influence  of  the  city  that  brought  the  world  Bollywood.  “It’s  where  you  find  the  rising  middle  class.  It’s  the  city  that  westerners  perhaps  feel  more  at  home  in  than  any  other  place  in  India.”   RODEF  Shalom,  a  Progressive  syna   gogue,  is  one  of  several  congregations  in  Mumbai,  where  around  3000  -  or  three-fifths  -  of  India’s  Jews  live.   The  synagogue  welcomed  their  Australian  Progressive  counterparts  for  a  kabbalat  Shabbat  service,  with  a  mix  of  the  familiar  and  the  exotic.  “The  melodies  are  very  much  like  our  own,  but  the  prayers  are  printed  in  a  transliteration  into  Marathi,  a  local  dialect  that  uses  Sanskritic  letters,”  said  Rabbi  Morgan.   Rodef  Shalom  was  formed  in  the  1970s,  but  has  been  without  its  own  place  of  wor  ship  since  the  early  1990s,  when  rioting  between  Hindus  and  Muslims  destroyed  the  building.  The  congregation  now  meets  in  an  ORT  centre,  established  by  visiting  Progressive  Rabbi  Hugo  Gryn.   “We  were  fascinated  by  their  Shabbat  bra  chot,”  says  Nathan.  “First  there  is  ha’gafen  [wine],  but  then  they  make  two  other  brachot  -  ha’aitz  [for  trees],  then  ha’adamah,  which  we  make  at  the  seder  [for  fruits  of  the  earth],  after  which  they  eat  dates  and  bananas.  At  the  very  end,  they  make  ha’motzi  [the  brachah  for  bread].”   The  visitors  were  intrigued  by  the  congre  gation’s  Indian  social  customs.  “First,  we   Inside  the  Magen  David  Synagogue  in  Mumbai.   talked,  then  we  ate  very  late,  and  after  the  meal  we  promptly  said  our  farewells.  Unlike  what  we’re  used  to,  it  was  extremely  ordered.”   Mumbai  is  the  location  of  the  Jewish  City  School,  founded  by  philanthropist  David  Sassoon.  The  school  relies  on  non-Jews  to  make  up  its  numbers,  and  welcomes  families  of  all  faiths.  It  is  here,  the  visitors  saw  tradi  tional  Islamic  women  collecting  their  children   after  school.   With  the  foundation  of   Israel  in  1948,  many  of   the  Bene  Israel  made  aliyah,  while  others   migrated  to  Mumbai   and  now  follow  the  \   Sephardi  tradition.   40^   “If  only  we  could  have  that  kind  of  harmony  here,”  said  Nathan.   Another  highlight  was  Alibag,  on  the  Konkan  coast  south  of  Mumbai,  where  the  group  visited  the  site  of  a  shipwreck  -  one  of  the  ships  that  brought  seven  families  of  Judean  traders  to  India  more  than  2000  years  ago  at  the  time  of  the  Second  Temple.   The  community  they  established  became   known  as  the  Bene  Israel  and  has  survived  to  this  day.  Rabbi  Morgan  recounted  the  inter  vention  of  the  British  colonisers  who  brought  in  European  rabbis  to  test  the  Bnei  Israel’s  claimed  Jewish  lineage,  at  a  time  when  it  was  still  a  very  distinct  group.   “The  rabbis  found  the  Bene  Israel  didn’t  relate  to  any  of  the  customs  or  the  chagim,  as  they’d  left  Judea  in  pre-rabbinic  times,  but  they  could  recite  the  Shema  perfectly.”   With  the  foundation  of  Israel  in  1948,  many  of  the  Bene  Israel  made  aliyah,  while  others  migrated  to  Mumbai  and  now  follow  the  Sephardi  tradition.   A  plaque  listing  benefactors  to  the  ship   wreck  memorial  includes  former  Australian  Jewish  community  stalwart  Isi  Leibler,  now  living  in  Israel.  Leibler  was  awarded  the  Gandhi  Prize  for  strengthening  relations   between  Israel  and  India.   At  Cochin,  the  tour  took  in  the  Pardesi  -  the  oldest  synagogue  in  India  -  located  on  Jewtown  Road,  a  name  that  rings  oddly  in  western  ears.  When  they  discovered  that  the  person  memorialised  on  the  parochet  (ark  curtain)  was  soon  to  have  her  yahrzeit,  they  recited  Kaddish  for  her  in  the  synagogue.   At  the  Pardesi,  visitors  are  required  to  remove  their  shoes,  a  decidedly  “un-Jewish”  custom,  but  very  prevalent  throughout  India.  In  this  case,  it  had  a  practical  purpose  -  to  preserve  magnificent  Chinese  tiles  that  were  donated  to  the  community.   “There  are  seven  Jews  in  Cochin,  and  one  is  an  80-year-old  woman,”  said  Nathan.  “They  look  very  European,  as  there  has  been  virtu   ally  no  intermarriage  with  local  people.”   The  Shalom  India  explorers  returned  home  in  time  for  Purim,  which  TBI  celebrated  with  a  welcome-home  communal  Shabbat  dinner  on  a  Bollywood  theme,  complete  with   curries.   Two  “debriefing  sessions”  will  be  held  at  TBI  in  August,  at  which  the  travellers  will  share  their  experiences  with  other  members  of  the  synagogue  and  the  broader  Jewish  community.

"  Giving  the  most   BEYOND   CHUTZPAH   MICHAEL  V1S0OTAY   The  best  gifts  are  those  that  encourage  learning  and   tolerance.   JUKAH  approaches   it’s  time  to  think  about  With  an  altruistic  yar  ce  on,  here  is  a  list  of  gifts  that  may  do  some  good  for  children,  as  well  as  keep  them  occupied.   The  starting  point  is  the  online  multiplayer  game  Eagle  Rising  -  Gaza,  a  shoot-’em-up  warfare  game  developed  by  an  Israeli  software  designer  and  bankrolled  by  a  Syd  ney  businessman.   There  has  been  a  backlash   against  Eagle  Rising  by  Jewish  com  munity  groups  for  its  inflammatory  aim  because  it  pits  the  Iranian  Rev  olutionary  Guard  against  Israel’s  elite  Golani  Brigade  in  a  first-person  shooter  setting,  with  the  Israeli  force  designed  as  the  superior  power.   In  part,  this  backlash  was  fuelled  by  the  release  of  another  computer  game,  Muslim  Massacre,  which   deserved  condemnation  for  its  dis  tasteful  aim  of  encouraging  players  to  shoot  as  many  Muslims  as  possible.   At  least  Eagle  Rising  allows  play  ers  to  put  themselves  in  the  place  of  the  enemy  and  develop  empathy  for  them.  The  game’s  financial  backer,  Kevin  Bermeister,  said  in  defence,  “People  will  get  to  know  each  other  in  a  competitive  battleground  envi  ronment,  get  to  text  each  other,  speak  to  each  other,  connect  with  each  other,  and  figure  out  that  they’re  human  beings  and  they  can  get  along  with  each  other.”   Perhaps,  although  anyone  who  has  played  computer  games  will  assume  that  kids  are  probably  going  to  ignore  this  potential  and  simply   default  to  lowest  common  denomi  nator:  blast  and  demonise  the  enemy  -  whichever  side  you  happen   to  be  on.   But  in  the  real  world,  this  role  swapping  culture  could  be  broad  ened  into  a  range  of  safe  experiences  that  would  make  educational  gifts,   which  last  for  life.   For  starters,  what  if  young  Jewish  women,  instead  of  being  bought  a  new  dress  for  Chanukah,  were  given  a  Muslim  chador  to  walk  around  in.  A  week,  or  even  a  day,  of  the  stares  and  whispers  that  are  directed  at   Muslim  women  -  not  to  mention   the  physical  sensation  of  being  hid  den,  and  unable  to  express  them  selves  through  their  physical  appearance  -  would  make  for  a  powerful  gift  Especially  in  summer,  when  it’s  hot  and  sticky,  and  the  streets  of  Bondi  and  St  Kilda  are  packed  with  sun  worshippers.   In  the  same  spirit,  young  Jewish  men  could  be  given  the  white  cotton  loose-fitting  shirt  and  pants  that  many  Muslim  men  wear,  along  with  the  white  cotton  skullcap,  similar  in  a  shape  to  a  Sephardi  yarmulke.  They  wouldn’t  have  to  grow  a  beard.   A  couple  of  days  walking  around  the  city  in  this  garb  would  also  give  them  an  insight  into  what  it  feels  like  to  be  identified  as  a  Muslim,  and  all  the  preconceptions  they  then  read  into  other  people’s  interaction   with  them.   If  this  gift  program  were  gen  uine,  it  would  be  accompanied  by  a  mirror  group  of  young  people  within  the  Muslim  community,  male  and  female,  who  would  wear  a  Magen  David  around  their  necks  for  a  similar  period  of  time,  as  they  go  about  their  daily  life.

The  older  you  get,  the  more  courage  it  takes  to  act  beyond  the  values  of  your  peer  group.   If  our  children,  the  citizens  and  leaders  of  our  next  generation,  are  given  this  opportunity,  then  we  would  be  giving  them  the  most  valuable  gift  of  all:  the  cultural  tools  to  look  beyond  reflex  fear  and  prejudice.

"  DUBAI  OR  NOT  DUBAI   I  AGREE  with  Vic  Alhadeff  (AJN  25/01).  I  am  disappointed  that  the  remainder  of  the  community  identi-  ties  and  others  questioned  on  visiting  Dubai  did  not  wholeheartedly  share   Mr  Alhadeff’s  stance  that  one  should  not  go.  As  far  as  I  am  concerned  the  UAE  can  keep  its  tennis  tournament;  in  the  absence  of  the  pressure  exerted  by  the  Women’s  Tennis  Association,  Tzipi  Obziler  would  not  be  allowed  to  compete  in  the  Dubai  Tennis  Championship,  for  the  sole  reason  that  she  is  an  Israeli  (read:  Jew).   In  addition  to  failing  to  recognise  Israel  and  its  right  to  exist,  Muslim  countries  steadfastly  boycott  Israel,  Israeli  products  and  even,  in  the  case  of  Muslim  countries  devastated  by  the  tsunami  of  some  years  ago,  rejected  Israeli  humanitarian  aid  relief  and  assistance.  It’s  high  time  we  invoked  some  boycotting  of  our  own:  Muslim  countries,  airlines,  products  —  who  needs  or  wants  them?  Not  me.   GEORGE  BOGNAR   Rose  Bay,  NSW ",2008-02-01
"  ISRAEL/WORLD  JEWRY  DIVIDE   I  FIND  it  perplexing  that  according  to  a  new  study,  most  American  Jews  don’t  think  Israel  should  remain  a  homeland  for  the  Jews  (A/N  11/01).   I  have  yet  to  hear  of  any  similar  studies  conducted  concerning  Mus-  lims  worldwide  calling  for  any  of  the  57  Islamic  states  to  no  longer  exist  as  Muslim  countries.  What  is  it  about  Jews  that  they  feel  they  must  succumb  to  pressure  from  the  hypercritical  western  pro-Arab/Muslim  support-   ers,  or  is  it  many  Jews  no  longer  have  the  stomach  to  defend  their  rights  to   have  a  Jewish  homeland?   It  is  obvious  that  American  and  other  Jews  who  don’t  believe  it  is  neces-  sary  for  Jews  to  have  their  own  home-  land  have  short  memories  and  would  prefer  the  existing  Jewish  community   in  Israel  to  live  under  what  would  eventually  be  majority  Arab/Muslim  rule.

"  SAME  OL’  SAME  OL’   IN  the  lead-up  to  the  US  elections,  many  columnists  expounded  on  how  much  of  the  international  community,  including  the  Middle  East,  was  anxious  for  a  Democratic  win.  Ayaan  Hirsi  Ali,  raised  as  a  Somali  Muslim,  injected  a  note  of  sobriety  in  The  Australian  (04/11)  when  she  observed  that  Barack  Obama  considered  Afghanistan  a  legitimate  front  in  the  “war  on  terror”,  and  would  send  more  troops  there.  “In  short  order,  this  ...  would  end  Obama’s  honeymoon.  It  would  remind  the  Islamists  and  their  sympathisers  across  the  Muslim  world  that  Obama  would  not  act  out  of  soli  darity  with  people  based  on  the  colour  of  his  skin  or  because  of  his  origins  in  Kenya,  but  as  the  commander-in-chief  protecting  US  national  interests  above   all.”   She  also  suggested  that  when  Obama’s  promised  talks  with  Iran  failed  to  convince  the  regime  to  drop  its  nuclear  program,  he  may  be  forced  to  act,  destroying  a  perception  in  the  Muslim  world  that  US  foreign  policy  would  fundamentally  change  with  Obama’s  inauguration  in  January.

"  World  still  asleep  after  Mumbai  terror  attacks   ANALYSIS   DANIEL  PIPES   STANFORD  -  Victims  caught  in  terrorist  atrocities  perpetrated  for  Islam  typically  experience  fear,  torture,  horror  and  murder,  with  sirens  screaming,  snipers  positioning  and  carnage  in  the  streets.  That  was  the  case  recently  in  Mumbai.  But  for  the  real  target  of  Islamist  terror  -  the  world  at  large  -  the  experience  has  become  numbed,  with  apologetics  and  justification  muting  repulsion   and  shock.   If  terrorism  ranks  among  the  crudest  and  most  inhumane  forms  of  warfare,  Islamist  terrorism  has  also  become  well-rehearsed  political   theatre.   As  one  reflects  on  the  most   publicised  episodes  of  Islamist  terror  against  westerners  since  9/11  -  the  attack  on  Australians  in  Bali,  on  Spaniards  in  Madrid,  on  Russians  in  Beslan,  on  Britons  in  London  -  a  twofold  pattern  emerges:  Muslim   exultation  and  western  denial.  The   same  tragedy  replays  itself,  with  only  names  changed.   Muslim  exaltation:  The  Mumbai   assault  inspired  occasional  condemnations,  hushed  official  regrets  and  cornucopias  of  unofficial  enthusiasm.  The  Iranian  and  Syrian  governments  exploited  the  event  to  assail  the  United  States,  Israel  and  the  Zionist  movement,  and  to  represent  them  as  responsible  for  terrorism  in  India  and  the  world  in  general.  Al-Jazeera’s  website  overflowed  with  comments  such  as  “Allah,  grant  victory  to  Muslims.  Allah,  grant  vic  tory  to  Jihad“  and  “the  killing  of  a  Jewish  rabbi  and  his  wife  in  the  Jewish  centre  in  Mumbai  is  heartwarming   news”.   Such  supremacism  and  bigotry  can  no  longer  surprise,  given  the  well  documented,  worldwide  acceptance  of  terror  among  many  Muslims.   Western  denial:  The  fact  that  ter   rorist  fish  are  swimming  in  a  hos  pitable  Muslim  sea  nearly  disappears  amid  western  political,  journalistic  and  academic  bleatings.  Call  it  polit  ical  correctness,  multiculturalism  or  self-loathing;  whatever  the  name,  this  mentality  produces  delusion  and  dithering.   If  “terrorist”  is  impolite,  adjectives  such  as  Islamist,  Islamic  and  Muslim  become  unmentionable.   What  will  finally  rouse  westerners  from  their  stupor  -  to  name  the  enemy  and  fight  the  war  to  victory?  Only  one  filing  seems  likely:  massive  deaths,  say  100,000  casualties  in  a  single  attack.  Short  of  that,  it  appears,  much  of  the  West,  contently  deploying  defensive  measures  against  fancifiilly-described  “activists”,  will  gently  slumber  on.

"  Kosovo's  independence   raises  issues  for  Israel   DINAH  SPRITZER   Kosovars  wave  Albanian  and  US  flags  as  they  celebrate  in  Pristina  on  Monday  after  the  US  formally  recognised  Kosovo’s  controversial  Independence.  Photo:  AAP   PRISTINA,  Kosovo  -  Hashim  Thaci  may  be  the  tough-talking  prime   minister  of  Kosovo  and  ex-commander  of  the  Kosovo  Liberation  Army,  but  he  gushes  over  Israel  like  a  kid  recalling  a  trip  to  Disney  World.   “I  love  Israel.  What  a  great  country.  Kosovo  is  a  friend  of  Israel,”  the  grinning  Thaci,  39,  said  while  in  a  Pristina  hotel,  crowned  by  a  miniature  Statue  of  Liberty.  “I  met  so  many  great  leaders  when  I  was  there:  [Binyamin]  Netanyahu,  [Ariel]  Sharon  —  I  really  admire  them,”  Thaci   continued.   With  the  province  of  Kosovo  declaring  independence  from  Serbia  on  Sunday  following  years  of  failed  negotiations  with  the  Serbs,  Thaci  is  now  the  prime  minister  of  Europe’s  newest  country.     Kosovo  is  home  to  some  2.2  million   people,  90  per  cent  of  whom  are  ethnic  Albanians  with  Muslim  roots.    Despite  Kosovo  having  the  most   pro-American  vibe  in  Europe  and  a  profoundly  secular  stance  on  Islam,  as  well  as  Thaci’s  supportive  line  on  Israel,  some  Israeli  analysts  say  recog-  nising  its  independence  from  Serbia  is  not  in  Israel’s  interest.  They  argue  that  recognition  sets  a  precedent  for  foreign  interference  in  bilateral  dis-  putes  that  could  affect  negotiations  between  Israel  and  the  Palestinians.     There  is  also  general  concern   among  Israeli  officials  over  encour-  aging  Muslim  separatist  movements,  and  that  Kosovo’s  independence  will  help  create  a  new  Muslim  corridor  within  Europe  where  radical  Islam   could  take  root.   Kosovo  experts  say  this  fear  is  misplaced,  as  generally  Kosovo  Mus-  lims  are  secular,  pro-western  and,  in  many  cases,  fond  of  Jews  and  Israel.   Kosovars  tend  to  place  much  more  emphasis  on  their  ethnic  Albanian  identity  than  on  their  Muslim  identity,  which  developed   under  centuries  of  Ottoman  rule.   On  Monday  the  US  was  amongst  the  first  to  recognise  the  new  country,  followed  closely  by  Britian,  France,  and  Germany.  Their  recog-  nition  was  vehemently  opposed  by  Russia,  Serbia’s  key  ally.   For  now,  Israel  is  following  devel-  opments  and  will  form  its  position  in  the  future,  according  to  a  statement  from  the  Foreign  Affairs  Ministry.  Although  reluctant  to  be  among  the  first  to  recognise  Kosovo,  Israel  is  expected  to  follow  the  West  in  recog-  nising  the  new  state.   While  Serbia  cannot  punish  every  country  that  recognises  Kosovo,  Israel  is  concerned  about  jeopar-  dising  its  significant  economic  investments  in  Serbia,  as  well  as  being  wary  of  the  geopolitical  impli-  cations  of  recognising  a  breakaway   province.

"  NA0IW1B  LEVIN   HISTORY  OF  PERTH’S  JEWS  AND  MUSLIMS  HEARD  IN  HARMONY  WEEK   PERTH  -  At  a  recent  reception  in  honour  of  Harmony  Week,  Keith  Shilkin,  president  of  the  Jewish  Community  Council  of  Western  Australia,  outlined  the  historic  closeness  of  the  Muslim  and  Jewish  com  munities  in  his  home  state.   Shilkin  said  that,  from  1829,  when  Jewish  settlers  arrived  in  the  West  to  work  in  the  goldfields,  they  had  contact  with  Muslim  people,  including  Malay  pearl  divers  and  Afghan  camel  drivers.   He  added  that  when  he  was  young,  the  synagogue  in  Perth  had  been  around  the  corner  from  the  city’s  mosque  and  ""there  was  much  mutual  respect  and  complete  harmony  as  we  passed  each  other’s  place  of  worship”.   That  contact  between  the  two  religious  communities  has  continued,  he  explained  to  the  audience,  which  included  many  members  of  the  local  Islamic  community.   ""Our  faith  schools  have  interchange  meetings  and  the  kids  from  the  Carmel  School  really  enjoy,  gain  and  learn  from  the  experience,”  Shilkin  added.

"  CHANTALABITBOL   A  NEW  online  video  game  funded  by  a  Sydney  Jewish  businessman  that  pits  Israeli  troops  against  Iranian  troops  has  sparked  the  ire  of  Jewish  groups,  who  are  calling  the  concept  “unhelp  ful”  and  “inappropriate”.   The  Israeli-designed  multiplayer  game,  Rising  Eagle  -  Gaza,  which  was  released  as  a  free  download  last  week,  pits  the  Iranian  Revolutionary  Guard  against  Israel’s  elite  Golani  Brigade  in  a  first-person  shooter  setting  -  and  includes  photographs  of  Iranian  Presi  dent  Mahmoud  Ahmadinejad  looking  like  a  monkey.   Technology  entrepreneur  Kevin  Bermeister  said  the  game  throws  out  a  challenge  to  Iran  and  its  president,  who  once  vowed  to  wipe  Israel  off  the  map.  “It  puts  people  at  opposite  ends  of  the  spectrum  into  the  same  simula  tion  in  an  environment  where  they  can,  and  do,  communicate  as  equals  and  cause  no  harm,”  Bermeister  said.   “It  can  only  bring  a  greater  under  standing,”  he  added.   But  some  Jewish  leaders  have  scoffed  at  the  idea.   “While  people  are  free  to  pursue  lawful  commercial  enterprises,  the  concept  of  the  game,  and  the  game  itself,  is  both  unhelpful  and  inappro  priate,”  said  Executive  Council  of  Aus  tralian  Jewry  (ECAJ)  president  Robert   Goot.   “I  don’t  think  it  will  have  the  posi   tive  effect  that  its  promoter   advocates”   B’nai  B’rith  Anti-Defamation  Commission  chairman  John  Searle  added  that  the  game  would  only  “com  pound  the  already  complicated  issues  surrounding  the  western  world’s  rela  tionship  with  Muslim  communities  and  its  dealings  with  Iran”.   “I  don't  think  it  will  have  the  positive  effect  that  its  promoter  advocates.""   ROBERT  GOOT  President,  ECAJ   The  game’s  release  follows  the   launch  of  another  controversial  Aus   tralian-designed  online  game  called  Muslim  Massacre,  which  challenges  players  to  shoot  as  many  Muslims  as  possible,  causing  an  uproar  from  the  Australian  Muslim  community.   But  Bermesiter,  who  has  worked  in  the  video  games  industry  for  decades   and  established  the  first  interactive   multimedia  company,  Ozisoft,  argued  the  two  games  are  completely  differ  ent  “Rising  Eagle  has  got  nothing  to  do  with  massacring  Muslims.  In  our  game  there  is  no  disrespect  for  individ  ual  religions  and  cultural  groups,  just  one  armed  fighting  force  playing  against  another,”  he  said. ",2008-11-07
"  PM  urged   to  condemn  terrorism   against  Jews   JOCELYN  ROBUCK   IN  an  impassioned  speech  at  Tuesday  night’s  memorial  service  for  the  Mumbai  victims,  Executive  Council  for  Australian  Jewry  president  Robert   Goot  said  the  Australian  Government   should  strongly  condemn  the  attacks  as  the  “wanton  outrage  of  Muslim  terrorism  perpetrated  in  the  name  of  Allah”  against  specifically  Jewish  targets.   “These  were  not,  as  reported  in  some  media,  the  acts  of  teenage  gun  men.  This  was  a  calculated,  deliberate  act  on  a  Jewish  target,  which  we  now  know  was  selected  one  year  in  advance,”  Goot  said.   “And  unlike  the  other  non-Jewish  victims  in  Mumbai,  it  appears  that  the  victims  in  the  Chabad  House  were  tortured  before  their  executions,”  he  added.   Goot  said  that  Prime  Minister  Kevin  Rudd’s  muted  response  in  the  wake  of  the  attacks  was  in  stark  con  trast  to  Israeli  President  Shimon   Peres’  public  statement  at  the  victims’  funerals  in  Israel:  “Enough.  The  bar  barians  are  at  the  gate.  We  must  recognise  them  for  what  they  truly  are.  They  must  be  repelled.”   Goot’s  remarks  were  met  with  thunderous  applause.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  president  Robin  Margo,  who  agreed  that  most  acts  of  terrorism  were  per  petrated  by  Islamic  fundamentalists,   said  that  some  Muslim  communities   had  spoken  out  to  condemn  the  attacks.  He  reported  that  the  Islamic   ECAJ  president  Robert  Goot:  the   Australian  government  must  condemn  Muslim  terrorism  against  Jews.   Photo:  Ingrid  Shakenovsky   Trust  in  Mumbai,  for  example,  had  refused  to  allow  the  terrorists  to  be  buried  in  its  cemetery,  because  they  were  not  “true  Muslims”.   “It  is  important  to  note  that  these  terrorists  did  not  distinguish  between  Jews  and  Israelis,”  Margo  stressed.  “No  Jewish  building  can  be  safe  while  this  type  of  terrorism  goes  on.”   Referring  to  Rabbi  Pinchus  Feld  man’s  request  for  every  person  at  the  memorial  to  take  on  a  new  mitzvah,  Margo  suggested  an  appropriate  mitzvah  would  be  a  contribution  to  the  Jewish  Communal  Security  Appeal.   Deputy  Chief  of  Mission  Eli  Yerushalmi  said  that  like  killing  dur  ing  the  Holocaust,  the  people  in   Mumbai’s  Chabad  House  were  mur   dered  because  they  were  Jewish.   “The  nature  of  Islamic  fundamen   talism  wants  to  destroy  us  all,  and  Iran  is  seeking  nuclear  weapons  to   achieve  this  goal,”  he  adde&amp;lt;k  v&gt;-^ ",2008-12-12
"  The  next  president  and  the  court  of  public  opinion   AMERICAN  ANGLE  ,   BRUCE  CWOLPEI   The  international  image  of  the  United  States  is   improving,  albeit  it  slowly,   and  there  is  great  trepidation  ahead  of  the  forthcoming  presidential  election.   SHE  good  news  from  the  Pew  Global  Attitudes  Project  -  a  worldwide  survey  of  175,000  people  in  54  countries  and  the  most  authoritative  measure  of  global  pub  lic  opinion  available  -  is  that  the  image  of  the  United  States  is  improv  ing,  the  view  of  Iran  is  darkening,  and  that  the  world  awaits  with  some  hope  the  election  of  the  next  president  of   the  United  States.   The  bad  news  is  that  in  the  places  where  it  really  counts  -  in  those   countries  where  a  fundamental  shift   in  public  opinion  is  really  needed  to  force  a  change  in  the  threat  posture   from  Islamic  fundamentalism  -  the   more  benign  global  trends  do  not   have  much  traction.   In  the  Muslim  world  where  public  attitudes  can  be  reasonably  reliably  measured  -  Egypt,  Jordan,  Lebanon,   Pakistan  and  Indonesia  -  views   towards  the  US  are  still  quite  nega  tive,  and  fears  of  Iran,  even  a  nuclear  tipped  Iran,  are  not  that  pervasive.   Fewer  than  25  per  cent  of  respon  dents  in  Egypt,  Jordan,  Pakistan  and  Turkey  have  a  positive  opinion  of  the  US.  Seventy  per  cent  of  Turks  sur  veyed,  and  60  per  cent  of  Pakistanis,  see  the  United  States  as  an  “enemy”.  While  a  healthy  majority  (62  per   cent)  or  Lebanese  bunnis  see  the  US   favourably,  Pew  could  not  find  (in  an   exercise  reminiscent  of  Abraham  bar   gaining  with  God  over  Sodom)  even  one  Shia  respondent  in  the  Lebanese  sample  who  would  express  a  favourable  opinion  of  the  United   States.   Even  in  the  West,  US  favourability  is  only  53  per  cent  in  Britain,  42  per  cent  in  France,  31  per  cent  in  Ger  many.  So  when  Bush  makes  grand  pronouncements  from  the  Knesset,  and  Condi  keeps  meeting  in  earnest  with  Israelis  and  Palestinians,  and  Bush  keeps  dismissing  Iran’s  dismissal   of  the  West’s  entreaties  on  its  nuclear   program,  Hezbollah  and  Syria  and  Iran  know  that  the  Emperor  has  only  a  few  clothes  on  an  ageing  corpus.   And  on  the  least  controversial  mil   itary  expedition  -  Afghanistan  -  only  majorities  in  the  US  and  Australia  favour  keeping  troops  there  until  the  situation  is  stabilised.  (In  Britain,  it’s  48  to  43  per  cent  between  staying  and   immediate  withdrawal.  There  are  majorities  in  France  and  Germany  for  getting  out  now.)   On  Iraq,  where  the  surge  has  been  underway  for  18  months,  and  Bush  and  Republican  presidential  nomi  nee  Senator  John  McCain  are  loudly  proclaiming  the  surge  a  success,  Pew  reports  that,  “Americans  are  much  less  optimistic  than  they  were  two  years  ago  -  40  per  cent  now  say  efforts  to  establish  a  stable  demo   cratic  Iraqi  government  will  succeed,  down  from  54  per  cent  in  2006.”   On  Iran,  Pew  reports,  “People   around  the  world  hold  mostly  nega  tive  views  of  Iran.  Majorities  or  plu  ralities  in  20  of  24  countries  surveyed  express  unfavourable  opinions  about  the  largely  Shia  nation...  Many  Mus  lim  publics  also  continue  to  express  doubt  about  Ahmadinejad  and  majorities  of  Muslims  in  six  of  eight  countries  with  large  Muslim  popula  tions  are  opposed  to  Iran  acquiring  nuclear  weapons.”   While  those  surveyed  in  j  the  West  are  optimistic  |  that  there  will  be   change  for  the  better  with  either  Barack   Obama  or  McCain,  in  the  Muslim  world,  Japan,  Russia  and   Turkey,  there  is  a  much  more  sanguine  view,  with  little  change   expected  in  US  policy.   Even  in  Muslim  countries  where  Iran  is  viewed  favourably,  there  are  significant  numbers  -  44  per  cent  in  Lebanon,  41  per  cent  in  Egypt,  40  per   cent  in  Jordan  -  that  believe  Iran’s  acquiring  a  nuclear  weapon  poses  some  order  of  threat.  But  this  is  hardly  enough  to  counter  the  whirl  wind  of  fanatical  response  that  would  accompany  any  Israeli  military  strike,  even  as  Israel  rehearses  such  an  exer   cise  over  the  Mediterranean.  Indeed,  in  Pakistan,  which  is  on  the  front-line  of  the  war  on  terror,  only  18  per  cent  view  a  nuclear  Iran  darkly.   There  is  going  to  be  change  in  Washington  from  January  20  next  year.  Pew  finds  an  extraordinary  number  of  people  around  the  world  closely  following  the  US  elections.  While  those  surveyed  in  the  West  are  optimistic  that  there  will  be  change  for   the  better  with  either  Barack  Obama  or  McCain,  in  the  Muslim  world,  Japan,  Russia  and  Turkey,  there  is  a  much  more  sanguine  view,  with  little  change  expected  in  US  policy.   If  the  world  was  voting,  it  would   vote  for  Obama.  “In  20  of  23  countries  surveyed,”  Pew  reports,  “the  percent  age  of  people  having  confidence  in  Obama  to  do  the  right  thing  in  world  affairs  is  higher  than  the  percentage  expressing  confidence  in  McCain.”   But  eight  tough  years  of  terrorism,  war  and,  more  recently,  a  proliferation  of  intractable  crises  -  from  oil  prices   to  inflation  to  the  nuclear  threat  from  Iran  -  have  left  very  little  room  for  even  the  most  adroit  change  of  foreign  policy,  and  renewed  diplomacy,  to  have  much  leverage.  The  superpower  has  greatly  diminished  soft  power.   And  both  President  Obama  or  Presi  dent  McCain  will  have  to  come  to  grips  with  that  next  January.

"  Dutch  Jewish  group  calls   anti-Islamic  film  counterproductive   AMSTERDAM  -  The  umbrella  repre  sentative  group  of  Jewish  communi  ties  in  Holland  called  the  newly  released  anti-Islam  film  by  extreme  right  Dutch  MP  Geert  Wilders  “coun  terproductive”  and  “generalising”.   But  the  country’s  Centraal  Joods  Overleg  (Central  Jewish  Platform)  drew  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  15  minute  film,  entitled  Fitna,  a  Koranic  term  meaning  “strife”,  shows  Muslim  clerics  calling  to  behead  Jews,  quotes  Koran  passages  equating  Jews  to  “pigs  and  monkeys”  and  includes  photos  of  demonstrators  promising  “another  Holocaust”  and  praising  Adolf  Hitler.   The  film,  which  shows  footage  of  the  September  11  terrorist  attacks  fol  lowed  by  the  Madrid  train  bombings,  was  posted  on  the  internet  last  week.   Wilders,  leader  of  the  Party  for  Freedom,  which  holds  nine  of  the  Dutch  parliament’s  150  seats,  said  he  wants  to  show  that  the  Koran  “is  an  inspiration  for  intolerance,  murder   and  terror”.   The  Dutch  Jewish  body  said  Wilders’  film  “was  guilty  of  serious  generalisations”.   “Only  the  negative  elements  of  the  Koran  are  shown,”  it  said,  adding:  “By  presenting  graphics  on  the  explosive  increase  of  the  Muslim  population  in   Holland  and  Europe  in  relation  with  pictures  of  terrorist  attacks  and  with  the  slogan,  ‘Stop  Islamisation,  protect  our  freedom,’  Wilders  suggests  that  all  Muslims  are  potential  terrorists.”   While  the  anti-Jewish  statements  that  Wilders  compiled  demonstrate  “some  Muslim  clerics  have  dreadful  ideas  about  Jews  and  that  even  chil  dren  are  being  brainwashed”,  the  film  only  serves  to  “polarise  Dutch  society  and  is  counterproductive  to  the  fight  against  extremism”,  the  Jewish  body   said.   The  Central  Jewish  Platform  said  it  wants  to  work  with  the  Muslims  in   Holland  and  the  rest  of  the  country  in   order  to  halt  extremism  and  radicali  sation.   Dutch  Prime  Minister  Jan  Peter  Balkenende,  who  was  worried  about  possible  repercussions  for  Dutch  citi  zens  and  economic  interests,  said  he  was  “proud”  of  Dutch  Muslims  for  their  peaceful  reaction  to  the  film.   Dutch  Socialist  newspaper  De  Vdkskrant  stated  that  if  Wilders  had  said  the  same  things  about  Jews  that  he  has  said  about  Muslims,  “he  would  have  been  prosecuted  for  anti   Semitism”   EUROPEAN  JEWISH  PRESS ",2008-04-04
"  Anti-Israel  forces  on  university  campuses   NAOMI  LEVIN   UNIVERSITY  students  in  Sydney  have  been  recently  confronted  with  a  professional-looking  glossy  magazine  that  denies  Israel’s  right  to  exist.   The  magazine,  iDialogue,  which  has  been  viewed  by  The  AJN,  has  been  sold  on  a  number  of  university  campuses  throughout  Sydney.   A  large  section  of  the  magazine  is  hardline  anti-Israel,  and  includes  a  map  of  the  Jewish  homeland  that  has  been  shaded  out  and  labelled  as  “occupied  territory”.  There  is  also  an  image  on  the  front  cover  that  calls  Israel  “Muslim  land”  and  a  sign  that  says:  “Not  for  sale.”   Wassim  Doureihi,  who  is  known  to  work  with  fundamentalist  Islamist  organisation  Hizb  ut-Tahrir,  wrote  the  magazine’s  lead  article.  Hizb  ut  Tahrir  has  denied  it  is  associated  with  the  magazine,  but  a  number  of  Jewish  experts  said  this  week  the  publication  portrayed  all  the  characteristics  of  the  organisation.   Joel  Burnie,  the  Australian/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Committee’s  new  stu  dent  program  coordinator,  said  he  was  concerned  about  the  circulation   of  the  new  quarterly  magazine.   “It  is  of  great  concern  that  Hizb  ut  Tahrir  -  an  organisation  with  beliefs  that  are  antithetical  to  democracy,  the   rule  of  law  and  multiculturalism  and   infamous  for  pushing  rabidly  anti   Semitic  and  anti-Israel  material  -  is   apparently  plying  their  propaganda  of  hate  on  Australian  university  cam  puses,”  Burnie  said.   He  called  on  both  universities  and   law  enforcement  agencies  to  monitor   Hizb  ut-Tahrir’s  activities  and  “make  sure  they  do  not  violate  either  the  law  or  university  rules  concerning  incite  ment  to  racial  hatred  and/or  violence”.   Vic  Alhadeff,  executive  director  of  the  NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies,  said  he  had  been  working  with  the  Australasian  Union  of  Jewish  Stu  dents  (AUJS)  to  help  them  counteract  this  type  of  material  on  campus.   Alhadeff  reviewed  the  magazine  and  said  the  content  was  seriously  anti-Israel.  However,  he  added  that  there  was  a  positive  aspect  to  its  publication.   “It  exposes  the  Islamist  agenda  unambiguously,”  he  said.   “It  states  that  there  is  a  ‘defining  struggle’  between  liberal  democracies  and  Islamism.  It  defines  Israel  as  a  ‘dagger  in  the  heart  of  the  Muslim  bod/.  And  it  insists  that  ‘a  state  of  war’  must  be  maintained  until  the  entire  country  has  been  reclaimed  for   Islam.”   Australian  security  agencies  have  twice  reviewed  the  activities  of  Hizb  ut-Tahrir,  but  it  has  not  been  added  to  government’s  list  of  known  terrorist  groups  in  Australia.  The  organisation  is  dedicated  to  establishing  a  Muslim  caliphate  and  is  banned  in  most  Arab  states  and  a  number  of  countries,  including  Russia  and  Germany  and  parts  of  South-East  Asia.   v-' ",2008-04-18
"  MCCAIN  VS  OBAMA   THE  current  American  elections  have  been  the  most  divisive  in  as  far  as  Israel  is  concerned  among  Jews  in  recent  years;  even  many  Australian  Jews  react  angrily  if  Barrack  Obama  is  criticised  in  the  context  of  Israel.   The  majority  of  American  Jews  have  always  voted  for  the  Democrats  and  these  elections  are  no  different,  regardless  of  the  fact  Republican  President  George  W  Bush  has  been  such  a  strong  supporter  of  Israel  and  on  his  history  and  current  rhetoric,  John  McCain  would  be  a  more  reli-  able  and  committed  friend  to  Israel  than  Obama.  McCain  has  also  indi-  cated  he  would  be  much  harder  on  Islamic  terrorism  than  Obama,   another  major  concern  for  Jews  and   Israel.   Obama  has  already  shown  he  is  beholden  to  the  large  Arab/Muslim  community  in  America,  as  well  as  the  Arab/Muslim  world,  when  he  made  a  major  “flip-flop”  after  telling  a  Jewish   audience  at  an  American  Israel  Pub-  lic  Affairs  Committee  conference  he  supported  Jerusalem  remaining  Israel’s  united  capital,  only  to  back-  track  immediately  after  pressure  from  his  Democratic  Party  comrades.   If  this  very  important  example  of   Obama’s  “so-called”  commitment  to   Israel  did  not  ring  alarm  bells  for  American  “Zionist”  Jews,  while  it  is  their  prerogative  to  vote  for  whoever  they  choose,  I  only  hope  they  know   what  they  are  doing.

Dana  Meallem,  an  Israeli  Jew,  and  Mutassim  Abu  el  Hawa,  a  Palestinian  Muslim,  who  are  visiting  Australia  on  a  speaking  tour,  told  the  group  that  Israel  could  only  tackle  environ   mental  issues  by  working  closely  with  her  neighbours.   The  forum  aimed  to  prepare  the  group  for  the  view  on  the  ground  before  they  embarked  on  a  two-week  study  tour  to  Israel  in  early  September  as  part  of  the  leadership   program.

"  I’M  AFRAID   PROFESSOR  Mark  Baker  asks,  So  who’s  afraid  these  days?”  (AJN25/04),  and  claims  Jews  should  not  be.  Per  haps  when  he  is  writing  from  the  comparative  safety  of  Jew  Hill  at  Monash  University,  where  there  are  no  doubt  enough  Jews  on  campus  to  get  their  voices  heard,  he  need  not  fear  anti-Israeli  propaganda.  It’s  a  dif  ferent  situation  at  my  local  university,  where  Jewish  and  Israeli  students  could  fit  into  a  telephone  booth  and  are  heavily  outnumbered  by  Muslim  and  Arab  students,  and  where  AUJS  is  the  smallest  club  on  campus.   Already  this  year  we  have  wit  nessed  instances  of  the  distribution  of  anti-Israel  propaganda  DVDs  by  the   Muslim  Students  Association  at  a  uni  versity  welcome  day  and  have  had  reason  to  question  whether  there  is  anti-Israeli  sentiment  higher  up  in  the  university  administration  due  to  an  incident  that  occurred  and  against  which  we  protested  to  no  avail.  This  is  in  addition  to  the  expected  pro-Pales  tinian,  anti-Israel  bias  that  is  evident   in  the  lectures  of  academics  in  the  pol  itics  and  history  departments.  Acade  mics  at  a  smallish  regional  university  would  generally  not  want  to  be  seen  as  “rocking  the  boat”,  so  active  support  for  Israel  and  other  unpopular  causes  is  not  usually  forthcoming.   I’m  glad  Professor  Baker  feels  so  secure  at  Monash.  There’s  safety  in   numbers.  Monash  has  the  numbers  —  how  about  most  of  the  other  38  uni  versities  in  Australia?  “Thought  police”  would  not  be  welcome  at  any  university  but  Israeli  and  Jewish  stu  dents  at  smaller  campuses  would  probably  be  grateful  for  AIJAC’s  help.

Eat,  Pray,  Love  by  Elizabeth  Gilbert  deserves  the  first  men-   tion,  as  it  had  a  profound  influence  on  me.  It  tracks  the  journey  of  Gilbert,  a  divorced  New  Yorker  who  set  out  on  a  spiritual  journey  in   India  after  an  emotional  breakdown.

"  World   Hebron  violence  prompts  fears  of  intifada   ANALYSIS   LESLIE  SUSSER   JERUSALEM  -  Concerned  by  settler  violence  against  Palestinians  and  Israeli  soldiers,  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Olmert  has  ordered  Israeli  security  forces  to  apply  a  zero-tolerance  policy   toward  extremist  settlers.   Olmert  and  the  country’s  top  security  officials  fear  that  unchecked  settler  violence  could  spark  a  new  Palestinian  intifada,  enrage  the  Muslim  world  and  compromise  Israel’s  international  standing.   They  are  worried  as  well  about  a   potential  spillover  into  Israel  proper,  where  extremist  settlers  could  target  prominent  left-wingers  or  even  national  leaders.  A  little  more  than   two  months  ago,  prominent  left-wing   Israel  Prize  winner  Professor  Zeev  Sternhell  was  wounded  by  a  pipe  bomb  planted  outside  his  home.   The  latest  setder  rampage  came  last  week  after  Israeli  police  evacuated  settlers  from  a  contentious  building  in  Hebron.  In  a  well-planned  opera  tion,  special  police  forces  surprised  the  estimated  200  inhabitants,  drag  ging  them  out  in  less  than  an  hour.   The  eviction  triggered  a  paroxysm   Israeli  police  struggle  with  a  right-wing  settler  as  they  evacuate  Jewish  extremists   from  the  disputed  house  in  Hebron.  Photo:  JTA   of  settler  violence  against  Palestinians  in  nearby  neighbourhoods.  Settlers  set  fire  to  courtyards  and  olive  trees,  stoned  vehicles  and  passers-by,  and  terrorised  Palestinian  residents.  In  one  case,  a  settler  was  filmed  firing  live  ammunition  from  close  range  and  wounding  at  least  two  Palestinian  men.  Settlers  also  destroyed  head  stones  in  a  Muslim  cemetery  and  spray-painted  slurs  on  mosque  walls.   Meanwhile,  in  front  of  the  dis  puted  Hebron  building,  they  recited  prayers  against  the  government,  the  army  and  the  police.   In  a  cabinet  meeting  on  Sunday,  Olmert  did  not  mince  words.   “The  sight  of  Jews  firing  at  inno  cent  Palestinians  has  no  other  name   than  a  ‘pogrom’,  “  he  declared.  “I  am  ashamed  that  Jews  could  do  such  a  thing.”   The  violent  settler  response  is  symptomatic  of  a  relatively  new  phe  nomenon:  a  growing  numbers  of  rad  ical  settlers  who  feel  alienated  from  the  state,  don’t  accept  its  authority  and  are  ready  to  use  violence  to  prevent  it  from  taking  action  against  settler  interests.   The  eruption  of  violence  in  Hebron  was  not  a  case  of  sponta  neous  anger,  but  part  of  a  calculated  strategy  intended  to  demonstrate  to  Israel  that  it  will  have  to  pay  a  very   Settlers  sit  near  a  Muslim  grave  In  Hebron,  defaced  with  a  Magen  David,  near  the   house  whose  residents  were  evicted  by  Israeli  security  forces  last  week.

This  way,  the  settlers  believe,  they  will  prevent  the  Jewish  settlements  in  the  West  Bank  from  suffering  the  same  fate  as  those  in  the  Gaza  Strip,  which  were  evacuated,  destroyed  and  handed   over  to  the  Palestinians  in  2005.   The  extremist  fringe  is  estimated  at  between  several  hundred  to  a  few  thousand  out  of  the  West  Bank’s  300,000  settlers.  Most  of  the  settlers’  leadership,  including  the  Judea  and  Samaria  Council,  disavow  the   radicals.   The  Shin  Bet  internal  security  service,  which  monitors  radical  Jewish  activities  on  the  West  Bank,  warns  that  extremists  are  ready  to  use  live  fire  to  stop  peacemaking  with  the   Palestinians.   There  is  deep  concern  that  this  sort  of  settler  action  could  spark  a  new  Palestinian  intifada.  Indeed,  Palestinian  leaders  have  warned  that  if  settler  violence  continues,  acts  of  revenge  are  almost  a  certainty.  This  could  spiral  out  of  control  quickly.   JTA ",2008-12-12

"  GROUPS  SLAM  COSTA  RICA  ON  ‘PALESTINE’   NEW  YORK  -  US  Jewish  groups  criti  cised  Costa  Rica  for  recognising  “Palestine”  as  a  state.  Costa  Rica  was  long  a  pro-Israel  stalwart  in  Latin  America  and,  until  2006,  was  one  of  only  two  nations  to  maintain  an  embassy  in  Jerusalem.  Few  states  outside  the  Arab  and  Muslim  world  recognise  Palestine  as  a  state.  The  Palestinian  Authority  is  pressing  nations  to  do  so  as  part  of  a  blitz  ahead  of  its  push  for  statehood  by   next  year.   JTA ",2008-03-07
"  McCartney  vows  to  perform,  despite  death  threat   LONDON  -  Former  Beatle  Paul   McCartney’s  decision  to  perform  in   Tel  Aviv  has  turned  him  into  the   target  of  a  terror  attack,  following  a  threat  made  against  the  singer  by   extremist  Islamic  leader  Omar  Bakri.   His  planned  participation  in  a  concert  celebrating  Israel’s  60th  anniversary  has  made  him  the  enemy  of  all  Muslims,  British  tabloid  Sunday  Express  quoted  Bakri  as  saying.   Bakri’s  threat  was  made  in  a   weekly  internet  broadcast  from  Lebanon,  where  he  has  lived  in  exile  since  being  banned  from  returning  to  Britain.  The  48-year-old  Syrian  national  questioned  the  Holocaust’s  authenticity,  and  asked  how  McCartney  could  participate  in  the  celebration  of  the  independence  of  the  Jewish  State.   “Instead  of  supporting  the  people  of  Palestine  in  their  suffering,  McCartney  is  celebrating  the  atroci  ties  of  the  occupiers.  The  one  who  is  under  occupation  is  supposed  to  be  getting  the  help,”  Bakri  said.   “Our  enemy’s  friend  is  our  enemy,”  the  Muslim  leader  told  the  Sunday  Express  in  an  interview.  “Thus  Paul  McCartney  is  the  enemy  of  every  Muslim.  We  have  what  we  call  ‘sacri   fice’  operatives  who  will  not  stand  by   Former  Beaties  band  member  Paul  McCartney  waves  to  tans  prior  to  his  concert  In   Kiev,  Ukraine.  Photo:  AAP   while  he  joins  in  a  celebration  of  their  oppression.  If  he  values  his  life  Mr  McCartney  must  not  come  to  Israel.   He  will  not  be  safe  there.  The  sacrifice   operatives  will  be  waiting  for  him.”   McCartney,  who  was  apparently  shocked  by  the  threat,  was  deter  mined  to  perform  in  Israel  and   refused  to  cancel  his  show.  His   spokesman  responded  by  saying  that  McCartney  intended  to  come  with  a  “message  of  peace”.  On  Saturday,  McCartney  said  he  was  asked  by  sev   eral  pro-Palestinian  and  political  groups  to  cancel  the  trip,  but  he   declined.   McCartney  is  scheduled  to  per   form  for  thousands  of  Israelis  in   Hayarkon  Park  on  September  25  as  part  of  a  world  tour.   The  Beatles  were  banned  from   touring  Israel  in  the  1960s  during  their  Middle  East  tour,  as  Israeli  offi  cials  were  concerned  that  the  group  would  corrupt  the  nation’s  youth.

"  MISGUIDED  COMPLACENCY   cal  gain  from  our  collective  human  gain  are  intertwined  and  complex,   but  the  Torah  values  we  defend  should  not  be  obscured  by  the  confu  sion  that  reigns  from  those  who   choose  to  attack  us.

Our  Jewish  relationships  with  Muslims,  like  our  relations  with  Christians,  Buddhists,  Hindus  and   people  of  many  other  religions  and  cultures,  have  very  little  to  do  with  blinding  politics  of  nations  like  Iran.  As  Jews  who  remain  committed  to  our  Israelite  heritage,  isn’t  it  time  we  each  took  a  stand  and  did  something  to  fight  against  the  rhetoric  and  innu  endo  that  keeps  us  and  our  culture  on   the  defensive?

"  Community   A  circle  of  community  action   CHAOTALABfTBOL   SOME  students  came  up  with  a  scheme  to  send  seeds  to  a  village  in  a  third-world  country  so  that  they  could  plant  their  own  food.  Others  worked  on  a  “no  pay-no  play”  fundraising  campaign  to  raise  money  at  com  munity  sporting  events  for  charities.   And  while  all  the  students  -  Jewish,  Muslims,  Catholics  -  were  from  different  backgrounds,  it  didn’t  matter.  When  it  came  to  coming  up  with  a  community  project  to  help  the  greater  good,  they  united  under  one   cause.   About  270  students  from  seven  religious  schools  across  Sydney  took  part  in  the  “Values  in  Action  Together”  program,  launched  in  Sydney  by  the  Together  for  Humanity  Foundation  this  month.   The  day  kicked  oh  with  six  classes  of  Moriah  College  year  8  students  travelling  to  different  Catholic,  Islamic  and  Anglican  schools  -  including  the  Punchbowl  Boys  High,  Australian  International  Academy,  Brigidine  College  Randwick,  Strathfield  South  Strathfield  Girls  High  and  St.  Catherine’s.   Once  there,  students  got  down  to  busi  ness,  developing  joint  community  projects  in   groups.   Together  for  Humanity  national  director  Rabbi  Zalman  Kastel  said  the  program  aims   Picnicking  together...  Moriah  College  students  lunched  with  Islamic  students  from  the  Australian   International  Academy  as  part  off  Together  for  Humanity’s  new  exchange  program.   to  “break  down  barriers”  between  religious  groups  at  an  early  age  through  community   service.   “We  try  to  show  them  that  the  beauty  and  goodness  of  the  human  spirit  is  alive  and  well  in  everyperson,”  he  told  The  AJN.  “It  is  an   approach-  that:  hhis  beep  extremely  suc  cessful.  We  have  taken  over  40,000  students  Australiawide  through  the  program.”   Students  appeared  to  take  heed  of  the   message.

She  had  tears  in  her  eyes.

"  HEZBOLLAH  BEAMED  INTO  AUSSIE  HOMES     NAOMI  LEVIN     A  TELEVISION  station  spon-  sored  by  Hezbollah  was  being   broadcast  into  Australian   homes  up  until  late  last  week.   Al-Manar,  the  terrorist  organisation’s  TV  station,  was  being  relayed  into  the  country  by  the  Thai  satellite  company,   Thaicom.  The  Lebanon-based   channel  ceased  operating  last  Friday.   A  Thaicom  spokesperson  told  The  AJN  that  Al-Manar  was  not  being  officially  broad-  cast,  rather  it  was  being  shown  during  a  testing  period.   The  spokesperson  added  that  since  Friday,  the  channel   has  not  been  available  via   Thaicom  in  Asia  or  Europe.  The  station  is  broadcast  by  other  providers  in  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa,  but  is  banned  in  the  United  States,  France  and  Spain.   Responding  to  the  news   that  Al-Manar  might  be  avail-  able  locally,  a  representative   from  the  Australian  Commu-   nication  and  Media  Authority  said  that  an  inquiry  into  the  Hezbollah-supported  channel  would  begin  shortly.  That  inquiry  will  attempt  to  find  out  if  Al-Manar  is  being  received  in  this  country  and  if  it  is,  what   action  should  be  taken.   In  2004,  the  Australian  Broadcasting  Authority  inves-  tigated  Al-Manar  and  found   the  station  did  not  breach  fed-  eral  anti-terrorism  laws.   However,  the  investigation  -  which  was  never  completed  -  found  that  programs  on  the  station  did  breach  its  responsi-  bility  to  present  “accurate  and   fair  news  and  current  affairs”   and  had  likely  broadcast  pro-  grams  that  “incite  or  perpet-  uate  hatred  against  ...  any  person  or  group  on  the  basis  of  their  ethnicity,  nationality,  race  or  religion”.   Al-Manar  ceased  being  broadcast  into  Australia  on  that  occasion  because  its  local  distributors  went  into  receivership.   Dr  Colin  Rubenstein,  exec-  utive  director  of  the  Aus-  tralia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council,  said  Al-Manar  should  be  banned.   “We  will  make  sure  the  new  minister  [Communications  Minister  Senator  Stephen  Conroy]  knows  about  the  sta-  tion’s  background  and  makes  sure  that  it  doesn’t  resume  broadcasting  again,”  he  said.   A  report  into  Al-Manar  from  the  Intelligence  and  Ter-  rorism  Information  Centre  in  Israel  found  the  television  channel  “significantly  increased  the  impact  of  Hezbollah’s  incitement  against  Israel,  the  Jewish  people  and  the  US,  across  the  Muslim  world  and  among  non-Muslim  target   audiences”.

Ban  addressed  the  reception  and  said,  “In  Judaism,  we  believe  that  God  can  forgive  us  for  sins  against  God”,  but  for  sins  against  people,  she  added,  “we  need  to  work  things  out  among  ourselves”.  Ban  stressed  the  impor  tance  of  working  together  and  allowing  everyone  to  “practice  their  religion  freely”.   Mehmet  Saral,  president  of  Affinity  Intercultural  Foundation,  said  that  after  9/11,  “Islamophobia”   had  increased  and  Muslims  had   responded  by  promoting  events  that   celebrated  the  cultural  freedom   enjoyed  in  Australia.

Ferguson  told  the  reception  that  an  increasing  number  of  Australians  supported  diverse  migration  intake,   and  he  cited  the  results  of  the  Scanlon   Foundation  survey.  However,  he  added,  the  survey  results  also  indi  cated  that  some  immigrants  living  in  high-migration  areas  appeared  “less  interested  in  engaging  with  the  broader  community”.   Professor  Stuart  Campbell,  pro  vice  chancellor  of  learning  and  teaching  at  the  University  of  Western  Sydney,  also  spoke  about  two  recent  developments  at  the  university.

"  A  move  to  moderation   IN  the  eyes  of  many,  Phillipe  Karsenty  is  a  modern-day  Jewish  hero.  The   French  lawyer  and  film  critic  first  raised  the  alarm  that  a  September  2000  French  TV  report,  showing  the  apparent  death  from  Israeli  troop  fire  of  Palestinian  boy  Mohammed  al-Durrah,  may  well  have  been  a  hoax.   When  Karsenty  went  public  with  his  view  that  the  report  was  a  fraud,  he  was  sued  for  libel  by  the  TV  network  and  Charles  Enderlin,  the  reporter  who  filed  the  story.  In  May,  a  French  Appeals  Court  ruled  in  favour  of  Karsenty,  finding  he  had  established  enough  evidence  to  suggest  the  report  was   fabricated.   The  al-Durrah  case  is  important  for  several  reasons.  The  shocking  images  of  a  young  boy  in  his  father’s  arms  while  apparently  being  killed  were  seized  upon  by  critics  of  Israel  as  a  prime  example  of  the  excesses  of  the  Jewish  State.  Israeli  official  investigations  quickly  uncovered  that  Israeli  gunfire  was  not  responsible  for  the  boy’s  death,  but  didn’t  go  to  much  trouble  to  publicise  that  fact  At  least  not  until  Karsenty  took  up  the  fight  on  its  behalf.   The  al-Durrah  episode  has  been  labelled  a  blood  libel  against  the  Jews,  with  right-wing  Jews,  in  particular,  citing  it  as  another  example  of  a  sophisti  cated  international  anti-Semitic  conspiracy.  English  writer  Melanie  Phillips  is   the  standard-bearer  of  that  movement   But  we  need  to  be  careful  not  to  pay  too  much  heed  to  the  “world  is  out  to  get  the  Jews”  school.  Granted,  al-Durrah  was  a  shameful  episode  and  doubt  less  other  lies  will  be  told  about  Israel  on  the  international  stage,  but  we  should  be  encouraged  when  experts,  such  as  Nir  Boms  who  recently  visited  Australia  for  Limmud  Oz,  tell  us  there  are  moderate  movements  within  the  Muslim  world  that  are  beginning  to  be  heard.   And  in  a  similar  vein,  we  should  be  further  buoyed  when  Australia/Israel  &amp;  Jewish  Affairs  Council  director  of  international  and  community  affairs  Jeremy  Jones  delivers  the  closing  address  of  a  Muslim  peace  conference  in  Indonesia,  while  wearing  a  tallit   Ultimately,  it  will  be  the  moderates  on  both  sides  who  will  be  the  voices  of  reason  as  Israelis  and  Palestinians  move  towards  coexistence  and  a  lasting  peace,  and  as  Jews  and  Muslims  continue  to  build  bridges.

"  'The  Israeli-Arab  dilemma   ANALYSIS   CAROLINE  GUCK   JERUSALEM  -  Last  Thursday,  a  28  year-old  Israel  Defence  Forces  (IDF)  non-commissioned  officer  was  killed   along  the  border  with  Gaza  by  a  roadside  bomb.  A  Bedouin  from  the  south,  he  served  as  a  combat  tracker.  At  his  funeral,  his  cousin  said,  “He  did  everything  he  could  to  convince  [Bedouin]  youth  to  enlist  in  the  army   to  serve  the  state.  He  said  his  service  was  hard,  but  he  chose  to  defend  his  country.”  Another  cousin  noted  that  almost  all  the  men  in  their  family   serve  in  the  IDF.   At  his  family’s  request,  his  name  was  not  released  to  the  public.  He  was  buried  in  a  non-military  funeral.   The  family’s  request  stemmed  from  fear  that  the  Israeli  Arab  leader  ship  or  terrorists  from  the  Palestinian  Authority  would  take  revenge  on  its  members  for  their  service  to  the  State  of  Israel.  Their  fear  of  violent  attack  outweighed  their  desire  to  have  their  hero  receive  the  public  honours  he  so  richly  deserved  for  sacrificing  his  life  for  his  country.   Contrast  the  fortunes  of  this   family  to  those  of  an  Arab  family  in  Jerusalem  who  also  lost  a  son  last  Thursday.   Last  Friday,  hundreds  visited  a  tra  ditional  Muslim  mourning  tent  in  Jerusalem’s  Jabel  Mukaber  neigh  bourhood  to  pay  their  respects  to  the  family.  The  tent  was  adorned  by  hun  dreds  of  posters  of  the  dead  man’s   An  unrecognised  Bedouin  village  of  6000  residents  In  the  Negev,  which  lacks   electricity,  running  water,  paved  roads  or  other  basic  Infrastructure.  Photo:  JTA   face.  It  was  also  decorated  with  Hezbollah  and  Hamas  banners.   The  tent  was  erected  to  honour  Ala  Abu  Dhaim,  the  man  who  massa  cred  eight  boys  and  young  men  as  they  studied  Torah  at  Yeshivat  Merkaz  Harav.  Dhaim’s  family  did  not  fear  retribution  from  their  fellow  Arabs.  His  neighbours  did  not  demonstrate  against  his  crime.   What  is  going  on  in  Israeli  Arab  society  -  which  comprises  20  per  cent  of  Israel’s  population?  The  radi  calisation  of  the  Israeli  Arab  commu  nity  has  been  observed  over  the  years,  but  former  foreign  and  defense  min  ister  Moshe  Arens  warns  that  it  is   wrong  to  view  Israeli  Arabs  as  a  monolithic  block.  Indeed,  they  are  an  ethnically  and  religiously  diverse  population.   The  current  situation,  in  which  Israeli  Arab   heroes  fear  attack  and  Israeli  Arab  traitors  are   extolled  must  be  turned  on  its  head.   To  start  with,  Israel’s  100,000  Druse,  who  accepted  compulsory  military  service  for  their  young  men  in  1949,  are  integrated  in  Israeli  society.  Indeed,  the  rate  of  Druse  mil  itary  service  is  higher  than  it  is  among  Jews.   The  Circassians  also  accepted  obligatory  military  service  for  their  sons  and  they  too  are  integrated  into  Israeli  society.   Then  there  are  the  Israeli  Bedouin.  Although  Bedouin  are  Muslims,  due  to  their  unique  cultural  traditions,  Bedouin  have  historically  perceived  themselves  as  distinct  from  the  other  Arab  Muslims  in  Israel,  but  are  moving  ever  closer  to  the  Pales  tinian  Arabs  and  away  from  their  Israeli  identity.  Numbering  200,000,   Hamas,  Hezbollah  and  PLO  flags  hang   outside  the  East  Jerusalem  house  of  the  gunman  who  killed  eight  people  at  the  Yeshlvat  Merkaz  Harav  In  Jerusalem.   Photo:  Flash  90   Bedouin  comprise  some  25  per  cent  of  Israel’s  Muslim  population.   Then  there  are  the  Christian   Arabs.  Israel’s  Christian  Arab  popu  lation  is  the  only  flourishing  Chris  tian  community  in  the  Middle  East.  Christians  find  themselves  under  assault  by  authorities  and  Islamic  gangs  across  the  Middle  East,  but  in  Israel,  the  Christian  population  has  grown  steadily  in  recent  years.   Finally  there  are  the  Israeli  Arab  Muslims.  Since  the  1994  establish   ment  of  the  Palestinian  Authority,  the  Israeli  Muslim  leadership  has  been  radicalised.  Many  of  their  leaders  and  organisations  have  worked  steadily  to  undermine  the  Israeli  Arab  Muslims’  sense  of  attachment  to  the  State  of   Israel  and  to  intimidate  dissenting   voices  into  silence.   Arens  believes  the  natural  pull  of  Israeli  Arabs  is  towards  the  Pales  tinians.  To  stem  the  tide,  Israel  must  launch  a  twin  campaign  to  help  those  Israeli  Arabs  who  support  the  state  and  to  encourage  them  to  intensify  their  integration  into  Israeli  society.  And  it  must  take  concerted  action  against  those  radical  leaders  and  organisations  that  work  to  under  mine  those  bonds.

"  Jewish  prisoner  refused  tzitzit   A/N  STAFF   WEARING  tzitzit  is  not  permitted  because  it  provokes  other  inmates,  a  prison  official  allegedly  told  an  Israeli  prisoner  who  is  being  held  in  protective  custody  inside  Silver  water  Correctional  Centre  (SCC).   Dror  Salah,  who  is  facing  murder  charges  next  month,  con  tacted  The  AJN  and  claimed  he  was   being  discriminated  against  because  he  was  Jewish  in  a  largely  Muslim-populated  jail.   He  said  Muslim  prisoners  were  permitted  to  use  prayer  mats,  but  he  had  been  refused  permission  to   have  tzitzit  and  tefillin.   Salah  says  he  was  told  that  wearing  tzitzit  provoked  other  pris  oners  because  they  were  visible  out   side  his  clothes.   Salah  added  that  he  had  been  told  he  could  wear  a  kippah  after  an  application  to  the  prison  chaplain,  but  alleged  he  was  also  informed  he  could  only  wear  it  while  inside  his   cell.   Prison  chaplain  Rabbi  Yoram  Ulman  said  he  was  working  towards  getting  tzitzit  and  tefillin  added  to  the  NSW  Department  of  Corrective  Services’  (DSC)  approved  list  of  religious  items.   “At  the  moment,  tzitzit  have  not  been  listed.  It  is  dependent  on  the  discretion  of  a  jail,”  Rabbi  Ulman   said.   The  rabbi  said  he  had  previously  given  tzitzit  and  tefillin  to  prisoners  at  SCC.  He  added  ,  that  tzitzit  are  usually  not  a  problem,  but  tefillin  could  be,  if  officials  believed  a  pris   oner  was  trying  to  harm  himself.   Rabbi  Menachem  Dadon,  Rabbi  Ulman’s  associate,  confirmed  that  Salah  had  asked  for  tzitzit  and  tefillin,  but  said  he  was  not  per  mitted  to  take  them  into  the  jail.   NSW  Jewish  Board  of  Deputies  CEO  Vic  AlhadefF  said,  as  a  matter  of  principle,  there  should  be  freedom  of  religious  observance  for  all  prison  inmates.   “However,  we  will  raise  this  case  with  the  senior  warden  authorities  to  determine  what  the  reasons  are  for  the  difficulties  which  have  arisen.”   The  NSW  DCS  admitted  that   tzitzit  and  tefillin  were  currently  not  approved  religious  items,  but  said  no  application  had  been  made  to  the  DCS’  chaplaincy  service.   “When  an  application  for  addi  tional  items  to  be  placed  on  the  list  of  approved  religious  items  has  been  received,  it  is  considered  by   the  DCS  administration  for  approval.  Approval  is  usually  given  unless  there  are  serious  security  concerns  about  a  particular  item,”  the  statement  said.   In  a  further  development,  Salah  said  he  would  apply  to  serve  his  term  in  an  Israeli  prison  if  con  victed  in  order  to  avoid  problems  associated  with  his  ethnicity.   An  Israeli  consulate  official  con   firmed  an  Israeli  citizen  could  apply  to  be  transferred  to  a  prison  in  Israel  after  all  appeals  have  been   exhausted.   The  submission  must  be  approved  by  the  State  of  Israel  and   Australia. ",2008-02-15

"  The  Jewish  dilemma  -  where  do  we  stand?   I  As  we  prepare  for  the   |  upcoming  high  holy  days,   !  RABBI  FRED  MORGAN,  in  a  j  recent  sermon,  addresses   Judaism’s  ultimate  dilemma.   B  RECENTLY  participated  in  a   three-person  panel  addressing  the  special  needs  of  minority  groups  in  hospitaL   Ihe  first  speaker,  a  lady  from  the  Greek  community,  explained  that  there  were  common  beliefs  and  prac  tices  within  the  Greek  Orthodox  Church  that  bound  their  community  together,  but  every  member  of  the  community  was  an  individual.  In  hos  pital,  health  professionals  need  to  deal  with  people  as  individuals,  consulting  specifically  with  the  patient  and  his/her  family,  and  not  making  assumptions  about  their  beliefs  or  atti  tudes  on  the  basis  of  their  ethnicity.   As  the  Jewish  member  of  the  panel,  I  stressed  how  theoretically  the  Jewish  religion  lays  down  norms  for  Jewish  behaviour  in  every  situation,  but  in  practice  Jewry  is  very  diverse.  Health  professionals  need  to  respond  to  the  Jew  in  the  bed  before  them,  and  not  judge  individual  Jewish  patients  by  what  they  may  have  read  about  Judaism.   The  Muslim  community  represen  tative  began  by  telling  us  that  Mus  lims  come  from  many  different  ethnic  backgrounds  and  cultures,  and  their  practices  often  reflect  quite  diverse  influences.  But  ultimately  what  is  important,  he  suggested,  is  not  their  ethnic  diversity,  but  the  teachings  of   the  Koran  that  determine  normative  Muslim  behaviour.   I  was  deeply  struck  by  how  the  Muslim  speaker  exactly  contradicted  what  the  Greek  speaker  and  I  had  said  about  individuality.  He  denied  importance  to  the  diverse  social  real  ity  and  cultural  context  of  Muslim  patients,  while  my  Greek  colleague  and  I  were  suggesting  that  the  social  reality  is  much  more  significant  than  the  normative  teachings  of  the  patient’s  religion.  The  two  positions  were  diametrically  opposed   Admittedly  it  was  only  coinciden   tal  that  the  normative  view  came   from  the  Muslim  speaker.  The  panel  might  have  included  a  rabbi  inclined  to  open  his  talk  with  the  normative  Orthodox  Jewish  view,  or  the  Chris  tian  speaker  might  have  been  a  funda  mentalist  quoting  New  Testament  parables  to  the  health  workers.   This  difference  between  the  nor  mative  or  Orthodox  view  of  religious  belief  and  practice  and  the  individu  alistic  or  autonomous  view  is  at  the  very  heart  of  contemporary  contro  versies  surrounding  religion.  The  debate  is  much  more  than  intellec  tual,  often  sparking  deep  emotional  responses  and  real  anger.  It  is  an  ancient  debate,  going  right  back  to   the  Torah.   Deuteronomy,  currently  being  read  in  the  synagogue,  stresses  the  sig  nificance  of  a  central  sanctuary  and  centralised  worship.  No  longer  is  it  acceptable  to  offer  sacrifices  in  Shiloh  or  Bet  El;  all  sacrifices  must  now  be  brought  to  Jerusalem.   The  centralised  sanctuary  corre  sponds  to  what  I  call  normative  Judaism  —  spun  out  by  an  authorita  tive  elite  for  all  Jews  to  follow.  In  par  shat  Re’eh,  centralised,  normative  Judaism  is  contrasted  forcefully  with   Rosh  Hashanah  by  Bla  Krug.   the  view  that  “each  person  does  what  is  right  in  his  own  eyes  [ish  kol  hayashar  b’einav]”  It  is  saying  that  a  common  legal-ritualistic  framework,  called  halachah,  defines  Judaism.   Personal  or  local  minhagim  (cus  toms)  are  not  definitive  within  Judaism.  Individualistic  beliefs  and  practices  drive  us  apart;  the  norms  of  Judaism  bring  us  together.   This  is  the  view  of  Orthodoxy  today.  Indeed,  it  is,  with  appropriate  changes,  the  view  of  all  orthodoxies  -  Jewish,  Christian  or  Muslim.   Classical  Reform  Judaism  took  a  diametrically  opposite  view,  saying  that  it  is  personal  choice  -  the  auton  omy  of  the  individual  -  that  defines  Judaism.  The  norms  that  govern  us  are  ethical.  And  ethical  norms  are  not   just  for  Jews;  they  are  universal.  In  all  other  matters  -  religious  particularity,  ritual  and  observance  -  autonomy  rules.   And  so  classical  Reform  promoted  the  idea  that  observances  that  define  Jews  as  a  particular  ethnic  group  -  kashrut,  life-cycle  rituals  and  so  forth  -  can  be  dispensed  with.  They  do  not  define  what  Judaism  means  as  a  uni  versal  religion;  they  do  not  define  us  as  a  people  with  a  mission  or  purpose  for  humanity.  They  are  up  to  the  indi  vidual  Jew  to  do  or  not,  as  they  wish.   This  view,  too,  was  based  on  par  shat  Re’eh.  The  portion  opens  with  a  famous  expression  of  personal  choice:  “See,  this  day  I  set  before  you  blessing  and  curse  [berachah  uke  lalah]”.  Now,  implies  the  Torah,   choose  between  them.   It  is  in  the  hands  of  every  individ  ual  to  make  the  choice.  That  is  the  autonomy  lying  at  the  heart  of  the  Jewish  understanding  of  what  it   means  to  be  human.   It  distinguishes  us  from  the  angels,  on  the  one  hand,  and  from  beasts  of  the  field,  on  the  other.  It  is  ratified  by  Maimonides  in  his  understanding  of  free  will  as  the  ultimate  human  trait   that  enables  us  to  make  teshuvah  -  to   change  the  course  of  our  lives  and   return  to  God.   For  classical  Reform  Judaism,  and  for  many  Jews  today,  the  enthrone  ment  of  autonomy  is  Judaism’s  great  est  gift  to  humanity—what  Judaism  is  really  about.  Personal  choice  over  rides  all  Torah  norms,  apart  from  the  very  ethical  norms,  which  themselves  illustrate  the  value  of  personal  choice.   1  Classical  Reform   Judaism  took  a   |  diametrically  opposite   j  view,  saying  that  it  is   1  personal  choice  -  the   autonomy  of  the   individual  -  that  defines  Judaism.  The  norms  that  govern  us  are  ethical.   And  ethical  norms  are  not  just  for  Jews;  they   §  are  universal.   The  spiritual  heirs  of  classical  Reform  today  are  primarily  secular  Jews;  that  is,  to  use  the  technical  expression,  “ethical  monotheists”  or—  to  capture  it  more  exactly  -  agnostics  for  whom  Judaism  is  principally  about  living  an  ethical  life,  and  who  assume  that  God  does  not  play  an  active  part  in  our  lives.   But  without  religious  norms,  without  centralised  beliefs  and  obser  vances,  it  is  virtually  impossible  to  maintain  the  sense  of  common   shared  destiny  and  purpose  for  the  Jewish  people.  There  is  no  transmit  table  meaning  behind  rituals  like  bar  mitzvah,  sharing  a  meal,  lighting  can  dles  to  welcome  Shabbat,  and  all  the   rest   These  are  all  centralised  rituals,  so   to  speak  -  the  norms  that  bind  us   together  as  a  people  that  can  then  pursue  a  common  religious  goal  -  the  betterment  of  the  world  —  over  many  generations.   If  we  seek  unity  and  common  pur  pose,  then  we  must  join  and  support  synagogues,  and  incorporate  Jewish  rituals  of  home  and  synagogue  into  our  lives.  There  is  an  obligation  in  this,  the  obligation  that  every  bar/bat  mitzvah  assents  to  when  they  “take  on  the  mitzvot”  of  Judaism.  Without  that  understanding,  a  bar/bat  mitzvah  is  little  more  than  an  elaborate  birthday  party.  Denial  of  normative  Judaism  is  the  fallacy  in  classical  Reform.   But  there  is  another  response  to  this  controversy:  to  live  with  the  dilemma  in  creative  tension.  This  is  the  approach  of  Progressive  Judaism  in  Australia  today.   As  Progressive  Jews,  we  acknowl  edge  that  we  are  autonomous  beings.  We  have  choices  to  make,  and  these  choices  radically  determine  the  qual  ity  of  our  Judaism  and  the  ways  in  which  our  Judaism  impacts  on  our  lives  as  a  whole.  No-one  else  can  or   should  compel  or  coerce  us  to  make   these  choices  as  we  do.   We  have  to  arrive  at  our  religious  understanding  by  ourselves  -  though  we  take  guidance  from  the  sources  of  our  tradition  and  from  the  rabbinic  leaders  whom  we  encounter.  Our  individuality  matters.   But,  at  the  same  time,  we  acknowl  edge  that  we  are  part  of  a  people  who  are  defined  by  religious  norms  and  behaviours  that  are  spun  out  from  Torah.  There  must  be  meaning  to  our  lives  as  Jews  —  to  the  rituals  that  we  have  inherited  from  ages  past  as  well  as  the  creative  rituals  that  are  sustain  ing  Jews  today.  Without  an  apprecia  tion  for  normative  Judaism,  we  are  mere  bystanders  on  the  journey.   By  this  description  of  Progressive  Judaism,  my  guess  is  that  the  majority  of  Jews  in  Australia  are  Progressive  Jews.  That  they  belong  to  Orthodox   synagogues  or  are  religiously  unaffili   ated  is  an  historical  accident,  a  matter  of  family  dynamics  or  due  to  some  other  coincidental  factor.   This  is  not  to  deny  the  obvious  -  that  there  are  many  truly  believing  Orthodox  Jews  and  many  truly  believing  secular  Jews  among  us.  But  my  contention  is  that  many  who  cur  rently  put  themselves  into  one  or  other  of  these  groups  for  social  or  other  non-essential  reasons  are,  in  fact,  Progressive  Jews.   I  would  go  further  to  observe  that  the  Progressive  congregations  are  the  only  Australian  congregations  today  that  face  squarely  this  dilemma  between  the  autonomous  and  nor  mative  views  of  Judaism  and,  with  out  denying  outright  the  validity  of  the  other  view,  struggle  to  live  with   both.   Others  deny  one  or  other  of  the  horns  of  the  dilemma,  saying  every  thing  is  either  normative  or  autonomous.  Progressive  Judaism  acknowledges  the  reality  of  both  options.   After  all,  both  views  emerge  from  within  Torah  itself,  which  is  why  they  are  both  so  strong  in  the  history  of  Jewish  thought.  Progressive  Jews  believe  that  it  is  incumbent  on  us  to  be  like  Jacob-Israel,  always  struggling  with  the  dilemma  of  our  faith.   We  currently  find  ourselves  in  the  month  of  Elul,  preparing  ourselves  for  Rosh  Hashanah  and  Yom  Kippur,  when  we  are  bidden  by  our  tradition  to  ask  ourselves  hard  questions.  What  do  we  truly  believe?  Are  we  being  as  honest  as  we  can  with  ourselves?  What  does  our  Judaism  really  mean   to  us?   This  is  the  time  to  face  up  to  the  dynamics  within  our  religious  lives  and  to  declare  ourselves  openly.   Where  do  you  stand?

"  PEER  SET  FOR  DOHA   ISRAELI  Shahar  Peer  is  set  to  create  history  when  she  becomes  the  first   Israeli  tennis  player  to  compete  in  the  Persian  Gulf  on  Monday.   Despite  the  attention  Peer  has  received  for  competing  in  the  $2.5-mil  lion  Qatar  Total  Open  in  Doha,  the  Israeli  says  she  just  wants  to  play   tennis.   “I’m  really  comfortable  about  what  I  chose.

"  NO  THREAT  TO  MUSLIMS   I  WOULD  like  to  know  how  our  gov-  ernment  can  justify  equating  the  dan-  gers  the  Jewish  community  encounters  from  Islamic  extremism  and  terrorism  with  any  alleged  dangers  that  the  Mus-  lim  community  may  face  (AJN18/01).   What  threat  is  there  to  Muslims  from  extremists,  fanatics  or  terrorist  organisations  that  they  should  receive  similar  amounts  of  government  sub-  sides  for  securing  their  prominent  leaders,  schools,  mosques  and  com-  munity  centres?

"  Dark  clouds  gather  over  Mubarak’s  Egypt   ANALYSIS.  JOHN  R  BRADLEY   CAIRO  -  This  year's  presidential  cam-  paign  featured  vigorous  debate  over  American  policy  toward  Iraq,  Iran,  Pak-  istan  and  Afghanistan.  In  contrast,  Egypt  has  remained  completely  off  the  radar.  This  is  worrying,  because  the  Arab  world’s  most  populous  country  will  pose  a  daunting  challenge  to  the  next  president.   It  has  been  27  years  since  Hosni  Mubarak  took  the  reins  of  power  in  Egypt  following  the  1981  assassination  of  Anwar  Sadat.  President  Mubarak’s  legacy  has  been  one  of  political  repression,  economic  stagnation  and  seething  resentment  on  the  part  of  the  Egyptian  people  -  an  anger  that  now  seems  ready  to  explode.   Egypt’s  domestic  political  discourse  continues  to  be  dominated  by  the  bland  propaganda  of  Mubarak’s  National  Dem-  ocratic  Party,  rather  than  healthy  public   debate.   The  next  popular  revolt  could  well  be  triggered  by  an  announcement  that  the  son  of  the  ailing  Hosni  Mubarak,  Gamal,  will  stand  for  president.  Opposition  to   From  left:  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Olmert,  Jordan’s  King  Abdullah,  Egyptian   President  Hosni  Mubarak  and  Palestinian  President  Mahmoud  Abbas  at  the  Sharm  El  Sheikh  Summit  in  2007.  Photo:  JTA   Gamal  Mubarak  inheriting  the  reins  of  power  is  one  thing  that  unites  all  of  Egypt's  fractious  opposition  groups.   But  public  resentment  of  the  effort  to  promote  Gamal  Mubarak  as  his  father’s  successor  is  only  one  among  the  many  simmering  grievances  that  could  boil  over.  There  is  also  anger  over  the  actions  of  the  secret  police  network,  the  regime’s  use  of  torture,  widespread  corruption  and  the  perception  that  Egypt’s  westernised   elites  are  robbing  the  country  under  the  guise  of  liberalising  its  economy  and  opening  it  up  to  foreign  investors.   All  this  recalls  Iran  during  the  last  days  of  the  Shah.  Opposition  to  the  Shah’s  rule  was  diverse,  as  is  opposition  to  Mubarak  in  today’s  Egypt  -  made  up  of  students,  secularists,  feminists,  Marxists,  anti-imperialists  and  Islamists.  The  Iranian  revolution  began  with  wildcat,  uncoordinated  and  inchoate  strikes  and   rebellions  that  built  upon  each  other.  As  the  unrest  grew,  better-organised  groups  gained  power,  with  the  Islamists  tri-  umphing  because  they  proved  to  be  the  most  disciplined  and  ruthless  force  on  the  scene.  The  analogy  here  is  with  Egypt’s  Muslim  Brotherhood,  the  best  organised  opposition  group.   The  United  States  must  insist  that  the  roughly  $US2  billion  in  annual  aid  to  Egypt  is  explicitly  tied  to  progress  on  political  reform,  especially  free  and  fair  presidential  and  parliamentary  elections,  a  genuine  drive  against  corruption,  and  the  lifting  of  continued  restrictions  on  freedom  of  expression.   The  Mubarak  regime  likes  to  tell  America  that  loosening  its  grip  on  power  would  open  the  door  to  political  upheaval  and  a  potential  takeover  by  the  Muslim  Brotherhood.  In  fact,  that  is  what  Wash-  ington  risks  by  continuing  to  prop  up  Egypt’s  dictator.

"  The  Islamisation  of  Israel’s  capital   ANALYSIS   MORDECHAIKEBAR   RAMA7  GAN  -  When  the  Prophet  Mohammed  established  Islam,  he  introduced  a  number  of  innovations.   He  employed  the  hallowed  person  ages,  historic  legends  and  sacred  sites  of  Judaism  and  Christianity,  and  even  paganism,  by  Islamising  them.  Islami  sation  was  practiced  on  places,  as  well  as  persons:  Mecca  and  the  holy  stone  -  al-Kabah  -  were  holy  sites  of  the  pre  Islamic  pagan  Arabs.   Jerusalem,  too,  underwent  the  process  of  Islamisation:  at  first,  Mohammed  attempted  to  convince  the  Jews  near  Medina  to  join  his  com  munity  and  established  the  direction  of  prayer  (kiblah)  to  the  north,  towards  Jerusalem,  but  after  he  Med  in  this  attempt,  he  turned  against  the  Jews,  killed  many  of  them,  and  directed  the  kiblah  southward,  towards  Mecca.   Mohammed’s  abandonment  of  Jerusalem  explains  the  feet  that  this  city  is  not  mentioned  even  once  in  the   Koran.   The  al-Aqsa  mosque  on  the  Temple  Mount  In  Jerusalem.   Photo:  Wikimedia   Islam  rediscovered  Jerusalem  50  years  after  Mohammad’s  death.  Abd  Allah  ibn  al-Zubayr  rebelled  against  the  Islamic  rulers  in  Damascus,  con  quered  Mecca  and  prevented  pilgrims  from  reaching  Mecca  for  the  Hajj.  Abd  al-Malik,  the  Umayyad  caliph,  needed  an  alternative  site  for  the  pilgrimage  and  settled  on  Jerusalem.  To  justify  this  choice  he  refers  to  a  Koranic  verse   about  the  Farthest  Mosque,  to  which  Mohammed  ascended  on  the  back  of  a   magical  horse.  Many  Muslim  thinkers   ascribe  the  miraculous  account  as  a   dream  of  Mohammed’s.  There  is  also  dispute  as  to  whether  the  mosque  is  in  Jerusalem,  or  near  Mecca.   In  order  to  establish  the  “holiness”  of  Jerusalem  in  Islam,  the  caliphs  of  the  Ummayad  dynasty  invented  many  “traditions”  upholding  the  value  of  Jerusalem.   Another  aim  of  the  Islamisation  of  Jerusalem  was  to  undermine  the  legit  imacy  of  the  older  religions,  Judaism  and  Christianity,  which  consider  Jerusalem  to  be  a  holy  city.  Islam  is  presented  as  the  only  legitimate  reli   gion,  destined  to  replace  the  other  two.   Though  Judaism  and  Christianity  can  exist  side  by  side  in  Jerusalem,  Islam  regards  both  of  them  as  betrayals  of  Allah  and  his  teachings.  The  Islamic  broadcasters  of  the  Palestinian  radio  stations  consistently  make  it  a  point  to  claim  that  the  Jews  never  had  a  temple  on  the  Temple  Mount,  and  certainly  not  two  temples.   Yasser  Arafat,  himself  a  secular  person,  did  exactly  what  the  caliphs  of  die  Umayyad  dynasty  did  1300  years  ago:  he  marshalled  the  holiness  of  Jerusalem  to  serve  his  political  ends.   Since  the  holiness  of  Jerusalem  to  Islam  has  always  been  no  more  than  a  politically  motivated  holiness,  any  Muslim  leader  or  ruler  would  be  put  ting  his  political  head  on  the  block  should  he  give  it  up.  Must  Judaism  and  Christianity  defer  to  myths  related  in   Islamic  texts  or  envisioned  in  Mohammed’s  dreams,  long  after  Jerusalem  was  established  as  the  ancient,  true  centre  of  these  two  reli  gions,  both  of  which  preceded  Islam?

"  ANTI-ISRAEL  AT  UNI   UNIVERSITIES  have  been  at  the  front  line  of  the  Israeli/Palestinian  propaganda  war  for  years.

As  a  regular  visitor  to  universities  to  hear  various  Israeli,  American  or  Zionist  speakers,  I  have  seen  firsthand  how  left-wing  student  groups,  along  with  Arab/Muslim  students,  organise  themselves  to  disrupt  the  speakers,  shout  anti-Israel  slogans  and  intimi   date  the  audience.

"  Student  Politics  Turns  To  Gaza   THARUNKA,  On  20  January,  the  UNSW  Student  Representative  Council  (SRC]  disgracefully  voted  down  a  motion  condemning  Israel's  war  crimes  in  Gaza  moved  by  myself  and  fellow  Postgraduate  Councillor  Craig  Johnson.  We  condemn  Israel's  three-week  bombardment  of  the  Gaza  Strip,  which  has  resulted  in  over  1400  deaths  and  thousands  of  injuries.  The  SRC  should  be  made  accountable  for  its  actions  which  for  the  most  part  are  rarely  relayed  to  the  vast  majority  of  students  despite  affecting  them.  The  President  of  the  SRC,  member  of  the  Labor  students  Charishma  Kaliyanda,  shamefully  tried  to  prevent  the  UNSW  Muslim  students  from  entering  the  room  for  the  purpose  of  observing  the  meeting.  When  the  Muslim  students  were  allowed  inside  the  meeting,  students  representing  the  Australasian  Union  of  Jewish  Students  and  a  few  SRC  members  spoke  against  the  motion,  attempting  to  intimidate  the  SRC  by  arguing  that  if  a  vote  was  cast  in  favour  of  supporting  the  people  of  Gaza,  it  would  be  tantamount  to  anti-Semitism  and  advocating  the  bashing  of  Jewish  students.  This  was  nothing  more  than  fear-mongering  and  manipulation  of  genuine  antiracist  sentiment  to  stop  any  effort  to  condemn  Israel's  war  crimes  in  Gaza.  The  Labor  students  struck  out  portions  of  the  motion  that  supported  taking  immediate  cross-campus  action  and  building  a  citywide  student  campaign  to  call  for  an  end  to  the  invasion  and  blockade  of  Gaza.  Even  the  watered-down,  amended  motion  was  finally  voted  down!  We  condemn  the  SRC  councillors  who  voted  against  the  motion.  We  demand  that  the  UNSW  SRC  show  its  support  for  the  Palestinian  people  and  Arab  and  Muslim  students  at  UNSW  by  organizing  and  funding  a  Palestinian  Solidarity  Week,  which  will  start  from  30  March  (Palestinian  Land  day)  to  3  April.  ANH  PHAM  Postgraduate  Student  Rep.  Councillor  Member  of  Socialist  Alliance  (petition  attached,  with  74  signatures]  Ed  -  Tharunka  was  at  this  meeting  and  noted  two  things.  First,  that  it  was  conducted  in  an  open,  diplomatic  and  democratic  manner  by  the  SRC  President.  And  second,  that  the  Socialist  Alliance  is  as  deeply  passionate  and  committed  as  it  is  lacking  in  civility.   For  the  record,  far  from  turning  Muslim  students  away  at  the  door,  Charishma  personally  invited  the  UNSW  Islamic  Society  to  attend  the  meeting  and  have  its  perspective  heard.  Its  delegates,  and  those  from  AUJS,  were  equally  sincere,  informed  and  practical  about  Gaza's  relevance  to  UNSW  students.  Tharunka  supports  student  protest  and  the  principles  of  the  Socialist  Alliance.  Just  don't  shout  it  in  our  faces,  please.  *Please  find  the  SRC  President's  response  overleaf.   LETTERS   Anh  Pham  has  covered  campus  with  posters  of  his  letter.  The  contents  have  deeply  concerned  at  least  one  international  student  who  now  believes  our  SRC  President  may  be  racist.  The  President  replies  to  him,  and  other  concerned  students,  below.  DEAR  CHARLES,  I  thank  you  very  much  for  both  your  concern  and  interest  in  the  matter  that  has  been  brought  to  your  attention.  I  agree  that  if  I  had  no  knowledge  of  what  had  occurred  and  had  just  read  what  was  written  on  those  posters,  I  would  be  quite  concerned  also.  I  would  like  to  set  the  record  straight  as  I  believe  what  was  written  in  that  petition  regarding  the  events  of  the  most  recent  SRC  meeting  manipulate  the  truth  and  blatantly  defame  me.  Firstly,  neither  I  nor  any  member  of  the  UNSW  SRC  attempted  to  block  access  to  anyone  based  on  apparent  race  or  religion,  and  I  find  that  accusation  to  be  quite  insulting.  As  both  Councillors  Anh  Pham  and  Craig  Johnson  are  quite  aware  (since  they  were  standing  right  next  to  me),  UNSW  student  identification  was  requested  from  all  of  those  who  were  not  SRC  members  or  who  had  not  been  expressly  invited  to  attend.  Given  that  this  was  a  meeting  of  the  UNSW  SRC,  I  do  not  see  how  this  was  unreasonable.  Contrary  to  the  assertion  that  I  stopped  ""UNSW  Muslim  students""  from  observing  the  meeting,  I  in  fact  invited  representatives  from  both  the  UNSW  Islamic  Society  (ISOC)  and  the  Australasian  Union  of  Jewish  Students  (AUJS)  to  attend,  observe  and  speak  at  the  SRC  meeting  regarding  the  motion  that  was  on  hand.  Accusations  of  intimidation  on  the  part  of  either  these  invited  representatives  or  members  of  the  SRC  are  ludicrous.  The  only  intimidatory  behaviour  I  observed  was  perpetrated  by  one  of  the  uninvited  observers,  who  repeatedly  shouted  ""bullshit""  and  ""disgusting""  as  an  SRC  Councillor  attempted  to  speak.  The  SRC  is  comprised  of  generally  progressive  students  of  different  political  affiliations.  Obviously  the  conflict  in  Gaza  is  a  sensitive  issue,  but  a  motion  was  not  passed  as  there  was  not  consensus  (of  at  least  a  simple  majority  of  the  SRC)  on  an  adequate  course  of  action  that  involved  and  was  relevant  to  UNSW  students.  It  does  not  mean  that  we  have  ""chosen  a  side""  or  are  unsympathetic  to  the  Palestinian  people.  Voting  against  a  motion  that  may  incite  anti-semitism  does  not  indicate  a  person's  opinion  or  standpoint  on  the  broader  issue  of  Gaza.  Your  ideas  of  organising  an  open  debate  about  the  issue  or  organising  a  Palestinian  Awareness  Week  are  interesting  -  and  were  not  included  in  the  original  motion  submitted  by  Councillor  Anh  Pham.  I'd  suggest  that  you  or  anyone  else  interested  in  pursuing  such  courses  of  action  contact  our  Ethnic  Affairs  Department  (ethnicOarc.unsw.edu.au).  The  Ethnic  Affairs  Officers  would  be  more  than  happy  to  work  with  interested  students.  The  UNSW  SRC  seeks  to  represent  and  support  all  UNSW  students  -  allegations  such  as  those  made  on  the  petitions  only  undermine  the  work  we  attempt  to  do  and  foster  ill  feeling  between  sections  of  our  university  community  and  their  student  representatives.  This  is  inexcusable  as  it  prevents  students  who  may  be  experiencing  racism  or  discrimination  from  getting  help  and  support  where  it  is  available.  I  demand  an  immediate  and  public  apology  from  the  authors  of  the  petition  for  falsely,accusmg  me  of  racist  and  obstructive  behaviour.  Such  accusations  are  outright  lies  that  harmfully  misrepresent  what  occurred  at  the  20th  January  meeting  of  the  SRC.  If  you  have  further  questions  or  comments  about  this  issue,  please  do  not  hesitate  to  contact  me.  I  would  also  like  to  invite  you,  or  any  other  UNSW  student  who  is  interested,  to  the  February  meeting  of  the  SRC  -  to  be  held  at  5.30pm  on  Tuesday  17th  February  in  Training  Room  2  [Level  1)  of  the  Blockhouse  at  the  Kensington  campus  of  UNSW.

"  REVIEWS   Slumdog  Millionaire   SEAN  LAWSON   Slumdog  Millionaire  is  a  little  like  City  of  God  and  takes  some  inspiration  from  various  Indian  movies  most  of  us  have  never  seen.  However  this  is  not  stereotypical  'Bollywood'  with  the  random  dancing  and  high-pitched  singing  (how  do  Hindi  language  singers  hit  those  insanely  high  notes?).  It's  not  a  good  foreign  film,  it's  just  good.  Slumdog  Millionaire  centres  on  the  titular  slumdog  Jamal,  a  Bombay  slum  kid  turned  call-centre  tea  boy,  who  wins  a  shiteload  of  rupees  on  the  Indian  equivalent  of  Who  Wants  to  be  a  Millionaire.  Naturally  in  a  country  of  caste  systems  and  massive  poverty,  people  think  the  poor  uneducated  dude  cheated.  It  turns  out  that  through  sheer  coincidence  all  the  questions  are  related  to  episodes  of  his  life  experience.  The  police  interogation  over  his  'cheating'  sets  up  a  neat  flashback  structure  for  telling  the  story  as  he  recounts  how  he  knew  each  answer.  Without  spoiling  too  much,  the  plot  is  basically  that  Jamal  has  had  a  very  tough  life  and  that  India  is  a  shit  place  to  be  poor.  There's  slum  kids  outwitting  police  and  playing  cricket,  Hindu-Muslim  riots,  orphans,  gangsters,  lots  of  colour  and  chaos,  and  a  sprawling  energy  which  makes  Mumbai  feel  huge,  crazy,  and  all-  absorbing.  Casting  director  Loveleen  Tandan  is  credited  as  ""co-director""  and  she  made  this  movie  brilliant.  I  doubt   even  Danny  Boyle  could  have  made  something  so  rich  and  genuine-feeling  in  this  Mumbai  setting  without  her.  She  was  as  a  general  creative  bridge:  making  the  slum  location  shoots  happen,  translating  some  dialogue  into  Hindi,  casting  street  kids  instead  of  middle-class  English  speaking  child  actors.  As  a  reult  it  feels  more  Indian  and  less  like  Trainspotting  with  Indian  dudes.  There's  tragedy,  but  it's  not  preachy  or  a  thinkpiece,  and  it's  fun  and  captivating  despite  the  blind  kids  and  gangsters  and  poverty.  Oh  and  there's  a  completely  extraneous  Bollywood  dance  number  during  the  closing  credits,  just  in  case  you  were  in  any  doubt  about  how  you  should  feel  upon  leaving.

"  Afghan  police  on  home  turf   THE  first  class  of  Afghan  policemen  who  will  work  alongside  Australian  forces  has  gradu  ated  in  Oruzgan  province.  The  graduates  form  the  basis  of  the  new   Oruzgan  Provincial  Police  Reserve  Company,  and  have  recently  completed  three  months  of  mentoring  by  Special  Operations  Task  Group  (SOTG)  soldiers.  ,  .

"  Tliming  up  the  heat   Breaking  the  barriers  a  challenge  in  Sudan   By  FLGOFF  Eamon  Hamilton   BREAKING  through  multiple  language  barriers  in  the  midst  of  one  of  Africa's  worst  ongoing  con  flicts  while  loading  cargo  on  a  30-   tonne  helicopter  was  all  in  a  day  s  work  for  FLTLT  Andrew  Miller.  FLTLT  Miller  was  deployed  for  six  months  to  the  Darfur  region  of  Sudan  as  part  of  Operation  Hedge  row.  Operation  Hedgerow  is  the  ADF's  commitment  to  the  African  Union-United  Nations  Mission  in  Darfur  (UNAMID),  a  26,000-strong  peacekeeping  operation  in  central  Africa.  Since  2003,  violence  between  rebels  and  tribal  elements  against  government  troops  and  militias  has  resulted  in  about  450,000  people  being  killed,  including  members  of  UNAMID.  In  August  2008,  the  ADF  initi  ated  Operation  Hedgerow,  with  an  eight-person  strong  commitment  to  provide  logistics  and  move  ments  support  to  the  UNAMID  Headquarters  element  in  the  town  of  El  Fashir.  Deployed  as  the  Movements  Control  Officer  in  El  Fashir  from  August  2008  to  February  this  year,  FLTLT  Miller  was  the  first  RAAF  member  to  deploy  as  part  of  Hedgerow.   Two  other  RAAF  members  remain  -  FLTLTs  Nicole  Strybosch  and  Kevin  Brent.  FLTLT  Miller  said  his  role  was  to  plan  and  co-ordinate  the  move  ment  of  cargo  and  personnel  in  the  Darfur  region  using  UN  fixed  wing  and  rotary  assets.  ""Predominately,  this  encom  passed  movement  of  contingent-  owned  equipment  (vehicles,  tents,  rations,  water,  ammunition,  etc)  and  also  rotation  of  the  African  battalions  in  and  out  of  Darfur,""  he  said.  ""We  worked  closely  with  mil  itary,  police  and  civilians  from  a  wide  variety  of  African  countries,  including  Kenya,  Gambia,  Rwanda,  Egypt,  Ethiopia  and  Nigeria.""  El-Fashir  is  an  important  provin  cial  capital  in  Darfur,  but  is  more  than  1200km  from  the  port  of  Sudan  on  the  Red  Sea,  with  little  in  the  way  of  local  infrastructure  to  make  supporting  the  UNAMID  mission  an  easy  task.  ""We  had  a  limited  number  of  trucks,  forklifts  and  loaders,  as  well  as  air  assets,  in  which  to  move  the  ever-increasing  backlog  of  cargo  and  equipment  coming  in  from  the  Port  of  Sudan,""  FLTLT  Miller  said.  ""The  poor  condition  of  the  roads  and  runways  also  compounded  the  problem.""   Previous  experiences  as  Air  Movements  Officer  at  RAAF  Base  Richmond  did  little  to  prepare  him  for  the  unique  challenges  that  he  faced  in  Sudan.  ""Learning  to  do  business  'the  UN  way',  operating  under  a  differ  ent  set  of  rules  and  culture  did  take  some  getting  used  to,""  he  said.  ""The  language  barrier  was  also  another  obstacle  -  trying  to  co  ordinate  the  loading  of  a  shipping  container  on  to  an  Mi-26  chopper  with  a  Russian-speaking  loadmas-  ter  and  an  Arabic-speaking  forklift  driver  was  a  frustrating  yet  amus  ing  experience  I  will  not  soon  for  get.""  The  obstacles,  however,  made  success  and  cooperation  all  the  more  fulfilling.  ""There  was  certainly  some  pro  fessional  fulfilment  in  being  able  to  pass  on  ADF  methods  of  operation,  as  well  as  expertise  and  experience,  to  our  UN  and  African  Union  part  ners,""  he  said.  ""Overall  it  was  a  very  unique  experience.  Being  able  to  work  with  such  a  wide  variety  of  African  militaries  and  gaining  a  first-hand  insight  into  the  African/Muslim  cul  ture  was  a  fantastic  and  worthwhile  opportunity.  ""I  hope  the  mission  continues  to  push  ahead  and  achieve  all  that  it  has  set  out  to  do  in  Darfur.""

"  This  is  not  the  way  of  Alan  Zeino   What  occurred  on  the  night  that  does  deserve  comment  was  that  Alan  gave  a  big  'fuck  you'  to  the  whole  event,  its  organisers,  and  the  world  view  which  they  represent:  namely,  religious  belief.  Atheists  are  often  torn  as  to  how  to  respond  to  religious  belief  of  the  sort  that  takes  advantage  of  the  tolerance  of  the  state  (tax  breaks,  control  of  schools)  while  seeking  to  stifle  the  ability  of  others  to  do  the  same  (gay  marriage,  abortion  rights).  Some  respond  by  writing  books,  giving  interviews  and  generally  engaging  in  rational  debate.  This  is  not  the  way  of  Alan  Zeino.  At  the  very  beginning  of  the  event,  as  people  found  their  seats  and  waited  for  stuff  to  happen,  a  notice  was  put  on  the  overhead  screen  saying  ""We  request  our  respected  guests  to  please  observe  the  seating  arrangements  as  organised  by  the  organisers.  We  request  that  women  sit  in  the  back  half  of  the  room  and  men  in  the  front  half.""  This  is  the  kind  of  thing  that  puts  the  lie  to  secular  democratic  theory.  I  suppose  we  are  meant  to  respect  the  right  of  religious  people  not  to  respect  us.  This  malarkey  is  bad  enough  in  mosques,  but  we  were  in  a  university  campus  lecture  theatre  for  goodness'  sake.  On  this  note,  the  host  formally  opened  proceedings.  Uthman  Badar,  member  of  Hizb  ut  Tahrir  and  UWS  PhD  student  researching  Islamic  Economics,  had  the  privilege  of  speaking  for  the  first  twenty-five  minutes.  Uthman  is  a  practised  hand  at  these  debates.  There  is  youtube  footage  of  him  giving  the  same  sermon  in  2008.  He  has  a  vernacular  charm  and  understated  charisma  (think  John  Saffran)  that  invites  you  to  consider  his  opinions  with  an  open  mind.  And  so  I  did,  for  the  first  minute  or  so.  But  Uthman  ended  up  saying  or  carefully  implying  all  the  usual  things.  That  our  lives  need  a  sense  of  purpose  which  only  god  can  provide.  That  we  need  something  to  tell  us  ""how  to  act  correctly  in  life  and  be  successful"".  That  people  who  do  not  believe  in  ""God  before  life  and  accountability  after""  are  either  hedonists  or  have  no  purpose,  and  base  their  actions  on  ""whatever""  they  like.  Which  is  why  religious  regimes  have  been  so  much  nicer  to  live  in  than  secular  ones,  I  suppose.  On  one  level  there  is  no  problem  with  ""faith"";  it's  when  you  try  to  dress  it  up  as  something  people  just  have  to  inevitably  believe  that  you  enter  dangerous  territory.  Uthman,  just  like  evangelists  before  him  on  the  Christian  side,  had  the  hide  to  say  that  Islam  is  not  a  ""faith-based""  or  ""fidestic""  religion.  It  is  not  based  on  leaps  of  faith,  but  grounded  in  the  ""rational  method"".  The  same  old  snake  oil.  Predictably,  it  all  came  down  to  the  old  'first  origins'  argument.  Everything  has  a  cause,  therefore  the  beginning  of  the  universe  must  have   a  cause.  Ergo,  God  exists.  No  explanation  of  what  caused  God.  Turtles  all  the  way  down.  But  you  can  go  elsewhere  for  comprehensive  rebuttals  of  all  this.  I  think  there  are  two  kinds  of  faith.  One  is  a  private  resource  some  people  draw  on  for  emotional  consolation  and  confidence.  They  may  not  defend  the  logic  of  their  faith,  they  may  admit  that  it's  a  bit  illogical,  but  they  keep  it  as  a  psychological  cushion  for  use  in  hard  times.  That  kind  is  mostly  harmless  to  other  people.  The  other  kind  of  faith  is  a  world  view  that  rivets  the  believer's  identity  to  an  entire  rigid  ideology.  These  are  the  types  who  speak  out  and  influence  public  policy,  or  provide  a  constituency  and  therefore  power  to  those  who  do.  Judge  for  yourself  whether  the  results  have  hurt  social  progress:  our  failure  to  extend  marriage  rights  to  all  consenting  adults  regardless  of  sexuality;  some  significant  resistance  against  the  recent  change  in  our  overseas  aid  contributions  to  reproductive  health  clinics  that  offer  abortion;  Brendan  Nelson's  attempts  in  2006  to  insert  'intelligent  design'  into  the  science  curriculum  at  high  schools;  Catholic  schools  sacking  single  mothers.  These  are,  or  lead  to,  demonstrable  harms.  Why  is  belief  in  God  responsible  for  them?  Because  it  simplifies  ethics  into  a  system  of  ""objective  morality""  (believers  use  this  term  often  and  proudly).  Cost/benefit  analysis  should  be  the  measure  of  every  policy  debate,  not  adherence  to  strict  and  inflexible  rules  of  conduct  taken  from  religious  texts  or  customs.  Learning  to  constantly  detach  ourselves  from  our  opinions  is  the  cornerstone  of  a  liberal  education;  it  is  more  important  to  be  right  than  to  have  been  right.  Belief  in  God  implies  absolute,  objective  morals  and  seizes  up  the  minds  of  enough  people  to  cause  the  rest  of  us  problems.  There  was  something  awesome  about  what  Alan  did  to  these  people  and  their  event.  At  first  I  thought  he'd  given  up  this  excellent  opportunity  to  change  a  few  wavering  minds.  Now,  though,  I  think  of  Alan's  twenty  minute  comedy  routine  as  a  work  of  art.  I  watched  the  organisers,  listening  to  Alan,  waiting  for  him  to  address  the  topic  of  the  debate,  looking  at  each  other  with  expressions  that  said  ""he's  making  fun  of  this  whole  thing,  we've  seen  this  before"".  And  if  I  hadn't  actually  been  in  the  audience  and  been  infected  by  the  anger  and  hostility  I  would  have  found  it  immediately  hilarious.  Uthman,  his  time  running  out  but  with  so  much  more  to  tell  us,  wondered  aloud  how  he  could  fit  it  all  into  his  last  few  minutes.  Alan:  ""I'll  be  like,  five  minutes.  You  can  take  my  time.""  The  organisers  gazed  at  Alan,  confused.  This  frisson  of  anarchy  was  the  prelude  to  the  pure  theatre  that  followed.   Alan's  first  words  once  he'd  finished  playing  around  with  the  mic  and  fixed  his  coat  into  a  suitably  lank  hang,  were  these:  ""I  just  want  to  say,  to  all  my  Muslim  brothers  and  sisters  out  there,  thank  you.  Thank  you  for  replacing  South  Americans  as  the  villains  in  Hollywood  movies.  I  am  South  American  and  we've  been  misrepresented  for  too  long.""  The  crowd  shifted  restlessly,  murmuring  disapproval.  He  went  on.  ""This  topic  is  pointless,  and  I'll  tell  you  why.  Nobody  is  going  to  change  their  minds  tonight.""  Finally,  one  old  dude  had  had  enough.  He  raised  his  hand  and  complained  tremulously,  ""Excuse  me,  excuse  me  -  we  came  here  to  discuss  the  topic,  not  to  have  funny  times.  Does  God  exist,  does  he  not  exist?""  This  followed  by  some  mumbling  and  more  hand  waving.  Alan:  ""I'll  get  to  that,  but  let  me  finish  what  I  want  to  say  about  Sheikh  Al  Hilaly.""  This  was  the  realisation  Alan  wanted  to  offer  that  would  solve  people's  addiction  to  faith:  ""We  are  not  important,  human  beings  are  nothing  in  the  universe.  What's  a  Z-grade  celebrity  you  know?  We're  that!""  Religion  is  just  a  symptom  of  human  specieism  and  we  should  all  get  over  ourselves,  he  argued.  I  wanted  to  criticise  Alan  for  being  soft  on  religion,  but  then  I  remembered  the  logic  of  what  he  said  under  his  breath.  He  told  the  crowd  that  he  wasn't  like  those  'idiots'  who  think  that  religion  poisons  everything;  he  was  able  to  see  the  value  of  religious  opinion  in  a  secular  democracy,  and  he  liked  having  religious  voices  as  part  of  the  discourse  because,  to  paraphrase,  ""it's  funny"".  Insert  image  of  punching  bag.  Religion  motivates  a  lot  of  bad  things  without  doing  much  if  any  good.  This  is  worth  getting  angry  about  and,  I  suppose,  there  may  also  be  a  responsibility  to  help  change  people's  minds.  On  one  level,  outright  mockery  of  religious  belief  for  one's  own  amusement  isn't  really  living  up  to  that  aim.  But  because  it  is  funny,  and  because  I  just  think  they  deserved  it,  the  Alan  way  is  perfectly  legitimate.  Sure  it  was  nonsensical.  Belief  in  God  is  nonsensical.  Sometimes  you  just  have  to  fight  fire  with  fire.  I  left  the  debate  just  as  Uthman  got  up  to  speak  for  another  thirty  minutes,  Alan's  remaining  time  having  been  hastily  cancelled.  As  I  pondered  Alan's  fearless  nihilism,  I  was  reminded  of  the  protagonist  from  Albert  Camus'  The  Outsider.  Like  Meursault,  Alan  Zeino  is  ""the  only  Christ  that  we  deserve."" ",2009-11-06

"     Earlier  this  year,  Kyle  and  Jackie  0  ran  an  appropriately  titled  segment  called  ""Heartless  Hotline"".  The  format  was  this:  someone  with  a  worthy  cause  would  call  in  and  present  a  case  for  why  she  or  he  should  get  $1000.  The  lines  would  stay  open  for  thirty  seconds,  during  which  brazen  listeners  could  ring  up  and  by  virtue  of  simply  demanding  the  money  and  dismissing  the  caller's  cause,  could  snipe  the  money  for  themselves.  It  was  a  zero  sum  game:  either  the  money  went  to  the  caller  or  the  listener.  One  day,  an  obese  young  woman  who'd  suffered  two  strokes  by  age  24  rang  in  to  ask  for  the  money  for  a  stomach  stapling  operation.  It  was  a  foregone  conclusion  that  she  wasn't  going  to  get  it.  Far  from  inspiring  concern  and  support,  fat  people  are  blamed  and  judged  for  their  own  condition.  Weight-hate  is  widespread,  unchecked  and  very  destructive.  Fat  people  are  labelled  greedy,  weak,  stupid  and  lazy  -  slobs  who  chose  to  be  fat  by  refraining  from  jogging  or  eating  lettuce.  And  as  if  these  pre-formed  judgments  of  their  character  weren't  bad  enough,  they're  considered  ugly  and  sexually  repulsive  as  well.  Being  the  butt  of  fat  jokes  or  finding  it  hard  to  pick  up  isn't  much  fun,  but  fat  hate  goes  way  beyond  that.  Fat  people  face  significant  discrimination  in  education,  the  workplace  and  even  in  healthcare.  One  American  study  found  that  thin  workers  were  more  likely  to  receive  promotion.  In  Australia,  half  of  obese  individuals  have  felt  humiliated  by  health  professionals  because  of  their  weight.  Most  scarily  of  all,  even  parents  discriminate  against  their  own  fat  children.  Another  American  study  found  that  parents  provide  less  financial  support  for  their  overweight  compared  to  their  non-overweight  children  who  go  to  college,  even  after  adjusting  for  income  and  grades.  Clearly,  weight-hate  is  a  serious  business.  But  is  it  fair?  The  thing  that  legitimises  hating  fat  people  compared  to  hating,  say,  women,  is  that  obesity  is  seen  as  the  fault  of  the  individual  concerned.  The  problem  is  that  this  just  doesn't  fly.  Obesity,  although  not  an  illness  itself,  is  a  lot  like  most  illnesses  in  that  it  arises  from  a  complex  interaction  of  a  bunch  of  factors,  including  genetic,  familial,  environmental,  cultural,  and  individual.  Hating  on  someone  who  is  overweight  is  like  hating  on  someone  for  sucking  at  playing  the  piano. &lt;p&gt;   Individuals  simply  don't  have  an  equal  opportunity  to  maintain  a  healthy  weight.  For  starters,  genetic  factors  partially  determine  things  like  appetite  and  metabolism.  There's  also  the  family  environment.  Starting  in  infancy  and  continuing  right  until  a  person  becomes  independent,  palettes,  meal  sizes  and  other  eating  practices  are  largely  shaped  by  what  and  how  parents  feed  their  children.  Eating  and  exercise  habits  formed  in  early  life  heavily  inform  how  an  individual  will  eat  and  exercise  in  adulthood.  Blame  doesn't  make  sense  here,  because  kids  can't  pick  their  parents  and  or  control  what  food  they  receive.  It's  a  faux  pas  to  express  contempt  for  Muslims  or  empowered  women,  but  anti-discrimination  norms  just  don't  seem  to  apply  to  overweight  people.  Even  in  adulthood,  the  buck  doesn't  stop  at  individuals  who  make  unhealthy  decisions  for  themselves  or  their  children.  The  ""social  determinants  of  health""  is  a  term  that's  bandied  around  a  lot  in  public  policy  debate.  Rightly  so,  because  it  identifies  that  broader  social  policy  and  inequity  has  a  considerable  impact  on  individual  health.  Not  everyone  has  the  same  amount  of  time,  money  and  energy.  If  you're  a  single  parent  working  two  jobs  to  make  ends  meet  for  your  family,  the  idea  of  going  out  to  shop  for  expensive  raw  ingredients  after  an  exhausting  day  of  work,  getting  home,  cooking  a  meal,  serving  the  food  and  cleaning  up  is  a  very  difficult  option  compared  to  the  Hungry  Jack's  Stunner  Deal,  which  includes  a  cheeseburger,  fries,  a  Coke  and  a  sundae  for  the  epically  bargain  price  of  $4.95.  Or  take  education  and  information  provision,  a  responsibility  which  rests  with  government.  Even  though  most  people  already  understand  that  diet  and  exercise  are  important,  token  government  campaigns  never  go  beyond  'duh'-type  messages,  telling  us  to  eat  fruit  and  veg  and  'get  active'.  The  unfortunate  thing  is  that  useful,  detailed  information  about  what  exactly  healthy  diet  and  exercise  habits  are  and  how  to  form  them  are  much  more  accessible  to  the  welleducated  and  wealthy.   Hating  on  someone  who  is  overweight  is  comparable  to  hating  on  someone  for  sucking  at  playing  the  piano.  It's  dieticians  and  exercise  physiologists,  'luxury'  healthcare  professionals  whose  services  are  by  and  large  not  covered  by  Medicare,  who  are  currently  best  placed  to  explain  important  concepts  to  patients.  They  have  the  time  and  expertise  to  explain  the  difference  between  good  fats  and  bad  fats,  glycaemic  index  versus  glycaemic  load,  how  to  read  nutritional  information  on  the  packaging,  the  importance  of  combining  aerobic  exercise  with  resistance  training.  Those  who  can  pay  get  individually  tailored  programs,  telling  them  exactly  how,  what  and  when  to  eat  and  exercise.  It's  hardly  the  fault  of  the  individual  when  he  or  she  can't  afford  practical  advice  or  doesn't  know  to  seek  it  out.  Watching  Glee  or  Facestalking  are  probably  reasons  why  people  don't  go  jogging  afterwork,  but  there  are  other  reasons  too  that  have  nothing  to  do  with  laziness.  A  lot  of  people  who  would  otherwise  enjoy  cycling  opt  for  a  car  ride  instead,  not  wanting  to  risk  their  limbs  or  their  lives  in  what  are  joke  bike  lanes  in  Sydney,  courtesy  of  haphazard  city  planning.  In  many  'low  socioeconomic'  neighbourhoods,  crime  is  a  big  concern,  and  people  are  often  simply  too  afraid  to  go  out  at  night  to  exercise.  Pointing  fingers  at  a  minority  group,  whether  they  be  obese  or  Indigenous  Australians,  is  misguided  and  destructive.  Fat  hate,  in  particular,  goes  unchecked  because  it's  socially  acceptable.  It's  a  faux  pas  to  express  contempt  for  Muslims  or  empowered  women,  but  anti-discrimination  norms  just  don't  seem  to  apply  to  overweight  people,  even  among  the  liberal,  university-educated  types.  It's  often  considered  funny  to  joke  about  how  repulsive  fat  people  are.  This  is  particularly  tragic  when  you  consider  that  socially  marginalised  groups  are  being  doubly  punished.  Not  only  do  they  endure  disadvantage  and  higher  obesity  rates,  they  also  have  to  put  up  with  the  discrimination  and  mockery  that  comes  with  being  overweight.  Obesity  is  a  compelling  problem  for  obese  individuals  who  suffer  a  plethora  of  health  risks,  but  also  for  broader  society  in  terms  of  lost  productivity  and  whopping  healthcare  costs.  Fat  hate  undermines  an  overweight  individual's  ability  to  lose  weight  and  ignores  the  inequalities  underpinning  unhealthy  behaviours.  It  also  blames  people  for  something  which  isn't  their  fault.  If  we  really  want  to  tackle  obesity,  we  should  direct  our  hate  into  support  instead. ",2009-11-06
"  WORLD  NEWS  OF  THE  WORLD   UTTER  BASTARD  STILL  RICH   In  spite  of  the  ongoing  financial  crisis,  an  utter  bastard  is  still  quite  rich.  We  met  him  in  his  plush  inner  city  apartment,  wearing  his  usual  self-satisfied  smile  that  tells  everyone  he  meets  how  much  better  than  them  he  is.  He  explained  in  great  detail  how  rich  he  still  is  and  how  little  the  market  collapse  has  affected  his  wealth.  Rather  than  showing  humility,  he  seemed  to  have  become  even  more  smug  and  insufferable  in  the  face  of  the  world's,  financial  difficulties.  Having  retained  most  of  his  wealth,  the  fact  that  he  had  sufficient  resources  and  market  know  how  to  weather  such  a  storm  made  him  feel  smugger  than  ever  about  his  own  superiority.

WORLD  NEWS  OF  THE  WORLD   GAY  MAN:  QUITE  WELL  ADJUSTED    On  Thomas  Alderson's  twentieth  birthday,  the  North  Sydney  student  came  to  terms  with  something  he  had  known  in  his  heart  for  all  his  life.    He  was  gay.    Upon  acknowledging  this  life-changing  truth  about  his  identity,  Thomas  decided  to  go  down  the  road  to  the  24  hour  McDonalds  for  a  late  dinner.  As  the  student  of  Commerce  and  Law  explained:  ""Normally  I  get  a  Happy  Meal  but  it  seemed  kind  of  like  a  special  day  so  I  got  a  fillet'o'fish  instead.""  When  Thomas  shared  the  news  with  his  family  the  reaction  was  neither  positive  nor  negative.    When  contacted  by  Tharunka  his  mother,  Helene  Alderson,  said:  ""  He's  a  pretty  good  boy.    It  doesn't  really  matter  to  us  whether  he's  gay  or  straight,  just  as  long  as  he  finishes  his  degree.""  His  father,  Steven,  concurred:  ""Tom's  sexuality  is  quite...hmm,  yes.    Has  anyone  taken  int  he  washing?""  After  a  short  poriod  of  confusion  and  personal  agitation,  Thomas  found  that  his  life  looked  very  much  the  same  as  it  had  been  before.    He  continued  to  work,  study  and  relax  with  friends,  often  frequenting  the  local  establishment  and  sometimes  visiting  a  more  upmarket  bar  int  he  city  when  he  had  the  cash.  A  few  colleagues  at  his  part  time  job  in  a  Mosman  cafe'  may  have  displayed  some  latent  homophobia.    However  it  was  hard  to  tell  as  they  had  never  really  been  friends  anyway.  As  Thomas  observes:  ""  They  just  kind  of  grunted  when  I  told  them.    We  didn't  really  hang  out  before,  and  we  didn't  really  hang  out  afterwards  either.    So  I  don't  really  know  if  there  was  a  difference  or  not.""  Towards  the  end  of  our  interview  Thomas  became  visibly  impatient,  fidgeting  and  casting  frequent  glances  in  the  direction  of  his  watch.  He  attributed  this  state  if  mind  to  the  fact  that  he  had  promised  to  go  to  the  beach  with  his  housemate,  Andrew,  who  joined  us  towards  the  end  of  our  discussion.  When  asked  whether  his  relationship  with  Thomas  had  been  altered,  Andrew  gave  the  matter  some  consideration  before  replying  ""Um,  not  really.  Hey  do  you  know  if  we're  gonna  be  in  time  for  the  bus?""  Said  Thomas:  ""Let's  get  lunch  first.""    Youse  imigrants  need  to  speak  english!!!!    It  makes  me  real  mad  when  I  here  people  talking  foreign  languages  on  the  bus  and  in  in  the  streets  ur  in  Australia  speak  english  so  we  can  all  understand  you.    I'm  not  racist  or  nothin  but,  id  say  its  very  easy  to  learn  to  to  speak  english  I  mean  I  learned  it  as  a  baby,  so  imigrants  should  learn  it  so  they  don't  have  to  use  they're  wog  languages  in  Australia.    BIG  PACKAGE  STIMULATES  eager  Australian  economy    After  a  long  period  of  teasing  and  building  tension,  the  Australian  parliament  finally  gave  it  up  yesterday,  much  to  the  relief  and  excitement  of  an  Australian  public  begging  for  deep  and  long-lasting  stimulus.  The  much  need  stimulation  comes  after  a  period  of  sluggish  and  limp  activity,  during  which  the  economy  found  itself  too  busy,  stressed  or  sick  to  be  fully  excited.    This  package  is  expected  to  be  big  and  impressive  enough  that  Australia  will  become  aroused  to  new  heights  of  economic  activity.    Business  heads  are  swollen  with  excitement  at  th  prospect  of  getting  the  package  into  their  hands,  anticipating  that  it  will  supply  sufficient  fluidity  to  lubricate  the  wheels  of  industry.  Indeed,  experts  are  hoping    that  the  package  will  have  enough  strength  to  deliver  the  goods  and  reach  deep  enough  to  satisfy  everyone's  needs.    The  package  will  focus  particularly  on  targeting  vulnerable  areas,  activating  these  sensitive  spots  and  using  multiplier  effect  to  increase  the  amount  of  stimulation  reaching  through  parts  of  the  nation.  However,  given  the  demanding  task  at  hand,  advisors  have  warned  parliament  against  shooting  it's  load  prematurely.    They  say  that  it  will  need  to  be  flexible  in  its  approach  if  it  hopes  for  the  package  to  penetrate  everywhere  it  is  needed,  and  that  stamina  will  be  important  if  this  stimulus  is  going  to  get  the  economy  up  and  keep  it  up  for  as  long  as  necessary. &lt;p&gt; ",2009-03-06
"  IN  DEFENCE  OF  WHALING   SEAN  LAWSON   Okay.    The  Australian  consensus  against  whaling  is  virtually  universal.      All  our  political  parties  agree  on  the  issue:    Japan  are  a  bunch  of  evil  bastards  who  gleefully  murder  Free  Willy  and  drink  his  salty  whaley  blood,  or  something.    Hell,  even  John  fucking  Howard  has  joined  the  moist-eyed  concern  party  in  defence  of  the  gentle  giants  of  the  deep.    300  000  people  have  joined  the  hilariously  melodromatic  Facebook  group  ""Fuck  off  Japan,  leave  the  whales  alone!!!""  while  the  two  pro-whaling  groups  I  could  find  had  135  and  38  people,  and  they  both  might  be  parodies.    But  you  know  what?    It's  a  bunch  of  rot.  There's  a  pretty  good  case  for  sustainable  commercial  Minke  whale  hunting  industry,  and  the  entire  Australian  position  seems  to  be  based  on  a  mixture  of  ignorance  and  pure  squeamishness.    First  of  all,  how  many  of  the  300  000  bogans  int  he  ""fuck  off  Japan""  Facebook  group  know  that  Norway  and  Iceland  also  hunt  whales?    Hell,  Japan  learnt  modern  whale-hunting  from  Norway  during  the  19th  century.    Not  only  do  these  vicious  Viking  fuckers  up  north  kill  whales,  but  they  do  it  commercially.  not  scientifically.    Why  does  Japan  get  all  the  attention  when  Iceland  kills  250  minke  whales  a  year,  or  roughly  one  per  1000  Icelanders?    Second,  The  whales  being  hunted  are  simply  not  endangered.    Contrary  to  what  people  seem  to  think,  ""the  whale""  is  not  one  species  but  many.    The  Blue  whale  is  critically  endangered.    The  Right  whale  is  also  threatened.    However,  the  vast  majority  of  whales  Japan  and  others  kill  are  Minke  Whales,  and  it's  these  which  will  be  the  basis  for  any  future  commercial  industry.    Minkes  number  800  000  or  more  (there  are  4  times  as  many  as  Minke  whales  as  Icelandic  people)  and  have  never  been  endangered.    Japan  kills  less  than  500  a  year,  and  even  before  the  commercial  whaling  ban  the  Japanese  fleet  killed  about  2000  minke  whales  per  year.    That's  about  0.25%  of  the  total  Minke  population.    For  comparison,  Australian's  annual  kangaroo  quota  is  2  million  of  25  million,  or  roughly  8%  of  total  numbers.    We  monsters.    In  1986,  the  International  Whaling  Commission  passed  a  moratorium  on  the  whaling  industry,  which  meant  a  ban  except  for  a  few  exceptions  for  some  Arctic  indigenous  badasses  who  hunt  small  numbers  of  whales  in  hella  dangerous  little  kayaks.      As  with  all  things  the  IWC  does,  the  vote  was  a  bit  of  a  joke.  A  bunch  of  rich  western  nations  in  the  thrall  of  the  new  wave  of  environmentalism  found  a  way  they  take  a  consequence-free  stand  on  a  green  issue.    They  mobbed  the  vote  and  Japan  lacked  small  countries  to  bribe  for  their  vote  in  its  favour  (something  they're  working  hard  to  recify  as  they  stack  pliant  and  bribeable  new  members  like  Mongolia  into  the  Commission).    Norway  and  Iceland  just  opted  out  and  kept  on  hunting,  but  for  some  reason  Japan  didn't,  instead  reacting  by  switching  to  scientific  whaling.  The  thing  is,  the  ban  really  affects  fishermen.    Icelandic  fishermen  argue  that  since  whales  eat  half  a  million  tonnes  of  fish  a  year,  they  are  a  predator  that  needs  to  be  controlled  in  order  to  protect  fishing  stocks  (their  biggest  industry,  now  their  financial  system  has  collapsed  and  Björk  is  no  longer  popular).    Japan  argues  something  similar,  but  it  also  has  a  lot  if  unemployed  fishermen  owing  to  the  drastically  reduced  fishing  quotas  that  it's  gotten  from  countries  like  the  USA  since  the  1980's.   So  what  about  this  scientific  whaling  business?  It's  a  bit  of  a  fig-leaf  ind  a  legal  fiction,  but  ask  yourself,  how  the  hell  else  do  you  collect'samples  of  a  giant  swimming  animal?  As  far  as  I  can  tell,  Japan  primarily  does  scientific  whaling  thing  as  a  'fuck  you'  to  the  countries  that  banned  it  from  commercial  whaling  and  to  keep  the  whalers  in  jobs  and  well  practised.  However,  it's  also  trying  to  build  up  data  arguing  for  the  possibility  of  a  managed,  sustainable  hunt  (you  can  see  a  list  of  the  scientific  papers  they've  submitted  at  http://luna.pos.to/whale/icr_papers.html).  The  irony  is  that  the  anti-whaling  countries  refuse  to  accept  a  simple  head-count  as  evidence,  which  lets  the  Japanese  argue  that  they  need  ""lethal  sampling""  in  order  to  build  up  population  distribution  models  and  convince  them.  When  you  get  right  down  to  it,  the  international  debate  over  whaling  is  absolutely  fucking  absurd.  It's  political  theatre  of  the  worst  kind.  Firstly,  since  when  do  fucking  Labor  or  the  Liberals  give  a  shit  about  green  issues?  It's  like  watching  Alan  Jones  and  other  old  misogynist  bastards  suddenly  discover""  feminism,  when  they  can  use  it  as  a  club  to  bash  Muslims  with.  Meanwhile,  the  Japanese  continue  •  acting  all  persecuted  when  they've  got  the  3rd  biggest  economy  and  8th  highest  military  spending  in'  the  world  and  could  very  easily  have  just  toughened  the  fuck  up,  objected  to  the  moratorium,  andkept  hunting  like  the  Norwegians..  /  It's  a  funny  debate.  It  doesn't-matter  in  geopolitical  terms,  but  emotions  run  incredibly  high  withgovernments  indulging  in  incredibly  bellicose  rhetoric.  There's  never  any  effort  to  compromise  nor  spirit  of  moderation,  because  that  would  look  weak.  It's  always  ""stop  the  whaling,  you  yellow  .  barbarians!!!""  versus  ""you  haif^  monkey  bastard  cultural  imperialists  are  conspiring  against  us!!!""  The  inconsequential  nature  of  the  issue  gives  governments  orfâ-J.1  sides  a  chance  to  talk  real  tough  and  act  all  belligerent  over  something  that  isn't  going  to  have  conséquences  for  any  of  them.  They'd  all  *  '5  much  rather  yell  at  each  other  because  it's  politically  cheaper.  It  keeps  the.peons  impressed  with  your  decisiveness  and  pumped  up  with  national  pride.  After  ail,  as  a  diplomat  or  statesman,  you  can't  carry  on  like  this  over  nuclear  weapons  or  terrorism.  That  shit  has  actual  consequences.   Even  more  than  that,  for  either  side  to  yield  and  create  a  moderate  solution  involving  IWC  oversight  and  strict  quotas  would  cause  political  problems  for  both  sides.  The  Japanese  government  would  be  accused  of  selling  out  the  national  interest  to  foreign  cultural  imperialists  or  something,  whilst  governments  like  Australia  would  be  accused  of  being  soft  on  the  slaughter  of  innocent  whales.  So  it's  easier  for  everyone  involved  to  keep  yelling  about  it  instead.   Look,  there  are  some  good  arguments  against  whaling.  It's  gross  and  ugly,  and  it'd  be  nice  if  the  exploding  grenade  head  shots  had  a  higher  instant  kill  ratio.  Whales  are  smart  and  they're  near  the  top  of  the  food  pyramid.  They're  pretty  and  live  in  the  oceans  (although  that  doesn't  help  swordfish).  Our  inability  to  effectively  manage  the  ocean  and  its  resources  might  be  an  argument  for  leaving  the  fuckers  alone  completely.  There's  also  a  case  that  whaling  impacts  on  other  economic  activities  like  whale-watching  and  tourism.  But  in  the  end,  whales  are  an  ecological  resource  just  like  any  other,  and  it's  stupid  to  take  a  fundamentalist  NO  WHALING  EVER  policy  if  it's  not  achieving  anything  except  to  make  Japan  dig  its  heels  in  further.  We  should  be  negotiating  with  them,  trying  to  get  them  to  agree  to  sustainable  quotas  and  international  oversight,  instead  of  having  our  policy  set  by  a  bunch  of  angry  bogans  on  Facebook  and  populist  politicos  scoring  cheap  political  points.   Not  only  do  those  vicious  Viking  fuckers  up  north  kill  whales,  but  they  do  it  commercially,  not  scientifically ",2009-05-01
"  WNOTW  WOMEN   BY  SU-MIN  LIM   RIGHTWINGER  CARES  ABOUT  WOMEN  ALL  OF  A  SUDDEN   Andrew  Hampton,  a  self-identified  conservative,  has  for  many  years  expressed  indifference  or  outright  hostility  towards  the  women's  movement  and  its  goals.  He  is  disdainful  towards  his  female  colleagues  at  work,  thinks  paid  maternity  leave  is  a  'waste  of  money',  and  is  a  bit  iffy  about  the  criminalisation  of  marital  rape.  On  the  latter  topic,  he  has  been  heard  to  remark  to  friends  that  'If  she  didn't  want  it,  why  did  she  marry  him?'  However,  whenever  Muslims  are  mentioned  Hampton  transforms  into  a  passionate  advocate  of  women's  liberation  and  feminine  equality.  'It's  disgusting  what  they  do  to  their  women  over  there,'  he  confided  over  a  Tooheys  at  his  local  establishment.  'It  just  goes  to  show  that  they're  not  civilised  like  us.  We  let  our  women  do  what  they  want,  like  voting  and  going  out  sometimes  so  long  as  they  still  look  after  the  kiddies.'  Taking  a  long  drink  of  his  beer,  Hampton  became  emotional  as  he  contemplated  the  oppression  of  his  sisters  in  the  Islamic  world.  'I've  heard  they  make  their  women  wear  a  black  thing  over  their  faces.  My  girlfriend  dresses  nice  for  me,  and  I  certainly  appreciate  it.'  At  this  point  Hampton's  girlfriend  Andrea  arrived  at  the  bar,  beaming  and  dressed  in  a  denim  mini  skirt  which  he  pronounced  'hot'.  The  bartender  professed  to  share  this  opinion,  which  seemed  to  please  Andrea,  and  the  two  struck  up  a  jovial  but  platonic  conversation.  Hampton,  however,  became  progressively  surlier,  finally  standing  up  abruptly  to  tell  her  that  'We're  going  home.'  Onlookers  predicted  the  couple's  relations  that  night  would  not  be  cordial.   WOMAN  REASSURES  MEN  SHE  IS  'NOT  A  FEMINIST'  Yesterday  afternoon,  a  woman  was  seen  to  reassure  her  male  friends  that  she  is  not  a  feminist'.  She  noted  that  she  has  a  boyfriend  and  is  not  a  lesbian,  in  a  manner  that  made  it  clear  she  considers  such  a  sexual  orientation  to  be  deeply  undesirable.  She  then  went  on  to  observe  that  she  did  not  'hate  men'.  Finally,  she  drew  attention  to  the  fact  that  she  frequently  shaves  her  armpits  and  legs,  a  remark  greeted  by  the  gathering  with  considerable  hilarity.  Her  male  companions  congratulated  her  for  adopting  this  courageous  stance  and  resolved  to  tell  their  feminist-identifying  female  friends  of  this  exceptional  woman's  existence.  Reports  that  the  woman  has  been  observed  attending  university,  using  contraception  and  participating  in  paid  employment  for  a  salary  equal  to  her  male  counterparts  remain  unconfirmed.  MAN  BLAMES  FAILURE  TO  PICK  UP  ON  BEING  'TOO  NICE'  All  over  the  world,  millions  of  nice  men  are  enjoying  happy  and  fulfilling  relationships  with  their  girlfriends,  wives  and  partners.  Nice  men  are  sharing  intimate  and  hilarious  moments  with  their  loved  ones,  rolling  on  beds  and  floors  in  erotic  adventures  and  celebrating  the  excitement,  affection  and  pleasure  that  a  romantic  relationship  can  bring.  25  year  old  Dennis  Potter,  however,  is  convinced  that  his  own  singleness,  loneliness  and  sexual  frustration  can  be  solely  attributed  to  his  being  'too  nice'.  'Girls  say  they  want  to  be  treated  right,  but  they  always  go  for  the  arseholes,'  he  claimed.  He  then  went  on  to  describe  in  elaborate  detail  the  fourteen  occasions  over  the  past  month  on  which  he  had  attempted  to  convince  a  woman  to  have  sexual  intercourse  with  him,  without  success.  'Women  these  days  have  no  self  respect.  They  just  go  with  sleazebags  who  just  want  to  get  laid,'  he  concluded.  Dennis  then  proceeded  to  illustrate  his  'niceness'  in  a  random  encounter  with  a  moderately  attractive  women  in  her  twenties.  He  approached  the  woman,  smiling  somewhat  toothily,  and  asked  if  he  could  buy  her  a  drink.   While  they  were  both  seated  at  the  bar,  he  demonstrated  his  interest  in  her  individuality  and  character  by  asking  where  she  worked  and  if  she  had  a  boyfriend.  He  also  said  he  liked  her  dress  although  he  wasn't  really  looking  at  it.  When  asked  about  himself,  he  stated  that  he  was  'pretty  boring  really',  with  a  self-deprecating  laugh  which  indicated  that  the  woman  was  required  to  assure  him  he  wasn't.  She  performed  this  rote  without  enthusiasm,  but  soon  remembered  that  she  had  to  go  home  early  because  she  had  an  appointment  the  next  day.  When  she  exited  the  bar,  Dennis  immediately  became  furious.  'Another  one  of  those  hos  leeching  off  me.  She's  just  like  all  the  rest  of  them!'  Dennis  grew  more  and  more  aggressive  as  the  hours  wore  on,  banging  the  table  to  emphasise  his  point  that  'There's  only  one  way  to  deal  with  women.  Treat  'em  mean  to  make  'em  keen.'  A  woman  sitting  nearby  cast  him  a  disapproving  look,  causing  him  to  mutter  viciously  into  the  table  'Bitch'.  GIRL  JUST  WANTS  TO  HAVE  FUN  Sonja  Henriksson,  18,  has  a  single  goal:  to  achieve  pleasure  and  lightness  and  enjoy  her  life.  Her  pursuit  of  this  ambition  sometimes  causes  her  to  arrive  home  late,  leading  her  mother  to  question  when  she  intends  to  live  in  a  'right'  or  proper  fashion.  Late  night  phone  calls  also  cause  considerable  stress  to  her  father,  although  Sonja  is  keen  to  reassure  him  that  he  is  still  'number  one'  in  her  affections.  Sonja's  previous  boyfriend  sought  to  restrict  her  activities  and  to  conceal  her  beauty  from  others,  but  the  relationship  disintegrated  after  Sonja  repeatedly  and  emphatically  expressed  her  desire  to  'walk  in  the  sun',  an  aim  with  which  he  did  not  sympathise.  Sonja  told  Tharunka  that  pleasure  and  enjoyment  are  inherently  desired  by  all  girts.  'You  can't  really  say  why.  They  just  wanna!'  she  explained.   HOT  CHICK  IN  MOVIE  INEXPLICABLY  ATTRACTED  TO  LOSER  In  a  movie  you  watched  recently,  the  protagonist  was  a  physically  unattractive  male  of  lower  than  average  intelligence  who  spent  his  time  either  hanging  with  douchebags  or  moping  about  his  directionless  existence  without  actually  doing  anything  to  change  it.  Halfway  through  the  movie,  however,  he  became  acquainted  with  a  woman  with  a  dazzling  smile,  perfect  skin,  extensive  wardrobe  and  large  breasts.  For  reasons  indecipherable  to  the  audience,  the  hot  woman  gradually  succumbed  to  the  protagonist's  charms  and  they  started  dating.  The  protagonist  achieved  a  newfound  maturity  through  the  relationship  while  retaining  affection  for  his  hilarious  old  stoner  buddies.  The  woman  continued  to  be  hot  and  to  exhibit  her  breasts  in  a  variety  of  outfits,  much  to  the  audience's  gratification.  EVERYTHING  NOW  EMPOWERING  According  to  third  wave  feminist  Dr  Kathleen  Brunswick,  everything  women  do  is  now  empowering.  Empowerment  has  traditionally  been  defined  as  the  ability  to  govern  your  own  tife  according  to  your  abilities.  For  Dr  Brunswick,  however,  modern  examples  of  female  empowerment  include:  going  to  work,  staying  at  home,  wearing  a  burqa,  wearing  stilettos,  keeping  your  name  after  you  get  married,  not  keeping  your  name,  having  a  name  and  sleeping.  ""Oldschool  feminists  wanted  to  tell  women  what  to  do.  They  wanted  to  say  it's  better  to  have  rights  and  exercise  them  than  to  be  exploited,  manipulated  and  abused.  Well,  I'm  very  grateful  for  our   grandmothers  but  that  thinking  is  pretty  outdated  in  2009.'  Previous  generations  of  feminists  wanted  women  to  expand  their  lives,  encouraging  them  to  break  into  spheres  such  as  politics,  the  workforce  and  intellectual  life.  Theorists  such  as  Dr  Brunswick,  however,  see  things  differently.  'Who  are  we  feminists  to  say  it's  not  OK  for  a  woman  to  be  emotionally  and  financially  dependant  on  male  approval?  Modern  women  are  all  about  choice.  Allowing  people  to  wipe  their  feet  on  you  is  a  choice.  Some  women  like  being  a  floormat.'  Women  across  the  country  greeted  Dr  Brunswick's  remarks  with  relief.  32  year  old  mother  of  five  Peta  said:  'Here  I  was  thinking  I  was  ""downtrodden  just  because  I'm  unable  to  work  for  lack  of  childcare,  my  boyfriend  ignores  my  sexual  needs  and  my  gender  is  hugely  underrepresented  in  Parliament.  Now  I  understand  this  is  all  part  of  my  choice  to  have  a  uterus  and  clitoris.  Feminism  is  even  easier  than  doing  the  laundry!  Speaking  of  laundry...'  100  MILLION  WOMEN  MISSING  WORLDWIDE  DUE  TO  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE,  SEX  SELECTIVE  ABORTION  AND  INEQUITABLE  ALLOCATION  OF  FOOD  AND  HEALTHCARE  RESOURCES.
